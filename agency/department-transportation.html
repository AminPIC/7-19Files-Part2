Boyd. Today, over 57,000 DOT employees work in the Offices of the Secretary of Transportation, the Office of the Inspector General, ten Operating Administrations, and the Surface Transportation Board.</p>
<p>The Operating Administrations are listed below.  More information about DOT is available at <a href="http://www.dot.gov/about">http://www.dot.gov/about</a> and at the Web sites of each Operating Administration.</p>
<p>Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)</p>
<p>Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)</p>
<p>Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA)</p>
<p>Federal Railroad Administration (FRA)</p>
<p>Federal Transit Administration (FTA)</p>
<p>Maritime Administration (MARAD)</p>
<p>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)</p>
<p>Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA)</p>
<p>Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation (SLSDC)</p>
<p>According to the US Census, the U.S. population is projected to increase to 332 million by 2017, a 70 percent increase since 1967.  The national economy is on the rebound and personal travel continues to increase, albeit at a somewhat slower pace than prior to the 2008 recession.  Industries and consumers depend increasingly on the reliable and timely flow of goods and services within and across our Nation’s borders.</p>
<p>Population growth in cities and mega-regions is placing a strain on existing transportation systems and creating demand for more transportation choices.  As people continue to increase their demand for vibrant communities, creating livable communities with safe, reliable, and affordable transportation choices for all users is essential to ensuring economic vitality and growth. The increasing amount and availability of information, as well as more rapid emergence and adoption of new technologies, is transforming all aspects of our daily life including how we travel to work and spend our leisure time. Utilizing emerging technology, maintaining and improving existing transportation infrastructure, and ensuring multimodal options for the movement of goods and people ensures reliable performance of the transportation system; a system critical to attracting the strong workforce that makes a community thrive.</p>
<p>In response to these trends, this second edition of the DOT strategic plan, <em>Transportation for a New Generation,</em> outlines the approach that we are undertaking to achieve our strategic goals and implement the President’s priorities for Fiscal Year (FY) 2014-2018.  We are acting under the authorities that the Congress and the President have provided the Secretary of Transportation.</p>

<div class="intro_text">
<p>Established by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goals are a tool used to accelerate progress on a limited number of priority areas where implementation requires active collaboration between multiple agencies, overcoming organizational barriers to achieve better performance than one agency can achieve on its own.</p>
<p>Set or revised at least every four years, CAP Goals include outcome-oriented goals that cover a limited number of crosscutting policy areas as well as management goals focused on management improvements across the Federal Government in areas of financial management, strategic human capital management, information technology management, procurement and acquisition management, and real property management.</p>
<p>A series of 16 CAP Goals were announced in the 2015 Budget with clearly named accountable officials, data-driven reviews that incorporated a broad range of quantitative and qualitative inputs, and reporting to the public through a common website as a framework to drive performance improvements on cross-government collaboration and tackle government-wide management challenges affecting most agencies.</p>

<p>On June 30, 2016, the President signed into law the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 – nearly 50 years after President Johnson signed the original FOIA into law.  This critical legislation reflects the progress made by the Administration, codifies a number of openness and transparency principles, and ensures that the Administration’s track record of openness is institutionalized throughout government and carries forward for years to come.  Concurrent with the signing of the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, the White House released a Fact Sheet committing the Administration to:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Utilizing the Chief FOIA Officers Council and FOIA Advisory Committee to address FOIA’s greatest challenges;</p>

</div>  </div>  
  <div class="views-field views-field-field-cag-overview-revision-id">    <span class="views-label views-label-field-cag-overview-revision-id">Overview: </span>    <div class="field-content"><p>On March 19, 2015, the President issued Executive Order 13693, <em>Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade</em>, which set forth ambitious climate, energy, and environmental sustainability goals for Federal agencies over the next decade.  Executive departments and agencies have been among our Nation’s leaders as the United States works to build a clean energy economy that will sustain our prosperity and the health of our people and our environment for generations to come. Federal leadership in energy, environmental water, transportation fleets, buildings, and acquisition management will continue to drive national greenhouse gas reductions and support preparations for the impacts of climate change. The Federal Government has the opportunity to significantly reduce direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2025, while at the same time fostering innovation, reducing spending, and strengthening the communities in which our Federal facilities operate. </p>
<p>Employing this strategy for the next decade calls for expanded and updated Federal environmental performance goals with a clear overarching objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions across Federal operations and the Federal supply chain.  Goals for greenhouse gas emissions reduction (40% by 2025), renewable electricity (30% by 2025), clean energy (25% by 2025), and performance contracting ($4 billion in awarded contracts by Dec. 2016) are already well established in the Federal community. The enhanced target for each of these goals will require agencies to sharpen their focus on achieving the goals through existing mechanisms and new technologies that enhance efficiency and use of clean energy.</p>
<p>CEQ and OMB have worked closely to ensure that Federal agencies understand the necessary steps to pursuing the new environmental sustainability goals and those efforts are supported by an interagency Steering Committee.  Pursuit of these sustainability goals will involve at least 25 of the largest Federal agencies. Success will be greatly enhanced by the cross-cutting nature of the goals and the similarity in the tools and procedures used for implementation.</p>
<p>While all Federal agencies have an important role to play in ensuring the Government meets its energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets, key delivery agencies include: The General Services Administration, Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Energy, National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Department of Homeland Security.</p>

In the wake of increasing threats and incidents, the President directed a series of reviews to examine current security, suitability/fitness, and credentialing processes and to recommend areas in need of reform. The interagency reviews identified problem areas and made specific recommendations, which were approved by the Performance Accountability Council (PAC). The PAC developed the Strategic Intent to build upon these efforts and create a lasting impact by providing overarching strategic direction to personnel security, suitability/fitness, and credentialing reform efforts for the next five years.  </p>
<p>The Strategic Intent represents our framework for sustaining progress mandated by the February 2014 Suitability and Security Processes Review Report to the President, the January 2016 PAC Review of Background Investigations, relevant legislation, and other key drivers. It builds on progress since the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 and the subsequent, significant reform efforts that resulted in greater standardization and alignment of suitability and security processes. Through this framework, the PAC will work with other members of the Executive Branch to drive continuous process improvement to personnel security, suitability/fitness, and credentialing programs and address evolving threats. While we cannot eliminate risk altogether, it is imperative that we work across disciplines to maximize our collective efforts to mitigate the risks we face, while ensuring appropriate protections for privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. We must ensure measures to improve these programs avoid imposing unreasonable burdens on the Federal workforce that could negatively impact operations. Therefore, the Federal Government will pursue a balanced approach by addressing the risks posed by personnel who could do significant harm by virtue of the nature of their position.</p>
<p>These reforms will further support ongoing Insider Threat Program implementation by providing earlier detection and improving the quality of vetting. The improved attention to cybersecurity will reinforce efforts to protect sensitive mission data, including personally-identifiable information. </p>

According to AT Kearney’s Foreign Direct Investment Confidence Index, confidence in the U.S. as a location for FDI is high, ranking as the top destination for investment ahead of China, Brazil, Canada, and India.<sup>1 </sup>The U.S. remains the world’s largest economy and is also the largest recipient of foreign direct investment in the world. Over the last ten years, U.S. affiliates of foreign companies have employed more than five million workers, the majority of which are high-paying manufacturing jobs. On average, jobs created by FDI in United States pay up to 30% more.<sup>2</sup>  However, due to global capital mobility and increased foreign competition, we need to take steps to maintain and grow our share of global investment.</p>
<p>Historically, we have left our states and cities to compete for investments with a country’s investment promotion agency, limiting our opportunities to clearly demonstrate our commitment to attracting investment and to leverage our advantages as a top destination for investment. In 2011, through Executive Order, the U.S. launched SelectUSA, the first Federal effort to promote and facilitate inbound business investment. The E.O. created the Interagency Investment Working Group (IIWG) to further design and implement the first-ever coordinated U.S. investment promotion authority. As a driver for success, the global investment team, consisting of both SelectUSA headquarters in DC and investment teams at posts led by Ambassadors, will increase the number of active investment cases touched to encourage business investments.</p>
<p>At the first SelectUSA Investment Summit in Oct 31-Nov. 1 2013, the President reformed SelectUSA, creating a number of firsts: for the first time there will be a clear system for advocacy for high-priority, job-creating investments, driven by the most senior Administration officials all the way up to the President; for the first time there will be a single point of contact for ready investors looking to bring jobs and production to the U.S.; lastly, the Administration is engaging in unprecedented coordinated support for states and localities to attract investment.</p>
<p>Key contributing agencies to the Job-Creating Investment CAP goal include the Department of Commerce, Small Business Administration, US Department of Agriculture, Department of State, Department of Homeland Security, and Export-Import Bank of the U.S.</p>

Over time, the process and legal requirements for the permitting and review of major infrastructure projects have developed in a siloed and ad-hoc way, creating complex processes that in some cases have taken years or longer to complete.  Although there are several reasons why a major infrastructure project may be delayed (including applicant funding uncertainty and state and local reviews), over the past three years the Administration has undertaken an ambitious effort to modernize the Federal government’s role in permitting and review processes.</p>
<p>To ensure his Administration took action to modernize these permitting and review processes, on March 22, 2012, the President signed Executive Order 13604, Improving Performance of Federal Permitting and Review of Infrastructure Projects and subsequently a Presidential Memorandum on May 17, 2013, charging an interagency Steering Committee to lead the development of a plan to turn best practices into standard practice.  This Implementation Plan identifies four strategies, 15 reforms, and nearly 100 both near-term and long-term milestones.  The strategies are:</p>
<ul><li>Strategy 1: Institutionalize Interagency Coordination and Transparency, by formalizing interagency coordination policies, including early identification of a lead agency; synchronizing Federal review and permitting processes and decisions; standardizing the use of the Infrastructure Permitting Dashboard; and identifying best practices for early engagement with State, Local and Tribal governments.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Strategy 2:  Improve Project Planning, Siting, and Application Quality by developing tools to assist project applicants in planning for a major infrastructure project and support effective and timely decision-making by agency staff once the Federal processes begins. </li>
</ul><ul><li>Strategy 3: Improve Permitting Reviews and Mitigation by supporting agency staff in effectively implementing existing regulations, policies, and guidance as well as identifying barriers. This strategy also includes policies to facilitate advance planning for the mitigation of project impacts and landscape- or watershed-level approaches to mitigation, where appropriate.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Strategy 4: Drive Continued Improvement.  Fully implementing these actions and achieving the President’s goal will require a team dedicated to implementing the reforms on an interagency basis, further analyze agency processes, and identify additional reforms.  This strategy includes a proposal to establish a dedicated interagency team to support the ongoing improvement of Federal permitting and review responsibilities for major infrastructure projects.  In addition, this strategy includes a proposal to develop reliable metrics to track timeframes and outcomes for communities and the environment.</li>

Advances in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) have long been central to our Nation’s ability to manufacture better and smarter products, improve health care, develop cleaner and more efficient domestic energy sources, preserve the environment, safeguard national security, and grow the economy. For the United States to maintain its preeminent position in the world it will be essential that the Nation continues to lead in STEM, but evidence indicates that current educational pathways are not leading to a sufficiently large and well-trained STEM workforce to achieve this goal, nor is the U.S. education system cultivating a culture of STEM education necessary for a STEM-literate public. Thus it is essential that the United States enhance U.S. students’ engagement in STEM disciplines and inspire and equip many more students to excel in STEM fields.</p>
<p>A number of Federal agencies place a high priority on STEM education and have developed education initiatives unique to their agency’s mission, needs, and resources.  To better leverage Federal assets, expertise, and partnerships toward a goal of national importance, a cross agency priority to improve STEM education has been developed to increase agency coordination and use of evidence-based approaches to improve P-12 STEM instruction, increase and sustain youth and public engagement in STEM, enhance the STEM experience of undergraduate students, better serve groups historically underrepresented in STEM fields, design graduate education for tomorrow’s STEM workforce, build new models for leveraging assets and expertise, and build and use evidence-based approaches. </p>

</div>  </div>  
  <div class="views-field views-field-field-cag-overview-revision-id">    <span class="views-label views-label-field-cag-overview-revision-id">Overview: </span>    <div class="field-content"><p>The American people deserve a Government that is responsive to their needs. Citizens and businesses expect government services to be well-designed, efficient, and generally comparable to the services they receive from leading private sector organizations. Whether they call the IRS for an answer to a tax question or visit a Social Security Administration office to adjust their benefits, they should experience high-quality interactions with the Federal Government. Despite some important strides to improve customer service over the past fifteen years, too often many Federal Government services fail to meet the expectations of citizens and business, creating unnecessary hassle and cost for citizens, businesses, and the government itself.  The Federal Government must keep pace with the public’s expectations and transform its customer services – soliciting regular customer feedback, streamlining processes, and delivering consistent quality service across customer channels.</p>
<p>To that end, in April 2011 the President issued an<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/27/executive-order-streamlining-service-delivery-and-improving-customer-ser" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/27/executive-order-streamlining-service-delivery-and-improving-customer-ser">Executive Order</a> requiring each agency to develop a customer service plan that identified implementation steps for their customer service activities, including a "signature initiative" that uses technology to improve the customer experience. Agencies posted the plans on their Open Government websites in October 2011, and this goal will build on these plans to streamline and improve customer service delivery.</p>
<p>To build upon the progress being made by individual agencies, the Administration is taking action to deliver improved customer service across the Federal enterprise.  The Administration will:</p>
<ul><li><em>Streamline transactions.</em>  Too often the processes and procedures of government have been developed piecemeal over time, and have not been regularly reexamined to ensure they are designed with the user experience in mind.  The Administration will identify transactions with a high impact on a significant number of citizens and streamline processes, better meet customer needs, and use performance measures to improve services.  This includes areas such as TSA security screening, veterans’ pension and disability applications, income-based repayment of student loans, Social Security, and taxpayer assistance.</li>
<li><em>Develop standards for high impact services.</em>  Citizen expectations for government services are continually increasing, driven by improvements in technology and the high quality services provided by the private sector.  Government leaders have a responsibility to understand customer expectations and service needs, and continually evaluate and improve their effectiveness in meeting those needs.  To facilitate this, many government programs that provide direct services to the public can benefit from setting customer service standards, clearly communicating these standards to customers, and ensuring these standards are being met.  The Administration will identify best practices in setting customer service standards, such as placing an emphasis on first contact resolution, and facilitate implementation of these practices for high impact services.</li>
<li><em>Utilize technology to improve the customer experience.</em>  The Administration will work to deliver world-class customer services to citizens by making it faster and easier for individuals and businesses to complete transactions with government online.  Given the continually growing importance of online services, the Administration has established a separate Cross-Agency Priority Goal to focus resources and attention on this priority area. </li>

The Administration will work with agencies to utilize existing authorities to attract top talent and consult with Agencies, the Office of Personnel Management, and Congressional stakeholders to expand the use of flexible hiring authorities. The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will also work with Agencies to incubate and scale new approaches to the design, development and delivery of top digital services and transactions.</li>
<li>Get the best companies working with government. The Administration’s efforts in this area will focus on streamlining the Federal IT acquisition process. Specific initiatives include creating more visibility of contracting opportunities for small, innovative companies; maximizing the use of available contracting flexibilities and best practices; and recommending administrative changes to the IT procurement processes.</li>
<li>Put the right processes and practices in place to drive outcomes and accountability. OMB will create and apply a new oversight and management process to highest impact IT investments in the Federal government. This process will include the best IT development and management approaches employed by the public and private sectors.  Lessons learned from this oversight process will be used to expand best practices across all agency IT investments.</li>

Today, proposals for contracts are lengthy, overly prescriptive, and laden with Government-specific requirements. There is also staggering duplication of contracts across Government and very little information sharing between agencies on pricing or other important contractual information. In order to fundamentally improve how taxpayer dollars are used in the Federal contracting space, the Administration is embarking on a comprehensive initiative to enhance collaboration and cooperation and drive greater innovation and improved performance through the implementation of Category Management.</p>
<p>This cross-agency priority (CAP) goal is focused on category management and will build on the progress made in the strategic sourcing initiative, leveraging the consolidated purchasing power of the Government to buy smarter and reduce duplication.  Category management is a new, more strategic approach that will enable the federal government to buy smarter and more like a single enterprise.  It involves identifying core areas of spend, developing heightened levels of expertise, leveraging shared best practices, providing streamlined solutions for acquisition, and managing supply and demand.  The objective is to increase efficiency and effectiveness while reducing costs and redundancies.  The first area of focus for category management is information technology and the CAP goal will support this initiative.  The objectives of the Category Management CAP goal will be expanded as the Category Management Leadership Council endorses other areas of focus.  The CAP Goal metrics can be found on the “supporting materials tabs” and progress updates will begin in the final Quarter of FY15.  </p>

If we are focused, committed, systematic, and intentional, we can make the sort of transformative changes in our service delivery approach that have altered the course of the commercial retail marketplace and reinvigorated American manufacturing. </p>
<p>We need to commit to driving efficiencies by creating opportunities to leverage existing resources and pool the government’s buying power.  This involves building common standards for underlying support activities and systems and driving out redundancy in administrative service provision.  It means changing agency expectations and incentives for spending.  And it means rethinking the way that the government considers and funds long-term investments in the systems and infrastructure that support customer service delivery. </p>
<p>The Federal Government will leverage the Executive Councils to develop common standards and benchmarks to measure shared service utilization, performance, and cost. Mandate those standards and benchmarks for common administrative services. From these standards and benchmarks we will drive efficiencies and greater performance by: 1) increasing the capacity of the Federal Shared Service Providers (SSPs) at DOI, USDA, Treasury, HHS, DOT and DOD; and 2) requiring use of lower-cost, higher-performing Shared Services for all agencies and SSPs which cannot meet established targets. We will target the following areas for Shared Services (listed in order of priority): financial, HR, technology, and acquisition.</p>

<p>The Administration will sustain and intensify these efforts in the second term by:</p>
<ul><li>Establishing cost and quality benchmarks for core/administrative operations, such as HR, Finance, Acquisition, and IT.  We will leverage the agency executive councils to develop common standards and benchmarks to measure shared service utilization, performance, and cost.  We will then use those standards and benchmarks for common administrative services as the baseline for driving continuous improvements in performance.</li>
<li>Cutting improper payments.

<p>The Administration has made significant progress in improving the management of information resources to increase interoperability and openness. In executive order 13642 President Obama outlined a clear vision for “Making Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information” wherever possible and legally permissible. The subsequently released Open Data Policy (OMB memorandum M-13-13) directed agencies to effectively “manage the information as a strategic asset” throughout its lifecycle and make data open by default to the extent permitted by law, while ensuring strict controls to safeguard individual privacy, confidentiality, and national security. </p>
<p>As a direct result, Americans are getting better access to government information and services they need. Homeowners who are struggling to pay their mortgages now get prompt, clear responses because companies are competing based on open consumer financial product complaint data published by CFPB, and can stay in their homes. Similarly, patients can now comparison shop to see which hospitals have the best outcomes and best prices thanks to data published by Medicaid and HHS—including a new dataset that for the first time shows what hospitals charge for inpatient services associated with the 100 most common kinds of hospital stays, revealing huge variations in hospital charges across the country and even within metro areas.</p>
<p>To drive further impact and results, the Open Data CAP Goal will focus on a series of government-wide objectives, strategies and major metrics that facilitate and gauge the outcome-oriented and management improvement goals of Open Data.  Metrics will prioritize three channels of impact measurement: impact on economic value creation organizations, impact on existing public program outcomes, and impact on internal government efficiency.  </p>

                    <p>Agencies establish a variety of organizational goals to drive progress toward key outcomes for the American people. Long-term strategic goals articulate clear statements of what the agency wants to achieve to advance its mission and address relevant national problems, needs, challenges and opportunities. Strategic objectives define the outcome or management impact the agency is trying to achieve, and also include the agency's role. Each strategic objective is tracked through a suite of performance goals, indicators and other evidence.

Between 2001 and 2010, an average of 13 people in the United States died every year in incidents related to the transportation of hazardous material—a rate of one death for every 21 billion ton-miles of hazardous material moved.  In addition to causing deaths and injuries, hazardous material transportation incidents disrupt communities when people are evacuated from their homes, business activity is curtailed, and transportation services are interrupted.  We will continue to develop and encourage the use of safety tools - such as improved data collection, risk management practices, and incident response planning - to prevent, mitigate, and respond to hazardous material transportation accidents.</p>

</p>
                                                                                  <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>Background:</p>
<p>Reducing roadway fatalities continues to be a top priority at the Department of Transportation (DOT).  Roadway crashes are among the leading causes of death in the United States, especially among young people. Over the past 10 years, there has been a 25 percent reduction in the number of fatalities on the Nation’s roadways. In 2014, there were a projected 32,675 motor vehicle fatalities. This decline in fatalities shows a continuation in the general trend downward in fatalities that started in 2006.  In fact, the projected 2014 fatality rate of 1.08 per 100 vehicle million miles traveled (VMT) is the lowest ever recorded.</p>
<p>The importance of improving transportation safety is reflected in DOT’s Strategic Plan. The Department strives to make the U.S. transportation system the safest in the world. DOT will work with all of its stakeholders — transportation agencies, elected officials, law enforcement, industry, safety advocates, novice drivers, the disability and older adult communities, and the public — to reduce transportation-related fatalities and injuries and make our roadway system safe for all users.</p>
<p>Progress toward a national roadway safety goal requires collaboration with a diverse group of stakeholders and partners across a range of disciplines.  Within DOT, the relevant operating administrations can leverage the respective resources and expertise to more effectively achieve a safer transportation environment. These organizations include the following:</p>
<ul><li>Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) provides Federal State and local partners the tools, resources, and information necessary to make sound safety investment decisions and coordinates with States to develop Strategic Highway Safety Plans (SHSP) and implement programs that improve the safety of roadway infrastructure on all public roads.</li>
<li>Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) promotes safe commercial motor vehicle (CMV) (large truck and bus) operations through education, innovation, regulation, enforcement, financial assistance, partnerships, and full accountability to reduce crashes, injuries, and fatalities on our Nation’s roadways involving CMVs.</li>
<li>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) develops vehicle safety standards, conducts research on new vehicle safety and technology, and oversees compliance, defect investigations and recalls.  NHTSA equally focuses on driver behavior by developing effective traffic safety programs, providing grant funds to States to implement these programs, and implementing national high visibility enforcement campaigns.</li>
</ul><p>Roadway fatalities impact all road users, including drivers, passengers, pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclists, commercial vehicle operators, and those who work to build and maintain the Nation’s four million miles of roadways. The  Federal government is the only entity that has the authority to establish national safety standards for vehicles, regulate interstate motor carriers, and mandate roadway safety features.</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholders:</strong></p>
<p>FHWA, FMCSA, and NHTSA have formed strategic alliances with partners from a wide array of backgrounds to enhance and forward the Nation’s roadway safety agenda through guidance, technical assistance, and development of resource materials. Many stakeholders currently address transportation safety issues independently, through individual goals, plans, and activities. Some have implemented substantial safety initiatives, and these contributions are vital to maintaining and improving roadway safety. As described in the RSP, involvement by multiple stakeholders provides opportunities for broader public outreach and for the development and implementation of cross-cutting roadway safety strategies reflecting the common interests of many parties.</p>
<p>Each partner offers unique strengths and abilities to assist each mode to deliver its programs and leverage resources in protecting the public on the Nation’s roadways.  Progress toward a national roadway safety goal requires collaboration with a diverse group of stakeholders and partners across a range of disciplines.  The agencies within DOT work with a network of partner organizations, such as State Highway Safety Offices, State transportation departments, Tribal governments, local and county traffic engineers, law enforcement agencies, public health associations, safety advocacy groups, the motorcoach industry, hazardous shipping businesses, interstate trucking operations and the auto industry on the development of evidence-based roadway safety programs, projects, and safety standards.  Such collaboration will help to integrate a broad range of factors affecting roadway safety and create more efficient and effective problem-solving synergies across the transportation industry.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<p>A number of challenges could slow down or even reverse positive trends.  Many States continue to face budget shortfalls and are under tremendous pressure to reduce services, resulting in cut backs to roadway safety programs.  Cutbacks in State, Tribal and local law enforcement agency budgets could weaken national enforcement campaigns and local traffic safety enforcement efforts.  States, Tribes, and local governments must be willing to use data-driven analytical processes to make the best and most effective safety investments.</p>
<p>Distracted driving has emerged as a new threat over the past few years as the rise of portable electronic devices has swiftly expanded.   Moreover, as in-vehicle electronic systems become ever more sophisticated and complex, distracted driving could become an even greater threat if it is not addressed in a manner keeping pace with technological advancements.  In fact, a new report by the Governors' Highway Safety Association (GHSA) cites 50 percent of the US adult population now owning smartphones and the wireless industry reports a subscription penetration rate of 102.2 percent (^1).  Also, as the economy continues to gain momentum, more recreational travel and driving may lead to higher crash rates.  Additionally, safety defects in vehicles that are not addressed in a safe and efficiently manner can lead toward more serious vehicle crashes and injuries.  Finally, the repeal of proven life-saving traffic safety laws at the State level, such as universal motorcycle helmet or primary seat belt laws, could also result in higher injuries and fatalities.  Nevertheless, significant opportunities remain for continued progress in reducing roadway fatalities.  The Department will seek new and innovative ways to serve the American people and keep our roadways safe.</p>
<p>MAP-21, The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (P.L 112-141), was signed into law by President Obama on July 6, 2012.  MAP-21 provides an increase in safety funds available for the Highway Safety Improvement Program along with a focus on performance-based programming.  Implementation of MAP-21 will rely heavily on increased partnership across State agencies with DOT.  Additionally, the shift to performance-based programming may require additional effort on the part of some States.  There are also challenges associated with improving safety with local roads and local agencies with Federal-aid program funds, as well as the capacity and willingness of States to use data-driven and analytical processes to make the best safety infrastructure investments.</p>

As a Nation, we have not adequately maintained our major roadway, transit, and rail systems. However, the federal role in achieving state of good repair varies from mode to mode.  We influence the condition of Federally-funded roadway, transit and airport infrastructure through program guidance and technical assistance provided to State departments of transportation, transit agencies, and airport authorities; through research and development we produce the knowledge, guidance and innovations needed to more effectively address the Nation’s infrastructure challenges. Public transportation systems provide service to tens of millions of Americans daily, especially in our Nation’s largest metropolitan areas.   These major transit systems, some of which are over one hundred years old, suffer from chronic under-investment and less than optimal application of asset management practices.  As a Nation, we need to meet an increasing demand for public transportation and bring transit infrastructure into a state of good repair. We will work in partnership with State departments of transportation, local transit agencies, and other grant recipients to administer Federal transit programs. We will provide financial assistance, policy direction, technical expertise, and grant compliance oversight aimed at improving transit and rail assets. We will work with Amtrak to eliminate the backlog of projects in the U.S. Northeast corridor.</p>

By 2050, the U.S. population will likely increase by more than 100 million people. Highway and airport congestion are increasing, with related severe economic and environmental impacts. To address these challenges and strengthen the country’s competitive position in an increasingly global economy, the U.S. Department of Transportation has a comprehensive program to develop high-speed and intercity passenger rail. The Federal Railroad Administration manages an approximately $20 billion grant and loan portfolio focused on:</p>
<ul><li>Building new high-speed rail corridors that expand and fundamentally improve passenger transportation in the geographic regions they serve;</li>
<li>Upgrading existing intercity passenger rail corridors to improve reliability, speed, and frequency of existing services; and</li>
<li>Laying the groundwork, through corridor and state planning, for future high-speed rail services.</li>
</ul><p>For the High-Speed and Intercity Passenger Rail Program, FRA selected 153 projects across the country, with nearly 85 percent of rail investments concentrated in 6 corridors (San Francisco-Los Angeles, Boston-New York City-Washington, D.C., Seattle-Portland-Eugene, Charlotte-Washington, D.C., Chicago-St. Louis, and Chicago-Detroit). These corridors are in five mega-regions, in which about 65 percent of the U.S. population resides and which will likely absorb the bulk of future population growth.</p>
<p>FRA has developed a sophisticated grants management apparatus, laid the foundation for sustainable long-term passenger rail improvements, and strengthened industry capacity to deliver rail projects through technical assistance and strategic initiatives. FRA is strongly committed to robust stakeholder outreach, communication, and collaboration as central components of program management, allowing FRA to identify program improvements, engage in project planning and development, and provide the support necessary for grantees to carry out projects successfully.</p>

<p>The En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) System replaces the 40-year-old En Route HOST Computer System and backup system used at 20 FAA ARTCCs around the country.  ERAM is the main computer system air traffic controllers use to guide airplanes flying at high altitudes.  Air traffic control towers, terminal radar approach control facilities, the Air Traffic Control System Command Center, flight service stations, and other agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense, all connect to and use the information managed by the En Route HOST Computer System.  The original HOST computer software architecture was developed in the late 1960s and was implemented as National Airspace System (NAS) Stage A in the early 1970s.</p>
<p>For controllers, ERAM provides a user-friendly interface with customizable displays.  Trajectory modeling is more accurate than in HOST, allowing maximum airspace use, better conflict detection, and improved decision making.  ERAM will substantially increase the number of flights that can be tracked and displayed to controllers from 1,100 to 1,900.  The ERAM system also provides two functionally identical channels with dual redundancy, providing a more robust back-up capability than today's environment.  Coverage will also extend beyond facility boundaries, enabling controllers to handle additional traffic more efficiently because ERAM is designed to process data from up to 64 radars instead of the current 24.  The ERAM system is needed to replace the current HOST system and allow the FAA to continue to provide the high level of safe, reliable air traffic control services that the nation has come to expect; and also put in place the infrastructure necessary to transition the NAS to NextGen.</p>

<p>Reducing roadway fatalities continues to be a top priority at the Department of Transportation (DOT).  Roadway crashes are among the leading causes of death in the United States, especially among young people. Over the past 10 years, there has been a 25 percent reduction in the number of fatalities on the Nation’s roadways. In 2014, there were a projected 32,675 motor vehicle fatalities. This decline in fatalities shows a continuation in the general trend downward in fatalities that started in 2006.  In fact, the projected 2014 fatality rate of 1.08 per 100 vehicle million miles traveled (VMT) is the lowest ever recorded.</p>
<p>The importance of improving transportation safety is reflected in DOT’s Strategic Plan. The Department strives to make the U.S. transportation system the safest in the world. DOT will work with all of its stakeholders — transportation agencies, elected officials, law enforcement, industry, safety advocates, novice drivers, the disability and older adult communities, and the public — to reduce transportation-related fatalities and injuries and make our roadway system safe for all users.</p>
<p>Progress toward a national roadway safety goal requires collaboration with a diverse group of stakeholders and partners across a range of disciplines.  Within DOT, the relevant operating administrations can leverage the respective resources and expertise to more effectively achieve a safer transportation environment. These organizations include the following:</p>
<ul><li>Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) provides Federal State and local partners the tools, resources, and information necessary to make sound safety investment decisions and coordinates with States to develop Strategic Highway Safety Plans (SHSP) and implement programs that improve the safety of roadway infrastructure on all public roads.</li>
<li>Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) promotes safe commercial motor vehicle (CMV) (large truck and bus) operations through education, innovation, regulation, enforcement, financial assistance, partnerships, and full accountability to reduce crashes, injuries, and fatalities on our Nation’s roadways involving CMVs.</li>
<li>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) develops vehicle safety standards, conducts research on new vehicle safety and technology, and oversees compliance, defect investigations and recalls.  NHTSA equally focuses on driver behavior by developing effective traffic safety programs, providing grant funds to States to implement these programs, and implementing national high visibility enforcement campaigns.</li>
</ul><p>Roadway fatalities impact all road users, including drivers, passengers, pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclists, commercial vehicle operators, and those who work to build and maintain the Nation’s four million miles of roadways. The  Federal government is the only entity that has the authority to establish national safety standards for vehicles, regulate interstate motor carriers, and mandate roadway safety features.</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholders:</strong></p>
<p>FHWA, FMCSA, and NHTSA have formed strategic alliances with partners from a wide array of backgrounds to enhance and forward the Nation’s roadway safety agenda through guidance, technical assistance, and development of resource materials. Many stakeholders currently address transportation safety issues independently, through individual goals, plans, and activities. Some have implemented substantial safety initiatives, and these contributions are vital to maintaining and improving roadway safety. As described in the RSP, involvement by multiple stakeholders provides opportunities for broader public outreach and for the development and implementation of cross-cutting roadway safety strategies reflecting the common interests of many parties.</p>
<p>Each partner offers unique strengths and abilities to assist each mode to deliver its programs and leverage resources in protecting the public on the Nation’s roadways.  Progress toward a national roadway safety goal requires collaboration with a diverse group of stakeholders and partners across a range of disciplines.  The agencies within DOT work with a network of partner organizations, such as State Highway Safety Offices, State transportation departments, Tribal governments, local and county traffic engineers, law enforcement agencies, public health associations, safety advocacy groups, the motorcoach industry, hazardous shipping businesses, interstate trucking operations and the auto industry on the development of evidence-based roadway safety programs, projects, and safety standards.  Such collaboration will help to integrate a broad range of factors affecting roadway safety and create more efficient and effective problem-solving synergies across the transportation industry.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<p>A number of challenges could slow down or even reverse positive trends.  Many States continue to face budget shortfalls and are under tremendous pressure to reduce services, resulting in cut backs to roadway safety programs.  Cutbacks in State, Tribal and local law enforcement agency budgets could weaken national enforcement campaigns and local traffic safety enforcement efforts.  States, Tribes, and local governments must be willing to use data-driven analytical processes to make the best and most effective safety investments.</p>
<p>Distracted driving has emerged as a new threat over the past few years as the rise of portable electronic devices has swiftly expanded.   Moreover, as in-vehicle electronic systems become ever more sophisticated and complex, distracted driving could become an even greater threat if it is not addressed in a manner keeping pace with technological advancements.  In fact, a new report by the Governors' Highway Safety Association (GHSA) cites 50 percent of the US adult population now owning smartphones and the wireless industry reports a subscription penetration rate of 102.2 percent (^1).  Also, as the economy continues to gain momentum, more recreational travel and driving may lead to higher crash rates.  Additionally, safety defects in vehicles that are not addressed in a safe and efficiently manner can lead toward more serious vehicle crashes and injuries.  Finally, the repeal of proven life-saving traffic safety laws at the State level, such as universal motorcycle helmet or primary seat belt laws, could also result in higher injuries and fatalities.  Nevertheless, significant opportunities remain for continued progress in reducing roadway fatalities.  The Department will seek new and innovative ways to serve the American people and keep our roadways safe.</p>
<p>MAP-21, The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (P.L 112-141), was signed into law by President Obama on July 6, 2012.  MAP-21 provides an increase in safety funds available for the Highway Safety Improvement Program along with a focus on performance-based programming.  Implementation of MAP-21 will rely heavily on increased partnership across State agencies with DOT.  Additionally, the shift to performance-based programming may require additional effort on the part of some States.  There are also challenges associated with improving safety with local roads and local agencies with Federal-aid program funds, as well as the capacity and willingness of States to use data-driven and analytical processes to make the best safety infrastructure investments.</p>

By 2050, the U.S. population will likely increase by more than 100 million people. Highway and airport congestion are increasing, with related severe economic and environmental impacts. To address these challenges and strengthen the country’s competitive position in an increasingly global economy, the U.S. Department of Transportation has a comprehensive program to develop high-speed and intercity passenger rail. The Federal Railroad Administration manages an approximately $20 billion grant and loan portfolio focused on:</p>
<ul><li>Building new high-speed rail corridors that expand and fundamentally improve passenger transportation in the geographic regions they serve;</li>
<li>Upgrading existing intercity passenger rail corridors to improve reliability, speed, and frequency of existing services; and</li>
<li>Laying the groundwork, through corridor and state planning, for future high-speed rail services.</li>
</ul><p>For the High-Speed and Intercity Passenger Rail Program, FRA selected 153 projects across the country, with nearly 85 percent of rail investments concentrated in 6 corridors (San Francisco-Los Angeles, Boston-New York City-Washington, D.C., Seattle-Portland-Eugene, Charlotte-Washington, D.C., Chicago-St. Louis, and Chicago-Detroit). These corridors are in five mega-regions, in which about 65 percent of the U.S. population resides and which will likely absorb the bulk of future population growth.</p>
<p>FRA has developed a sophisticated grants management apparatus, laid the foundation for sustainable long-term passenger rail improvements, and strengthened industry capacity to deliver rail projects through technical assistance and strategic initiatives. FRA is strongly committed to robust stakeholder outreach, communication, and collaboration as central components of program management, allowing FRA to identify program improvements, engage in project planning and development, and provide the support necessary for grantees to carry out projects successfully.</p>

<p>The En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) System replaces the 40-year-old En Route HOST Computer System and backup system used at 20 FAA ARTCCs around the country.  ERAM is the main computer system air traffic controllers use to guide airplanes flying at high altitudes.  Air traffic control towers, terminal radar approach control facilities, the Air Traffic Control System Command Center, flight service stations, and other agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense, all connect to and use the information managed by the En Route HOST Computer System.  The original HOST computer software architecture was developed in the late 1960s and was implemented as National Airspace System (NAS) Stage A in the early 1970s.</p>
<p>For controllers, ERAM provides a user-friendly interface with customizable displays.  Trajectory modeling is more accurate than in HOST, allowing maximum airspace use, better conflict detection, and improved decision making.  ERAM will substantially increase the number of flights that can be tracked and displayed to controllers from 1,100 to 1,900.  The ERAM system also provides two functionally identical channels with dual redundancy, providing a more robust back-up capability than today's environment.  Coverage will also extend beyond facility boundaries, enabling controllers to handle additional traffic more efficiently because ERAM is designed to process data from up to 64 radars instead of the current 24.  The ERAM system is needed to replace the current HOST system and allow the FAA to continue to provide the high level of safe, reliable air traffic control services that the nation has come to expect; and also put in place the infrastructure necessary to transition the NAS to NextGen.</p>

For example, the average American adult between the ages of 25 and 54 drives over 12,700 miles per year and the average American household has to spend $7,658 annually to buy, maintain, and operate personal automobiles. Alternatives to auto travel are lacking in many communities. Fewer than one in 20 households are located within a half-mile of rail transit and only 53 percent of Americans have access to any form of public transportation service.  We will enhance the economic and social well-being of all Americans by creating and maintaining a reliable, integrated, and accessible transportation network that enhances choices for transportation users, provides easy access to employment opportunities and other destinations, and promotes positive effects on the surrounding community.</p>

The aviation industry has made significant gains in fuel efficiency, with commercial jet aircraft fuel efficiency improvements of 70 percent over the last 40 years. DOT and the EPA have worked closely with auto manufacturers, the State of California, environmental groups and other stakeholders to promulgate new rules and develop a series of programs to increase fuel economy for the Nation's vehicle fleet.  We will continue to promote the deployment of advanced vehicle technologies, alternatives fuels and alternatives fuels infrastructure where feasible to  reduce  energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of transportation systems, including highway vehicles, transit systems ships and airport support vehicles.</p>

<p>Reducing roadway fatalities continues to be a top priority at the Department of Transportation (DOT).  Roadway crashes are among the leading causes of death in the United States, especially among young people. In 2015, an estimated 35,200 people died on the Nation’s roadways and action must be taken to address this serious public health and safety problem.  The financial impact of roadway crashes also puts a significant burden on the Nation: approximately $871 billion per year in economic and societal losses underscores the magnitude of the problem.  Roadway crashes are one of the leading causes of traumatic brain injuries as well as permanent spinal cord injuries, putting a heavy burden on our medical systems.</p>
<p>The importance of improving transportation safety is reflected in DOT’s Strategic Plan. The Department strives to make the U.S. transportation system the safest in the world. DOT will work with all of its stakeholders — transportation agencies, elected officials, law enforcement, industry, safety advocates, novice drivers, the disability and older adult communities, and the public — to reduce transportation-related fatalities and injuries and make our roadway system safe for all users.</p>
<p>Progress toward a national roadway safety goal requires collaboration with a diverse group of stakeholders and partners across a range of disciplines.  Within DOT, the relevant operating administrations can leverage the respective resources and expertise to more effectively achieve a safer transportation environment. These organizations include the following:</p>
<ul><li>Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) provides Federal State and local partners the tools, resources, and information necessary to make sound safety investment decisions and coordinates with States to develop Strategic Highway Safety Plans (SHSP) and implement programs that improve the safety of roadway infrastructure on all public roads.</li>
<li>Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) promotes safe commercial motor vehicle (CMV) (large truck and bus) operations through education, innovation, regulation, enforcement, financial assistance, partnerships, and full accountability to reduce crashes, injuries, and fatalities on our Nation’s roadways involving CMVs.</li>
<li>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) develops vehicle safety standards, conducts research on new vehicle safety and technology, and oversees compliance, defect investigations and recalls.  NHTSA equally focuses on driver behavior by developing effective traffic safety programs, providing grant funds to States to implement these programs, and implementing national high visibility enforcement campaigns.</li>

</p>
                               <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>Background:</p>
<p>Reducing roadway fatalities continues to be a top priority at the Department of Transportation (DOT).  Roadway crashes are among the leading causes of death in the United States, especially among young people. Over the past 10 years, there has been a 25 percent reduction in the number of fatalities on the Nation’s roadways. In 2014, there were a projected 32,675 motor vehicle fatalities. This decline in fatalities shows a continuation in the general trend downward in fatalities that started in 2006.  In fact, the projected 2014 fatality rate of 1.08 per 100 vehicle million miles traveled (VMT) is the lowest ever recorded.</p>
<p>The importance of improving transportation safety is reflected in DOT’s Strategic Plan. The Department strives to make the U.S. transportation system the safest in the world. DOT will work with all of its stakeholders — transportation agencies, elected officials, law enforcement, industry, safety advocates, novice drivers, the disability and older adult communities, and the public — to reduce transportation-related fatalities and injuries and make our roadway system safe for all users.</p>
<p>Progress toward a national roadway safety goal requires collaboration with a diverse group of stakeholders and partners across a range of disciplines.  Within DOT, the relevant operating administrations can leverage the respective resources and expertise to more effectively achieve a safer transportation environment. These organizations include the following:</p>
<ul><li>Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) provides Federal State and local partners the tools, resources, and information necessary to make sound safety investment decisions and coordinates with States to develop Strategic Highway Safety Plans (SHSP) and implement programs that improve the safety of roadway infrastructure on all public roads.</li>
<li>Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) promotes safe commercial motor vehicle (CMV) (large truck and bus) operations through education, innovation, regulation, enforcement, financial assistance, partnerships, and full accountability to reduce crashes, injuries, and fatalities on our Nation’s roadways involving CMVs.</li>
<li>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) develops vehicle safety standards, conducts research on new vehicle safety and technology, and oversees compliance, defect investigations and recalls.  NHTSA equally focuses on driver behavior by developing effective traffic safety programs, providing grant funds to States to implement these programs, and implementing national high visibility enforcement campaigns.</li>
</ul><p>Roadway fatalities impact all road users, including drivers, passengers, pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclists, commercial vehicle operators, and those who work to build and maintain the Nation’s four million miles of roadways. The  Federal government is the only entity that has the authority to establish national safety standards for vehicles, regulate interstate motor carriers, and mandate roadway safety features.</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholders:</strong></p>
<p>FHWA, FMCSA, and NHTSA have formed strategic alliances with partners from a wide array of backgrounds to enhance and forward the Nation’s roadway safety agenda through guidance, technical assistance, and development of resource materials. Many stakeholders currently address transportation safety issues independently, through individual goals, plans, and activities. Some have implemented substantial safety initiatives, and these contributions are vital to maintaining and improving roadway safety. As described in the RSP, involvement by multiple stakeholders provides opportunities for broader public outreach and for the development and implementation of cross-cutting roadway safety strategies reflecting the common interests of many parties.</p>
<p>Each partner offers unique strengths and abilities to assist each mode to deliver its programs and leverage resources in protecting the public on the Nation’s roadways.  Progress toward a national roadway safety goal requires collaboration with a diverse group of stakeholders and partners across a range of disciplines.  The agencies within DOT work with a network of partner organizations, such as State Highway Safety Offices, State transportation departments, Tribal governments, local and county traffic engineers, law enforcement agencies, public health associations, safety advocacy groups, the motorcoach industry, hazardous shipping businesses, interstate trucking operations and the auto industry on the development of evidence-based roadway safety programs, projects, and safety standards.  Such collaboration will help to integrate a broad range of factors affecting roadway safety and create more efficient and effective problem-solving synergies across the transportation industry.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<p>A number of challenges could slow down or even reverse positive trends.  Many States continue to face budget shortfalls and are under tremendous pressure to reduce services, resulting in cut backs to roadway safety programs.  Cutbacks in State, Tribal and local law enforcement agency budgets could weaken national enforcement campaigns and local traffic safety enforcement efforts.  States, Tribes, and local governments must be willing to use data-driven analytical processes to make the best and most effective safety investments.</p>
<p>Distracted driving has emerged as a new threat over the past few years as the rise of portable electronic devices has swiftly expanded.   Moreover, as in-vehicle electronic systems become ever more sophisticated and complex, distracted driving could become an even greater threat if it is not addressed in a manner keeping pace with technological advancements.  In fact, a new report by the Governors' Highway Safety Association (GHSA) cites 50 percent of the US adult population now owning smartphones and the wireless industry reports a subscription penetration rate of 102.2 percent (^1).  Also, as the economy continues to gain momentum, more recreational travel and driving may lead to higher crash rates.  Additionally, safety defects in vehicles that are not addressed in a safe and efficiently manner can lead toward more serious vehicle crashes and injuries.  Finally, the repeal of proven life-saving traffic safety laws at the State level, such as universal motorcycle helmet or primary seat belt laws, could also result in higher injuries and fatalities.  Nevertheless, significant opportunities remain for continued progress in reducing roadway fatalities.  The Department will seek new and innovative ways to serve the American people and keep our roadways safe.</p>
<p>MAP-21, The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (P.L 112-141), was signed into law by President Obama on July 6, 2012.  MAP-21 provides an increase in safety funds available for the Highway Safety Improvement Program along with a focus on performance-based programming.  Implementation of MAP-21 will rely heavily on increased partnership across State agencies with DOT.  Additionally, the shift to performance-based programming may require additional effort on the part of some States.  There are also challenges associated with improving safety with local roads and local agencies with Federal-aid program funds, as well as the capacity and willingness of States to use data-driven and analytical processes to make the best safety infrastructure investments.</p>

By 2050, the U.S. population will likely increase by more than 100 million people. Highway and airport congestion are increasing, with related severe economic and environmental impacts. To address these challenges and strengthen the country’s competitive position in an increasingly global economy, the U.S. Department of Transportation has a comprehensive program to develop high-speed and intercity passenger rail. The Federal Railroad Administration manages an approximately $20 billion grant and loan portfolio focused on:</p>
<ul><li>Building new high-speed rail corridors that expand and fundamentally improve passenger transportation in the geographic regions they serve;</li>
<li>Upgrading existing intercity passenger rail corridors to improve reliability, speed, and frequency of existing services; and</li>
<li>Laying the groundwork, through corridor and state planning, for future high-speed rail services.</li>
</ul><p>For the High-Speed and Intercity Passenger Rail Program, FRA selected 153 projects across the country, with nearly 85 percent of rail investments concentrated in 6 corridors (San Francisco-Los Angeles, Boston-New York City-Washington, D.C., Seattle-Portland-Eugene, Charlotte-Washington, D.C., Chicago-St. Louis, and Chicago-Detroit). These corridors are in five mega-regions, in which about 65 percent of the U.S. population resides and which will likely absorb the bulk of future population growth.</p>
<p>FRA has developed a sophisticated grants management apparatus, laid the foundation for sustainable long-term passenger rail improvements, and strengthened industry capacity to deliver rail projects through technical assistance and strategic initiatives. FRA is strongly committed to robust stakeholder outreach, communication, and collaboration as central components of program management, allowing FRA to identify program improvements, engage in project planning and development, and provide the support necessary for grantees to carry out projects successfully.</p>

                               <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>Air traffic control systems can improve the efficiency of airspace. As of December 2014, ERAM achieved Initial Operation Capability at all 20 Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs).  By March 2015, all 20 Air Route Traffic Control Centers will have achieved Operational Readiness Date (ORD) for ERAM.</p>
<p>The En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) System replaces the 40-year-old En Route HOST Computer System and backup system used at 20 FAA ARTCCs around the country.  ERAM is the main computer system air traffic controllers use to guide airplanes flying at high altitudes.  Air traffic control towers, terminal radar approach control facilities, the Air Traffic Control System Command Center, flight service stations, and other agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense, all connect to and use the information managed by the En Route HOST Computer System.  The original HOST computer software architecture was developed in the late 1960s and was implemented as National Airspace System (NAS) Stage A in the early 1970s.</p>
<p>For controllers, ERAM provides a user-friendly interface with customizable displays.  Trajectory modeling is more accurate than in HOST, allowing maximum airspace use, better conflict detection, and improved decision making.  ERAM will substantially increase the number of flights that can be tracked and displayed to controllers from 1,100 to 1,900.  The ERAM system also provides two functionally identical channels with dual redundancy, providing a more robust back-up capability than today's environment.  Coverage will also extend beyond facility boundaries, enabling controllers to handle additional traffic more efficiently because ERAM is designed to process data from up to 64 radars instead of the current 24.  The ERAM system is needed to replace the current HOST system and allow the FAA to continue to provide the high level of safe, reliable air traffic control services that the nation has come to expect; and also put in place the infrastructure necessary to transition the NAS to NextGen.</p>
