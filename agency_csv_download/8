","The Priority Goals define the areas of notable reform set by the Secretary that were developed as part of the Department of he Interior's FY 2011 - 2016 Strategic Plan.  The Department's Strategic Plan provides the frameowrk for the programs and activities that are performed by nine bureaus and multiple offices, and that takes place at 2,400 locations throughout the Nation.  The plan was developed over the course of 18 months, including extensive consultation to incorporate lessons learned and reflect a more integrated, simpler, and focused presentation, including expanded consultation with Indian tribes.  Congressional consultations started with the review of the framework proposed for the Strategic Plan at the start of the development process to gather any particular points to consider and include, with a review of the completed product prior to its release.  Additional consideration of the Priority Goals was also conducted with review of the budget materials that were provided to COngress by the Department and the Executive Office.

The Priority Goal for ""Improved Oversight and Management of Oil and Gas Resources"" is a component of the Department's efforts to address the deficiencies identified in the GAO High Risk report, which identified the areas for needed improvement including:


	ensuring data on production verification and royalties are consistent and reliable,
	meeting goals for oil and gas verification inspections, and
	ensuring that informal employee training is supported by formalized training courses offered on a consistent basis.


Therefore consultations occur through GAO follow-up actions to ensure a coordinated interaction with Congress.
