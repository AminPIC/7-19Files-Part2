The Judiciary Act of 1789 created the Office of the Attorney General, providing for the appointment of “a person, learned in the law, to act as attorney-general for the United States.”  By 1870, the duties of the Office of the Attorney General had expanded so much that Congress adopted “An Act to establish the Department of Justice” with the Attorney General as its head.

 

The Department of Justice serves to prevent terrorism and promote the Nation's security consistent with the rule of law; prevent crime, protect the rights of the American people, and enforce federal law; and ensure and support the fair, impartial, efficient, and transparent administration of justice at the federal, state, local, tribal, and international levels.
