	Managing Federal finances;
	Collecting taxes, duties, and monies paid to and due to the United States and paying all bills of the United States;
	Producing currency and coinage;
	Managing Government accounts and the public debt;
	Supervising national banks and thrift institutions;
	Formulating domestic and international financial, monetary, economic, trade, and tax policies;
	Enforcing Federal finance and tax laws; and
	Investigating and prosecuting tax evaders and assisting in the investigation of counterfeiters and forgers.


Treasury works with other federal agencies, foreign governments, public stakeholders, and international financial institutions to encourage global economic growth, raise standards of living, and, to the extent possible, anticipate and mitigate the consequences of economic and financial crises.&amp;nbsp; The Treasury Department and its partners also perform a critical and far-reaching role in enhancing national security through financial and economic intelligence analysis, action, and oversight to identify and disrupt various threats and to protect the international financial system from abuse.
