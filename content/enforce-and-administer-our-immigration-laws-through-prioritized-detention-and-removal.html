            <div class="">
                <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is committed to identifying, arresting, detaining, prosecuting, and removing aliens who present a danger to national security or are a risk to public safety, as well as those who otherwise undermine the integrity of our immigration laws and our border control efforts.  These include, but are not limited to aliens engaged in or suspected of terrorism or espionage, violent criminals, felons and repeat offenders, and organized criminal gang members.  Also critical to ICE enforcement priorities are recent illegal border crossers.</p>
<p>This goal is a continuation of effort began in FY12 to increase efficiencies in the process of detaining and removing illegal aliens.  The focus for the next two years will be to showcase ICE’s abilities to remove criminal aliens from the United States.  These efforts include identifying and apprehending at-large criminal aliens, and expanding coverage in jails and prisons in order to identify and process removable incarcerated foreign-born detainees.</p>
<p>ICE uses prosecutorial discretion which improves efficiencies by identifying and eliminating low priority cases clogging the immigration system.  The use of prosecutorial discretion also allows ICE to prioritize the use of its enforcement personnel, detention space, and removal assets to ensure that the aliens it removes represent, as much as reasonably possible, the agency's enforcement priorities, namely the promotion of national security, border security, public safety, and the integrity of the immigration system.</p>

            <h2>Strategies</h2>
            <!--<div class="teaser collapsed">
                                            </div>-->
            <div class="">
                <p>ICE has put into place a number of strategies to target immigration enforcement resources on DHS priorities like threats to public safety or national security, including convicted criminals, recent border crossers, immigration fugitives, and repeat immigration law violators, including:</p>
<p>• Expansion of the Criminal Alien Program (CAP):</p>
<p>This program provides ICE-wide direction and support in the biometric and biographic identification, arrest, and removal of priority aliens who are incarcerated within federal, state, and local prisons and jails, as well as at-large criminal aliens that have circumvented identification. It is incumbent upon ICE to ensure that all efforts are made to investigate, arrest, and remove individuals from the United States that ICE deems priorities by processing the alien expeditiously and securing a final order of removal for an incarcerated alien before the alien is released to ICE custody.  The identification and processing of criminal aliens prior to release from incarceration decreases or eliminates the time spent in ICE custody and reduces the overall cost to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>• Expansion of the National Fugitive Operations Program (NFOP):</p>
<p>The NFOP identifies, locates, and arrests fugitive aliens, at-large criminal and previously removed aliens, focusing on public safety threats and violent criminal aliens.  The success of the NFOP’s integrated efforts requires analysis and cross-referencing of records; surveillance; investigative interviews; liaison with federal, state and local public safety agencies as well as foreign government representatives; administration of subpoenas; and execution of both administrative and criminal arrest warrants and has resulted in an overall decrease in the fugitive population and an increase in at-large criminal alien arrests.</p>
<p>• Utilizing Secure Communities to improve the ability of State and Local Law Enforcement in identifying criminals</p>
<p>This initiative uses an already-existing federal information-sharing partnership between ICE and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that helps to identify criminal aliens without imposing new or additional requirements on state and local law enforcement. For decades, local jurisdictions have shared the fingerprints of individuals who are arrested or booked into custody with the FBI to see if they have a criminal record. Under Secure Communities, the FBI automatically sends the fingerprints to DHS to check against its immigration databases. If these checks reveal that an individual is unlawfully present in the United States or otherwise removable due to a criminal conviction, ICE takes enforcement action – prioritizing the removal of individuals who present the most significant threats to public safety as determined by the severity of their current crime, their criminal history, and other factors – as well as those who have repeatedly violated immigration laws.</p>
<p>• Enhance the use of Prosecutorial Discretion to resolve detention and removal cases.</p>
<p>ICE has limited resources to support its responsibility to enforce the nation's civil immigration laws.  Like any other law enforcement agency, ICE has prosecutorial discretion and may exercise it within the course of ordinary enforcement.  Initiatives such as the case-by-case review, where ICE reviewed over 300,000 cases in the immigration court docket backlog, help improve efficiencies by identifying and eliminating low priority cases that are clogging the system. These initiatives ensure that the agency’s immigration enforcement resources are focused on priorities, including the identification, arrest, and removal of convicted criminal aliens.</p>
<p>• Reduce the cost of detention through effective detention bed management that focuses on high priority individuals.</p>
<p>ICE is working to reduce the cost of detention, while maintaining PBNDS.  These reductions are taking place while ensuring transparency and accountability through effective management of resources, including number of beds that are available for detainees, strong financial oversight and a review of detention procurement in the field. These measures will enable ICE to identify opportunities to reduce costs while ensuring consistent practices. For instance, in an effort to better allocate resources, ICE has implemented revised acquisition strategies, facility consolidation and realignments, and contract review initiatives.</p>
<p>To improve its acquisition strategy, ICE is utilizing a combination of federal acquisition regulation -based contracts and federal government-to-state/county/local-government Inter-Governmental Service Agreements (IGSAs) which provide more operational flexibility and can be extended by mutual agreement or terminated by either party at any time after proper notice is given.</p>
<p>ICE has reduced excess capacity in the detention system by optimizing the utilization of detention facilities. The geographical alignment of detention capacity with operational demand will significantly reduce the number of detainee transfers and result in decreased costs associated with detainee transportation and delays in detainee legal proceedings.</p>

            <h2>Progress Update</h2>
            <div>
                <p>In November of 2014, Secretary of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson, issued the memorandum Policies for the Apprehension, Detention and Removal of Undocumented Immigrants, outlining the Department’s revised civil enforcement priorities (CEP). The memorandum directs that the nation’s limited immigration enforcement resources be used in the most effective and efficient way possible, focusing on the removal of the greatest threats to national security, public safety, and border security. The revised civil enforcement priorities strengthen the Department’s focus on recent border crossers and serious criminals. Successful execution of the Secretary’s memorandum was supported by the following contributing programs in FY 2015:</p>
<p>Enforcement:<br />
• ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) continued to utilize the Criminal Alien Program Surge Enforcement Team (CAPSET), which is capable of deploying to areas needing additional assistance. ERO completed four CAPSET operations specifically targeting facilities with a high population of detainees scheduled to be released in November 2015 pursuant to the 2014 United States Sentencing Commission Amendment 782.  These operations resulted in 777 encounters, 247 detainers, 161 charging documents issued, and 55 arrests.  <br />
• ICE continues to expand the Criminal History Information Sharing (CHIS) program, allowing ERO to share information regarding the criminal convictions of foreign nationals being removed from the U.S. and to receive information about foreign criminal convictions for individuals in ICE custody. In FY 2015, ERO concluded negotiations with Jamaica and the Bahamas, and official CHIS agreements are expected to be signed in FY 2016.<br />
• Fugitive Operations Teams made 20,961 arrests, approximately 89% of which were criminal arrests, the highest percentage in the program’s history.</p>
<p>• ICE continued National Criminal Analysis and Targeting Center support to the Sex Offender Registration initiative to identify, target, and remove foreign-born sex offenders, leading to 55 arrests in FY 2015.</p>
<p>Detention:<br />
• In FY 2015, nearly 99% of ICE detainees were subject to mandatory detention or otherwise met an enforcement priority.<br />
• The Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program continued to provide monitoring of non-detained criminal aliens and increased the average daily population by approximately 3,625 from FY 2014 (approximately 23,000) to FY 2015 (approximately 26,600).<br />
• The ATD program developed and implemented numerous staging areas (S sites) that allow for initial ATD evaluation and enrollment of individuals before they are released from Border Patrol facilities or Family Residential Centers.  ICE assigns a GPS unit to such individuals, and allows them to transit across the U.S. to their final destination in the appropriate AOR, where their status in the program will then be further evaluated.  The S sites enable oversight of those individuals in transit, where previously they were not monitored unless and until they reported in at their final destination.  ICE enrolled 6,308 participants on the southwest border and over 2,099 participants at the three Family Residential Centers.<br />
Removal:<br />
• ERO established a process with the government of El Salvador to acquire travel documents in order to advance Failure to Comply (FTC) removal cases.  FTC cases are those comparatively small number of cases where ICE has been unable to obtain the necessary travel documents to effectuate repatriation of an individual in its custody.  This resulted in the removal of over 50 FTC cases in FY 2015.<br />
• On March 27, 2015, ICE ERO signed a MOU with the People’s Republic of China facilitating the travel of Chinese experts to the U.S. to verify the identity and citizenship of Chinese nationals who are under final removal orders.  Chinese officials have already interviewed 82 such individuals, and verified the Chinese citizenship of 30 of them.  These individuals are now awaiting removal.  The remaining cases are ongoing.<br />
• On September 4, 2015, ERO established a process to obtain birth certificates from the Government of Jamaica for individuals who are subject to a final order of removal. </p>
<p>Challenges:<br />
In FY 2015, many of ICE’s performance outcomes were negatively impacted by laws and policies in jurisdictions across the country that limit state and local law enforcement cooperation with ICE detainers, and federal court precedent that has resulted in the release of a greater number of criminal aliens on bonds and their placement on the slower, non-detained docket.  Consistent with Secretary Johnson’s November 2014 memorandum Secure Communities, ICE is working with state and local jurisdictions to increase cooperation through requests for notification of certain priority aliens prior to the alien’s release in order to mitigate the impact of detainer non-compliance. </p>

Given ATEP changes ERO projects criminal removals will be lower than in FY 2013.  Also, criminal removals experienced in the past 5 fiscal years can be largely attributed to the deployment of Secure Communities' Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT)/Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS) interoperability, where an influx of enforceable aliens was brought under ICE’s purview. This influx due to initial deployment created a backlog of removable aliens, which has been significantly reduced. Therefore, meeting or exceeding prior year criminal removals is not likely.</p>

Between FY 2012 and FY 2013, ICE experienced a decrease in criminal removals from 225,390 to 216,810, partly due to operational changes to the Alien Transfer Exit Program (ATEP).  In FY 2014, the first full year in which ATEP has not been operational, criminal removals further decreased.  Notably, however, CBP Border Patrol supported ICE’s reduction in ATEP transportation resources by removing or voluntarily returning those individuals who would have met the criteria for ATEP.</p>
<p>Additionally, state and local laws, executive orders, and policies in hundreds of jurisdictions have limited the ability of local law enforcement to cooperate with ICE detainers, which has significantly impacted state and local removal operations.  Between January 1, 2014 and September 30, 2014, ICE recorded 10,121 instances of detainers that were not honored by local jurisdictions. When this happens, ICE must dedicate additional officer resources to locate and arrest criminal aliens in the public domain, resulting in additional time, effort, human resources, and officer and public safety risks.</p>

<p>(1) Decline in Border Patrol (BP) turnovers.  BP turnovers are aliens apprehended by BP who are turned over to ICE for detention. There were approximately 47,000 BP turnovers in FY15 Q1, as compared to 54,000 in FY14 Q1.  This is significant – BP turnovers accounted for 68% of total removals in FY14.</p>
<p>(2) State and local laws, executive orders, and policies in hundreds of jurisdictions have limited the ability of local law enforcement to cooperate with ICE detainers, which has significantly impacted state and local removal operations.  Between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2014, ICE recorded 12,175 instances of detainers that were not honored by local jurisdictions – 1,993 such instances occurred in FY15 Q1.  When this happens, ICE must dedicate additional officer resources to locate and arrest criminal aliens in the public domain, resulting in additional time, effort, human resources, and officer and public safety risks; and</p>
<p>(3) Federal court decisions, including the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>mandate that individuals, who are detained while in removal proceedings, must be granted individual bond hearings within 180 days of the commencement of immigration detention, regardless of ICE’s custody determination.  <em>Rodriguez </em>applies throughout the Ninth Circuit, the largest federal jurisdiction.  As a result, a greater number of individuals have been released on immigration judge-determined bonds and transferred from the detained docket to the non-detained docket.  Cases on the non-detained docket take longer to adjudicate and require additional ICE resources.  Comparing FY15 to FY14, the affected Areas of Responsibility (AORs) experienced a 41% drop in criminal removals in the first quarter.</p>

• Policies in jurisdictions across the country that have limited state and local law enforcement cooperation with ICE detainers.  Between January 1, 2014 and September 13, 2015, ICE recorded 18,499 instances when local jurisdictions declined ICE detainers.  When this happens, ICE must dedicate additional officer resources to locate and arrest criminal aliens in the public domain, increasing processing times, agent hours, and risk to both officers and the public.<br />
• A decrease in Border Patrol turnovers by 26% from FY 2014 to FY 2015. Roughly one quarter of border patrol turnovers are convicted ~~criminals, meaning that there were 12,000 fewer convicted criminal turnovers to ICE in FY 2015 than FY 2014.<br />
• Federal court decisions, including the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Rodriguez v. Robbins, which mandate that individuals who are detained while in removal proceedings, must be granted individual bond hearings at 180 days, even if subject to mandatory detention by law. Rodriguez applies throughout the Ninth Circuit, the largest federal jurisdiction.  As a result, a greater number of individuals have been released on immigration judge-determined bonds and transferred from the detained docket to the non-detained docket.  Cases on the non-detained docket take longer to adjudicate and require additional ICE resources.  Comparing FY2015 to FY2014, the affected Areas of Responsibility (AORs) experienced an approximate 30% drop in criminal removals.</p>

In FY13, ICE removed 2,455 Level 1 criminal aliens through ATEP. Also, criminal removals experienced in the past 5 fiscal years can be largely attributed to the deployment of Secure Communities' Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT)/Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS) interoperability, where an influx of enforceable aliens was brought under ICE’s purview. This influx due to initial deployment created a backlog of removable aliens, which has been significantly reduced. Therefore, meeting or exceeding prior year criminal removals is not likely.</p>

ICE removed 2,455 Level 1 criminal aliens through the Alien Transfer Exit Program (ATEP) in FY13. Operational changes to ATEP midway through FY13 continues to affect Level 1 removals, and ICE projects less criminal removals in FY14 than in previous years.     Also, the FY14 target of 86,000 removals is a 16% increase in L1 removals from the FY13 result of 74,159. ICE is limited to the total available Level 1 criminal aliens released from prison and the identifiable population at large. While it is unlikely ICE will meet the Level 1 criminal removal target, as a result of prioritizing enforcement efforts on the most dangerous offenders, ICE will likely surpass FY13's percentage of L1 Removals to Total Removals.</p>

<p>Level 1 criminal alien removals were similarly impacted by the operational and policy changes described above: (1) changes to the ATEP program which was responsible for 2,455 Level 1 criminal alien removals in FY 2013; and (2) state and local laws, executive orders, and policies in hundreds of jurisdictions limiting cooperation with ICE detainers.  As discussed above, CBP Border Patrol supported ICE’s reduction in ATEP transportation resources by removing or voluntarily returning those individuals who would have met the criteria for ATEP.</p>

The increased Average Length of Stay (ALOS) is due to changes in the way ICE supports the Alien Transfer Exit Program (ATEP). In FY13 (until June 3, 2013), ATEP was responsible for 14,632 criminal removals with an ALOS of 1.6 days. Thus by removing ATEP cases, ICE can expect ALOS to rise. Despite Q1's underperformance, ERO believes target achievement is possible by year's end.  Criminal ALOS has historically demonstrated a quarter-to-quarter downward seasonal trend.  Applying the average decrease by quarter (from FY10-FY13) to current ALOS, we forecast Criminal ALOS in proximity to 34.5 days. ERO also continues to work with DOJ to develop initiatives (e.g. Video Teleconference hearings) to expedite the removal process with full regard to ensuring detainee access to family, healthcare, legal assistance, etc. as well as analyzing detention capacity and travel routes to limit transfers which increases ALOS (as well as affecting alien access to their support network).</p>

As of March 31, 2014, criminal ALOS is 2.6 days higher compared to criminal ALOS as of March 31, 2013.

In FY13 (until June 3, 2013 when ATEP was changed), ATEP was responsible for 14,632 criminal removals with an ALOS of 1.6 days. Thus by removing ATEP cases, ICE can expect ALOS to rise. Through Q2 FY 2014, the ALOS in the 9th Circuit has increased approximately 30% as compared to FY 2013. While ICE is unlikely to meet the 34.5 day target, ICE believes the 36.5 day EOY forecast is achievable, (despite Q2's underperformance by over 4 days) since Criminal ALOS has historically demonstrated a quarter-to-quarter downward seasonal trend.  Applying the average decrease by quarter (from FY09-FY13) to current ALOS, we forecast Criminal ALOS in proximity to 36.5 days.

By eliminating ATEP cases, ALOS rose. The FY 2013 ALOS for convicted criminals who were not part of the ATEP program was 35.9 days.  As discussed above,</p>
<p>CBP Border Patrol supported ICE’s reduction in ATEP transportation resources by removing or voluntarily returning those individuals who would have met the criteria for ATEP.</p>
<p>Additionally FY 2014 ended with 645 more convicted criminal credible fear cases than FY 2013, an increase of 18%.  A convicted criminal credible fear case through FY 2014 has an ALOS of 75.9 days, which has contributed to the increased convicted criminal ALOS.</p>
<p>In mid-FY 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit mandated that all aliens detained by ICE in the Ninth Circuit’s jurisdiction should be afforded bond hearings if they have remained in custody 180 days or more (<em>see Rodriguez v. Robbins</em>). ICE ERO calculated that the ALOS for the likely affected group, those who require both a final order of removal and travel documents in the Ninth Circuit (51,098 people), has increased by 20% between FY 2013 (45.4 days) and FY 2014 (54.6 days).</p>

                                        <td><p>In FY2015 Q3, convicted criminal alien average length of stay (ALOS) was 40.8 days.</p>
<p>The ALOS has been influenced by an overall decrease of book-outs nationwide.  While the share of book-outs in jurisdictions like Houston and Phoenix increased in FY 2015 Q3 as compared to this time last year, such increases have been outpaced by the decreasing share of book-outs in regions like California and New York over the same period.  This had resulted in fewer book-outs in the aggregate, which in turn has resulted in an increased ALOS as compared to this time last year.</p>
<p>The most significant ALOS increases occurred in AORs falling within the jurisdiction of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit due in significant part to <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Robbins</em>.  Comparing FY14 Q3 and FY15 Q3, the affected AORs have seen a 6.2 day (or 16%) increase in ALOS of convicted criminal aliens (37.8 to 44.0 days) in the third quarter.  For comparison, all AORs combined experienced an increase of just 3.2 days (or 8%).</p>
<p>The increased ALOS is also likely associated with changes to the Alien Transfer Program (ATEP).  In FY 2014, the first full year in which ATEP had not been operational, criminal alien ALOS was 4.0 days (37.5 days) higher compared to criminal alien ALOS in FY 2013 (33.5 days).  In FY 2013 (until June 3, 2013 when changes to the ATEP took place), ATEP was responsible for 14,632 criminal removals with an ALOS of 1.6 days.  The ALOS rose after ATEP cases were eliminated.  The FY 2013 ALOS for convicted criminals who were not part of the ATEP program was 35.9 days.</p>

<p>~~period there was substantial variation across Areas of Responsibility (AORs). For example, in the Ninth Circuit AOR, ALOS for convicted criminal aliens increased 12%, from 39 days in FY 2014 to 44 days in FY 2015. Within this group, the San Diego AOR experienced the largest criminal ALOS increase – 20 days – from 43 days in FY 2014 to 63 days in FY 2015.  These increases are a direct result of class action litigation that provide detained criminals incentives to remain in custody longer, such as Rodriguez v. Robbins in the Ninth Circuit, which granted criminal aliens bond hearings after six months of detention.</p>
<p>Criminal ALOS increased most as a result of delays in formal hearings for aliens who went through such proceedings.  ALOS for these individuals increased by 10 days (16%), from 64.4 days in FY 2014 to 75.0 days in FY 2015. . This jump coincided with the increased number of cases on the immigration court’s docket following the influx of migrants apprehended on the Southwest Border in 2014, and the corresponding prioritization of UAC and family unit cases on the docket.  .  This potentially resulted in delays in immigration hearings for convicted criminal alien single adults. In FY 2014 and FY 2015, UACs and family units made up 23% and 20%, respectively, of all hearings, compared to only 4% in FY 2013, the same year that criminal alien ALOS was only 33.5 days.</p>

<p>(1) A drop in Border Patrol (BP) turnovers. BP turnovers are aliens apprehended by BP who are turned over to ICE for detention.

<p>(2) State and local laws, and policies in hundreds of jurisdictions limiting cooperation with ICE detainers. When this happens, ICE must dedicate additional officer resources to locate and arrest criminal aliens in the public domain, resulting in additional time, effort, human resources, and officer and public safety risks.  This has resulted in fewer removal orders supporting the agency’s CEPs; and</p>
<p>(3) Federal court precedent, leading to a greater number of individuals released on immigration judge-determined bonds and transferred from the detained docket to the non-detained docket.

<p>(1) A drop in Border Patrol (BP) turnovers. BP turnovers are aliens apprehended by BP who are turned over to ICE for detention. BP turnovers would reflect recent border entrants, which is one of the CEPs. This is significant as removals from BP turnovers dropped by 20% from FY14 Q3  to FY15 Q3;</p>

<p>(3) Federal court precedent interpreting ICE’s detention authority and requiring bond hearings.  Holding additional bond hearings leads to a greater number of individuals released on immigration judge-determined bonds and transferred from the detained docket to the non-detained docket. Cases on the non-detained docket take longer to adjudicate and require additional ICE resources;</p>
<p>(4) Federal court precedent limiting when ICE can initiate removal proceedings against criminal aliens.  When an individual is convicted pursuant to a state statute, if the state statute is broader than its federal counterpart, with limited exception, ICE can only consider the language of the state statute to determine whether the criminal alien is subject to removal.  Because the underlying facts cannot be considered, removal proceedings cannot be initiated.</p>

• Border Patrol turnovers were down 26%.  Border Patrol turnovers include recent border entrants, which is one of the CEP categories.<br />
• At the same time, the processing required for Family Unit (FAMU) and Unaccompanied Children (UC) cases has led to delays between the apprehension date and the date of the issuance of a final order.  This also potentially impacts ICE’s quarterly outcomes. <br />
• Policies in jurisdictions across the country reducing state and local cooperation with ICE have led to the apprehension of fewer criminal aliens. <br />
• On April 13th, 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Rodriguez v. Robbins) granted criminal aliens bond hearings before an immigration judge, leading to the release of a greater number of aliens and the transfer of cases from the detained docket to the non-detained docket. Cases on the non-detained docket take longer to adjudicate and have resulted in a reduction in criminal removal orders for the reporting period.<br />

                <div>
                    <p>Current estimates puts the total unauthorized alien population in the U.S. at approximately 12 million, however public safety &amp; resource limitations drive ICE to focus on a subset of that population.  ICE’s APG reflects that targeted focus and has four programs that contribute to it:  Criminal Alien Program (CAP); Fugitive Operations Program Teams (FOT); 287(g); &amp; Secure Communities (SC).  ICE officers comprise CAP &amp; FOTs, and while CAP’s main focus is the screening of incarcerated aliens &amp; FOTs track down at-large criminals, those efforts are sometimes coordinated based on threats.  287(g) allows local law enforcement agents (LEA) to supplement ICE officers by permiting the LEA to function in a similar capacity as CAP officers, identifying and processing all criminal and other priority aliens arrested and booked into a detention facility.  In contrast to the first three programs that perform physical identification &amp; removal of criminal aliens, SC provides electronic identification of criminal aliens when booked in by an LEA for non-immigration related offenses.  Only through follow up by CAP, FOT, or 287(g) can a removal process be initiated.  Though different in composition and execution, all four programs are critical to meeting ICE’s APG.</p>

                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Statement:<span class="acc_content_label"><p>Enforce and administer our immigration laws through prioritized detention and removal of criminal aliens.  By September 30, 2015, ICE will increase criminal alien removals, as a percentage of total removals by 5%.</p>
</p>
                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:<span class="acc_content_label"><p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is committed to identifying, arresting, detaining, prosecuting, and removing aliens who present a danger to national security or are a risk to public safety, as well as those who otherwise undermine the integrity of our immigration laws and our border control efforts.  These include, but are not limited to aliens engaged in or suspected of terrorism or espionage, violent criminals, felons and repeat offenders, and organized criminal gang members.  Also critical to ICE enforcement priorities are recent illegal border crossers.</p>
<p>This goal is a continuation of effort began in FY12 to increase efficiencies in the process of detaining and removing illegal aliens.  The focus for the next two years will be to showcase ICE’s abilities to remove criminal aliens from the United States.  These efforts include identifying and apprehending at-large criminal aliens, and expanding coverage in jails and prisons in order to identify and process removable incarcerated foreign-born detainees.</p>
<p>ICE uses prosecutorial discretion which improves efficiencies by identifying and eliminating low priority cases clogging the immigration system.  The use of prosecutorial discretion also allows ICE to prioritize the use of its enforcement personnel, detention space, and removal assets to ensure that the aliens it removes represent, as much as reasonably possible, the agency's enforcement priorities, namely the promotion of national security, border security, public safety, and the integrity of the immigration system.</p>
