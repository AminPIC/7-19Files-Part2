                <p><em>Summary</em>:</p>
<p>Numerous programs provide a broad spectrum of benefits and support services that assist Veterans and eligible beneficiaries. To enable Veterans and eligible beneficiaries to choose the best benefits and services for their needs, VA will improve coordination between our programs, leverage supportive interactions between programs, and reduce overlap across programs. Success will be measured by the differences made in the lives of the Veterans we serve, including decreasing Veteran unemployment, decreasing home foreclosures, decreasing homelessness, reducing processing times for disability compensation claims, increasing preventive care and healthy lifestyle changes, and increasing access to and utilization of virtual care modalities.</p>
<p><em>Strategies</em>:</p>
<p>VA will eliminate Veteran homelessness by the end of FY 2015. VA, in collaboration with its Federal partners, will continue to provide rehabilitation services for homeless and at-risk Veterans, including employment assistance, access to permanent and transitional housing, and other supportive services. As the number of homeless Veterans continues to decline, the focus will shift from rescue to prevention.</p>
<p>VA will improve Veteran career readiness to reduce Veteran unemployment. We will synchronize and align Veteran employment programs managed by VA, and improve coordination across the various Federal Veteran employment initiatives. We will increase support to our Veterans with disabilities and those who are GI Bill eligible through programs offering educational and vocational counseling. VA will increase support to Veteran entrepreneurs through public-private partnerships to provide capacity building and by providing access to Federal contracting opportunities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>VA will provide Veterans and eligible beneficiaries with personalized, proactive, patient-driven health care to optimize health and well-being, while providing state-of-the-art disease management. VA’s Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACT) will ensure patient engagement in self-care, preventive services, primary care, and mental health services. PACT is a partnership between the Veteran and the health care team with an emphasis on prevention, health promotion, and self-management. PACTs use a team-based approach, with various members of the team stepping in at different points in time to provide needed care. We will expand and refine, in coordination with DoD, research into the long-term consequences of TBI and PTSD. VA will increasingly seek to understand underlying health, injury and disorder mechanisms to create evidence-based diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation methods for Veterans and eligible beneficiaries with support from their families.</p>

                      <p><strong>Final Assessment</strong><strong>:  </strong>VA, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, determined that performance toward this objective is making noteworthy progress.</p>
<p><strong>Achievements</strong><strong>:  </strong>In FY 2015, VA placed an estimate of 64,902 Veterans in permanent housing, including moves into the HUD-VASH<a href="improve-veteran-wellness-and-economic-security.html#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a> Program, rapid rehousing placements through SSVF<a href="improve-veteran-wellness-and-economic-security.html#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="" id="_ftnref2"><sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup></a> program, and moves from VA residential treatment programs into permanent housing. VA also moved 87 percent of unsheltered Veterans out of unsheltered status within 30 days of engagement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>VA continues to expand research through various initiatives.  Over 518,000 Veterans have agreed to participate in the Million Veteran Program<a href="improve-veteran-wellness-and-economic-security.html#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="" id="_ftnref3"><sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup></a> since May 5, 2011, (goal is to study how genes affect health) and over 425,000 Veterans have completed the enrollment process as<br />
of November 2015.  Genotype information on about 400,000 will be completed by December 2015.  Initial phenotyping alpha and beta-tests are underway. Also, discussions with DoD have resulted in VA-funded researchers working on-site at the Millennium Cohort Study<a href="improve-veteran-wellness-and-economic-security.html#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="" id="_ftnref4"><sup><sup>[4]</sup></sup></a> at the Naval Health Research Center in San Diego.  These researchers are studying issues that are of interest to VA, and may in the future provide critical information towards enhancing the long-term health of Veterans and future generations of military members. </p>

<p>VA improved Veteran economic security through the VetSuccess On Campus (VSOC)<a href="improve-veteran-wellness-and-economic-security.html#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="" id="_ftnref5"><sup><sup>[5]</sup></sup></a> program, which helps Veterans and dependents succeed with on-campus assistance and counseling.  There are currently 74 VSOC counselors at 147 campuses, with the potential to support a population of nearly 137,758 Veterans, Servicemembers, and eligible dependents.  VSOC counselors provide support in transition to campus life, and work with Veterans to enable their education and employment success.  Also, the GI Bill Comparison Tool<a href="improve-veteran-wellness-and-economic-security.html#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="" id="_ftnref6"><sup><sup>[6]</sup></sup></a> was launched and enhanced in FY 2014, in response to Executive Order 13607.  As of November 10, 2015, there were 1,304,606 unique page views of the Comparison Tool with over one million schools searched.  Employers are reporting over 348,000 positions filled toward their Veteran hiring commitments.  Since inception in April 2014, the Veterans Employment Center (VEC)<sup><sup><a href="improve-veteran-wellness-and-economic-security.html#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="" id="_ftnref7">[7]</a> </sup></sup>received more than 18 million page-views and features 2.2 million jobs.  It contains over 15,000 publicly posted job seeker profiles and over 1,100 committed employers.  Implementation of Veterans Economic Communities Initiative<a href="improve-veteran-wellness-and-economic-security.html#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="" id="_ftnref8"><sup><sup>[8]</sup></sup></a>, a phased initiative to provide enhanced economic opportunities for Veterans and their families.  On May 18, 2015, Phase 1 of the initiative rolled out to 25 U.S. communities evaluating success across 5 strategic focus areas:  Employment, Education, Partnerships, Local Policy Academies, and Integration with Government.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also, VA is implementing the Veteran’s Choice Program through the use of Third Party Administrators to provide care to Veterans.<a href="improve-veteran-wellness-and-economic-security.html#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="" id="_ftnref9"><sup><sup>[9]</sup></sup></a><sup>.</sup> In order to increase the number of Veterans who can use Choice, VA issued the “Hierarchy of Care” Memo to the field which makes Choice the top option for the VA Community, implemented the Choice First Program which offers Choice when a local facility does not offer service, and expanded “undue burden” to allow more flexibility where medical or distance challenges exist.  VA also utilized strategic communications to help Veterans, providers, and staff understand the Veterans Choice Program.  VA instituted a user-friendly site, set up a Veterans Choice Google Hangout, sent Home Mailers to Veterans and created a mandatory training program for staff on VA’s Talent Management System. Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACT) continue to transform “Veterans' care by providing patient-driven, proactive, personalized, team-based care oriented toward wellness and disease prevention resulting in improvements in Veteran satisfaction, improved healthcare outcomes and costs.”<a href="improve-veteran-wellness-and-economic-security.html#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="" id="_ftnref10"><sup><sup>[10]</sup></sup></a> The Prevention Index V scores, which indicate how well VA promotes healthy lifestyle, have been positively trending from FY 2010.  In FY 2015, the “maintain or exceed Prevention Index V” score is 92 percent.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Furthermore, VA continues to conduct internal and external outreach events that directly connect Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) and Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB) owners with Procurement Decision Makers from VA and other Federal and state agencies and corporations with Small Business needs to ensure procurement ready Small Businesses, particularly VOSBs, have access to relevant contracting opportunities.  Over 3,900 VOSBs participated in an outreach event during FY 2015.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong>: There are some challenges in achieving Objective 1.1. Community help is needed to provide affordable housing options for Veterans, opportunities for meaningful and sustainable employment, and improved access to mainstream programs and services (Homelessness APG).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also, major shifts in VA’s contracting mix, mostly involving new dollars for non-VA health care, as well as dollars transferred within VA for completion of the Denver replacement hospital, will make VA’s current small business goal percentages unachievable, even as the number of actual dollars awarded increases for SDVOSBs and VOSBs.  The percentage changes will give the appearance of a reduction in effort on small business goals, even though at its current pace VA is on-track to award more than $4 billion to VOSBs for the first time ever.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Changes to VA contract policy around liquidated-damages clauses will require an additional $20M in FY 2016 for the VALERI initiative, which enables Loan Guaranty Program’s success in assisting defaulted borrowers avoid foreclosure.  VBA leadership will work to identify funding as needed in FY 2016. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although the prevention index continues to reflect VHA PACT focus on population management, health promotion and disease management, the metric should be recognized as one of sustainment of VHA’s excellence in care delivery.  It is unlikely that this metric will demonstrate significant improvement over time, mainly due to  the Veterans preference to refuse screenings or vaccinations.  The data demonstrate a flat trend over time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Additionally, Intramural Research Sharing Opportunities between VA, DoD, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the National Institutes of Health are limited and do not allow intramural investigators to work seamlessly across agencies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>VA is experiencing issues communicating to all staff on the Veterans Choice Program and the mitigation plan is to institute mandatory training.  Another challenge is Veteran awareness, knowledge, education, and utilization of the Veterans Choice Program.</p>

                      <p><em>Summary</em>:</p>
<p>Numerous programs provide a broad spectrum of benefits and support services that assist Veterans and eligible beneficiaries. To enable Veterans and eligible beneficiaries to choose the best benefits and services for their needs, VA will improve coordination between our programs, leverage supportive interactions between programs, and reduce overlap across programs. Success will be measured by the differences made in the lives of the Veterans we serve, including decreasing Veteran unemployment, decreasing home foreclosures, decreasing homelessness, reducing processing times for disability compensation claims, increasing preventive care and healthy lifestyle changes, and increasing access to and utilization of virtual care modalities.</p>
<p><em>Strategies</em>:</p>
<p>VA will eliminate Veteran homelessness by the end of FY 2015. VA, in collaboration with its Federal partners, will continue to provide rehabilitation services for homeless and at-risk Veterans, including employment assistance, access to permanent and transitional housing, and other supportive services. As the number of homeless Veterans continues to decline, the focus will shift from rescue to prevention.</p>
<p>VA will improve Veteran career readiness to reduce Veteran unemployment. We will synchronize and align Veteran employment programs managed by VA, and improve coordination across the various Federal Veteran employment initiatives. We will increase support to our Veterans with disabilities and those who are GI Bill eligible through programs offering educational and vocational counseling. VA will increase support to Veteran entrepreneurs through public-private partnerships to provide capacity building and by providing access to Federal contracting opportunities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>VA will provide Veterans and eligible beneficiaries with personalized, proactive, patient-driven health care to optimize health and well-being, while providing state-of-the-art disease management. VA’s Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACT) will ensure patient engagement in self-care, preventive services, primary care, and mental health services. PACT is a partnership between the Veteran and the health care team with an emphasis on prevention, health promotion, and self-management. PACTs use a team-based approach, with various members of the team stepping in at different points in time to provide needed care. We will expand and refine, in coordination with DoD, research into the long-term consequences of TBI and PTSD. VA will increasingly seek to understand underlying health, injury and disorder mechanisms to create evidence-based diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation methods for Veterans and eligible beneficiaries with support from their families.</p>

On a single night in January 2014 during the Point in Time (PIT) Count <a href="http://c/Users/epbdmb/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.IE5/11GKRUOW/Homelessness%20APG%20(Feb_2014_Final_Update)%20kwh.docx#_ftn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, there were 49,933 homeless Veterans in the US.  Effectively ending homelessness among Veterans requires rapid access to permanent housing, health care, employment, benefits, and other supportive services.  VA works closely with community partners to meet current and new demands for any Veteran who is experiencing or is at imminent risk of homelessness.  Housing First and Rapid Re-housing are two of the many evidence-based approaches VA uses to end homelessness.  The Housing First model follows the philosophy of providing permanent housing as quickly as possible to Veterans/individuals experiencing homelessness and then wrapping health care and other supportive services as needed around the Veteran to sustain housing and improve their quality of life.  Rapid Re-housing is a set of strategies to help families quickly move out of homelessness and into permanent housing.  It typically involves:  housing search and landlord mediation assistance, short-term or flexible rental assistance, and transitional case management services.  Rapid Re-housing provides crisis intervention services to quickly place an individual or family who is currently homeless into a permanent, sustainable housing situation.</p>

<p>VA is a customer service organization. Complicated application processes, long processing timelines or difficulties getting information and appointments all impact the client’s experience and satisfaction. Veterans and eligible beneficiaries deserve a support system that is responsive to their needs. VA must keep pace with Veterans’ expectations and transform its customer services – soliciting regular customer feedback, streamlining processes, and delivering consistent service across customer-preferred channels.</p>
<p>We live in a connected world. The rapid pace of technological advancement is reshaping Veterans’ expectations regarding how services, benefits, and support should be delivered. Today’s client expects instant access to information and self-service options via the Internet, and increasingly through mobile devices like tablets and smartphones (and the next generation “smart” devices that are yet to be deployed).</p>
<p>To provide a personalized experience, we must listen, learn, and understand the needs and expectations of those we serve. We must have the knowledge, information and insight to understand why some choose not to fully engage with VA.</p>
<p><em>Strategies</em>:</p>
<p>VA will provide timely, accurate decisions on Veterans’ disability claims and eliminate the claims backlog. We will then implement a robust plan, and revisit procedures to ensure claims are addressed in no more than 125 days with at least 98 percent accuracy. The plan includes redesigning policies and procedures, continuing to enhance training for claims processors, and utilizing the most advanced IT. We will also increase the use of video teleconference hearings to address claims appeals.</p>
<p>VA will continue to expand implementation of PACT to improve partnerships with Veterans and eligible beneficiaries, increase team-based care coordination and management, and expand access to care. VA will improve patient-facing and clinician-facing e-health systems by expanding the development and use of health-related virtual modalities. These modalities include telehealth<a href="http://prep3.uat.performance.reisys.com/node/1013/edit?destination=node/5%3Fq%3Dviews/ajax%26page%3D1#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a>, E-Consult<a href="http://prep3.uat.performance.reisys.com/node/1013/edit?destination=node/5%3Fq%3Dviews/ajax%26page%3D1#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a>, secure messaging, MyHealtheVet, and mobile applications.</p>
<p>VA will enhance client satisfaction by capturing client data once, sharing it enterprise-wide, and using this client data for a lifetime, which will promote more efficient use of data across business lines. We will identify sources of consistent, reliable, and authoritative Veteran data. We will establish architecture, business rules, roles and responsibilities, and governance to enable VA lines of business to use the authoritative common client data to improve delivery of benefits and services to Veterans. VA will gain access to additional external data, knowledge, and experiences so we can broaden our understanding of our client’s needs and expectations. We will enable secure, privacy-protected electronic exchange of personal, health, and economic data on Veterans from induction oath through the final survivor benefit.</p>
<p>VA will rethink its operations as a Department, defining the fundamental crosscutting capabilities and interdependencies required to perform them. We will identify and address any internal organizational, policy, procedural, perceptual, and cultural boundaries that constrain our ability to coordinate, integrate, and deliver benefits and services.</p>
<p>VA will streamline its virtual presence (Web sites, portals and call centers), reducing duplication and enhancing personalization to enable clients to get the information they need, on their schedule.</p>
<p>VA will increase access to burial benefits in national cemeteries through its plans to construct five new national cemeteries and by recognizing and addressing the unique needs of Veterans and eligible beneficiaries who reside in densely populated urban areas as well as sparsely populated rural locations. We will ensure that the service and appearance of our national cemeteries meets the highest standards commensurate with these national shrines.</p>

<p>By September 30, 2017, reach 90% agreement with the statement “I trust VA to fulfill our country’s commitment to Veterans.”</p>
<p>Because this is a new measure, VA will establish the baseline in FY16 and add the measure to surveys covering all of VA’s primary services and product lines.</p>
</p>
                                                      <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>VA offers a remarkable array of services and benefits to Veterans and eligible dependents. But the experience is disjointed and inconsistent. There are hundreds of phone numbers and thousands of websites, each operating independently under different standards. Similarly, there are a wide array of VA and non-VA resources at the Federal, state, local, corporate, non-profit and tribal level that are not coherently organized or coordinated into a single source or reference point for the Veteran.  Veterans deserve better and so do VA staff, who care deeply about delivering the best possible outcome for Veterans.</p>
<p>The Veterans Experience team is leading a powerful new effort to improve customer experiences across VA, nationwide. Our goal: Fostering the delivery of effective and easy customer experiences in which Veterans feel valued. We are achieving this goal the same way the world’s most successful companies do: by listening to our customers – Veterans, their families and supporters – when they describe how they want things to work. Equally important, we are listening to our employees about obstacles to excellence on-the-job. Employee empowerment is an essential part of the equation. This is user-centered design. It puts Veterans and the employees who serve them front and center.</p>
<p>VA and the Veterans Experience team face a number of challenges and barriers:</p>
<ul><li>Siloed products and services without a common view of customers and their needs and wants.</li>
<li>Customer touchpoints and experiences owned by individual product and service teams, not integrated within a complementary suite of offerings.</li>
<li>Insular approach that does not account for the community resources used by customers.</li>
</ul><p>The APG will track our ability to overcome these barriers by implementing the strategies described in the next section.</p>
<p>To build trust among our customers, VA must consistently deliver customer experiences marked by effectiveness, ease, and engagement.<a href="http://www.performance.gov/node/62291/edit?add_indicator=#_ftn1">[1]</a> To ensure comparability across VA’s disparate service and product lines, the same measures of Trust and Customer Experience will be applied.</p>
<p><strong>Trust</strong></p>
<p>VA earns trust among Veterans by knowing them and showing that we care; by understanding and anticipating their needs; by providing fair benefits and timely services; by being there when they need us; and by keeping our promises. With every interaction, VA has the opportunity to deepen a trusting relationship with Veterans, or to diminish that trust.</p>
<p>Our Agency Priority Goal states: By September 30, 2017, VA will reach 90% agreement with the statement “I trust VA to fulfill our country’s commitment to Veterans.”</p>
<p>Timeline:</p>
<p>Q1 FY16:               Trust and Experience measures incorporated into existing customer experience surveys</p>
<p>Q2 FY16:               Baseline data collection begins</p>
<p>Q3 FY16:               Baseline measurement established; quarterly targets specified</p>
<p>Q4 FY 2016:          Publish quarterly update</p>
<p>Q1 FY 2017:          70 percent of VA customers surveyed ‘agree’ or ‘strongly agree’ with Trust  statement Customer Experience</p>
<p>Q2 FY 2017:          75 percent of VA customers surveyed ‘agree’ or ‘strongly agree’ with Trust statement Customer Experience</p>
<p>Q3 FY 2017:          80 percent of VA customers surveyed ‘agree’ or ‘strongly agree’ with Trust statement Customer Experience</p>
<p>Q4 FY17:               90% of VA customers surveyed ‘agree’ or ‘strongly agree’ with Trust statement</p>
<p><strong>Customer Experience</strong></p>
<p>Trust in VA is built one interaction at a time. The experience must be effective; it must be easy; and, ideally, it must be engaging and reflective of a valued, personal relationship with our customer. Trust is broken when VA does not consistently meet expectations in these three categories. VA will use customers’ ratings of their individual experiences as indicators of performance toward the overall Veterans Experience APG.</p>
<p>The measures will include level of agreement with questions such as:</p>
<ul><li>Effectiveness: “I got the service I needed.”</li>
<li>Ease: “It was easy to get the service I needed.”</li>
<li>Engagement: “I felt like a valued customer.”</li>
</ul><p>These measures are also new, and will be implemented along the timeline for the Trust measure indicated above. They will be added to new and existing VA customer experience surveys where responses will be correlated with operational data to highlight performance improvement opportunities that will improve Veterans experiences.</p>

<p>The development and proliferation of virtual access to care supports an organizational approach that is personalized, proactive, and patient-driven.  VA virtual health services use technology and health informatics to provide Veterans with better access and more effective care management.  Advances in virtual care expand where health care services can be accessed, reduce the need for travel to medical facilities, and transform VA’s delivery of health care and its effect on patients’ health outcomes.</p>
