                  <div>
                      <p><strong>Strategic Objective Review Summary of Findings: </strong>The Department of Justice, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, has determined that performance toward this objective is making Noteworthy Progress</p>
<p>In FY 2015, the Department continued its commitment to upholding the civil and constitutional rights of all Americans.  The Department successfully sought a 33-count indictment against Dylann Storm Roof, charging him with federal hate crimes under the Shepard-Byrd Act, as well as firearms charges, for killing and attempting to kill African-American parishioners at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina.  Also in FY 2015, DOJ issued a report on its investigation of the fatal shooting of Michael Brown by Officer Darren Wilson of the Ferguson, Missouri Police Department, finding that the evidence did not support federal civil rights charges against Officer Wilson.  DOJ issued a report on its pattern and practice investigation of the Ferguson Police Department and determined that the Ferguson Police Department engages in a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the United States Constitution and federal law.  DOJ found that this unconstitutional conduct stems from the interaction of two dynamics:  Ferguson’s undue focus on revenue generation through policing and pervasive racial bias in the police department and court system.</p>
<p>The Department also reached an agreement with Leflore County, Mississippi, to improve security and facility conditions at the Leflore County Juvenile Detention Center.  In the agreement, Leflore County committed to numerous reforms to protect children in its care from abuse and self-harm.</p>
<p>In July 2015, the Department went to trial in a lawsuit against the State of North Carolina over voting rules signed into law in August 2013.  The North Carolina law includes troubling new voting restrictions, such as provisions that will significantly reduce early voting days; eliminate same-day registration during early voting; and prohibit the counting of otherwise legitimate provisional ballots that are mistakenly cast in the right county but in the wrong precinct.</p>
<p>The Department also sued three separate owners or servicers of private and federally guaranteed student loans (collectively, “Sallie Mae”) alleging that they violated the rights of service members eligible for benefits and protections under the Service Members Civil Relief Act.  In May 2015, the Department announced that Sallie Mae was distributing $60 million in compensation to over 70,000 service members for the alleged violations and $55,000 to the United States as a civil penalty.</p>
<p>The Department will continue to devote substantial resources to address unconstitutional policing practices throughout the country; seek additional opportunities to educate workers and employers about the anti-discrimination provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act; protect students from sexual harassment through compliance reviews, outreach, technical assistance, and litigation; expand the Department’s already successful human trafficking program; and continue to analyze successful outcomes from past cases to develop best practices for encouraging effective and accountable policing.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The vast majority of violent crime in this country falls within the jurisdiction of state and local agencies, and the vast majority of resources to combat it are provided by state and local governments.  While some cities are well-equipped to handle issues involving violent gangs, many smaller cities and towns are easily overwhelmed by the violence and criminal activity that gangs bring to their communities.  Each community faces different challenges that will require different solutions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Department will combat violent crime through vigorous investigation and prosecution of those who engage in violent criminal acts.  It will work with its law enforcement partners at the federal, state, local, tribal, and international level to combat all types of violence, from the neighborhood-based street gangs, to increasingly brutal and prevalent violence along the Southwest Border, to the transnational gangs operating throughout the United States and abroad, to violent criminals seeking haven in the United States.  It will also employ a comprehensive strategy that focuses on investigation, prosecution, and prevention efforts to address violence in America.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Unfortunately, children are but one segment of society that is at risk.  In the United States and across the globe, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, human trafficking, and stalking occur in all ages, races, socioeconomic classes, genders, and sexual orientations.  Research shows that these crimes are overwhelmingly committed against women.  In addition, elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation is an area that has been overlooked but research suggests it is an ongoing problem in the United States.  Further, victims of crime committed on tribal lands is also an area that has been overlooked for far too long as research suggests violent crime rates may be two, four, and in some cases, 10 times the national average.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Department continues to stress efforts to reduce and respond to violence against vulnerable populations.  In April of 2013, the Department issued a revised Sexual Assault Forensic Examination Protocol to standardize up-to-date approaches to victim-centered forensic medical examinations.  DOJ will also work with the FBI to support states’ implementation of the revised Uniform Crime Report definition of “rape.”  As part of the Attorney General’s Defending Childhood Initiative, the Department will: launch a public awareness and community action campaign to stem youth violence; establish a Task Force on American Indian/Alaska Native Children Exposed to Violence; and partner with select states to form “State Commissions” that will implement model public policy initiatives at the state and local level to reduce the impact of children’s exposure to violence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All victims deserve to be treated with respect and support.  The Department will address the needs of victims by investigating and prosecuting matters impacting vulnerable groups while leading the way in providing innovative training, resources, and support to victims of crime.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The Southwest Border region is a particularly vulnerable area and has increasingly become a focal point in the national security strategy due to the considerable cross-border law enforcement challenges in the region.  The flow of narcotics north into the United States, along with the smuggling of criminal monetary proceeds and the illegal trafficking of firearms south out of the United States has had a devastating effect on the United States and Mexico, particularly along the Southwest Border.  Much of the violence along the Southwest Border region and in Mexico is perpetuated by drug trafficking organizations vying for control of trafficking routes to the United States and engaging in turf battles for disputed distribution territories.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The vast 5,225-mile border between the United States and Canada, and the evolving drug trafficking trends on both sides of that border, provide numerous challenges for law enforcement and intelligence entities operating along the Northern border under differing authorities, protocols, and expertise.  Marijuana and Ecstasy remain the most significant Northern border drug threats to the United States, while the United States remains the primary transit country for cocaine into Canada from South America.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>These offenses represent separate and very severe threats to the United States’ economy.  The corruption of federal, state, and locally elected, appointed, or contracted officials, whether foreign or domestic, undermines democratic institutions and may threaten the condition of the economy, public safety, and national security, while wasting many taxpayer dollars.  As businesses, governments, educational institutions, and individual citizens continue to integrate the Internet and other global network computer systems, extortionists, hostile insiders, identity thieves, and other criminals have new opportunities and new venues to commit unlawful acts.  The increased presence of fraud such as corporate fraud, securities fraud, healthcare fraud, and mortgage fraud have escalated and will continue to hamper economic recovery and persist long after any recovery occurs.  IP crime poses a grave threat to the country’s economic well-being, as well as the health and safety of U.S. citizens.  Finally, transnational crime has expanded dramatically in size, scope, and influence, and transnational criminal networks pose a significant threat to national and international security.  In response, the Department will implement actions to support the Administration’s <em>Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime</em>, which seeks to build, balance, and integrate the tools of American power to combat transnational organized crime and related threats to national security and urge America’s foreign partners to do the same.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Department will pursue fraud and corruption committed against the Federal Government and state and local governments and their programs and will protect consumers through vigorous investigations and civil and criminal enforcement of federal laws.  These efforts will return significant amounts to the Treasury, Medicare, and other entitlement programs every year and provide deterrence to those contemplating defrauding federal programs, businesses, and individual citizens.</p>
