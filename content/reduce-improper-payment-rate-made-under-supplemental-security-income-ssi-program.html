By September 30, 2015*, we will reduce the improper payment rate made under the SSI program to no more than 6.2% of all payments made under the SSI program (i.e. overpayments and underpayments).</p>
<p>*Because of the difficulties in evaluating payment accuracy, there is a 7-month lag in obtaining end–of-year data.  We will not have FY 2014 data available until April 2015.  FY 2015 data will be available in April 2016.</p>

            <h2>Goal Overview</h2>
            <!--<div class="teaser collapsed">
                                            </div>-->
            <div class="">
                <p>SSI is a means-tested program designed to provide a monthly payment to aged, blind, or disabled people with limited income and resources. Adults, as well as children, can receive payments based on disability or blindness.</p>
<p>SSI payments are calculated using a statutory definition where payment levels for beneficiaries can change from month-to–month, which may result in an improper payment. Two factors used to determine an individual's monthly benefit are income and living arrangements. Income can be in cash or in-kind, and is usually anything that a person receives that can be used to obtain food or shelter. Cash income includes wages, Social Security and other pensions, and unemployment compensation. In-kind income is food and shelter or something someone can use to obtain those items.</p>
<p>Individuals' SSI benefit amounts also may change if they move in to a different “living arrangement”—whether a person lives alone or with others, or resides in a medical facility or other institution. For instance, when an individual moves into a nursing home, the person’s monthly payment may be reduced to as little as $30 per month. If the person moves from his or her own household into the household of another person, and that person provides food or shelter, the payment also may be reduced.</p>
<p>An individual’s resources also affect eligibility for the SSI program. An individual is not eligible for benefits if his or her countable resources exceed $2,000, and couples are not eligible if their countable resources exceed $3,000. In general, SSA counts as resources items individuals can convert to cash and use for their support and maintenance, such as bank accounts, stocks, and bonds.</p>
<p>The design of the SSI program requires that SSA adjust benefit payments to account for these factors. SSA explains to SSI recipients that they must report these changes to us when they occur. Absent their timely reporting, it is difficult to obtain information about these changes in a prompt fashion, resulting in some erroneous payments. Additionally, even if individuals report in a timely manner, SSA is required to first provide written notification of how the change affects their benefit amounts and provide due process protections. This process delays adjusting payments to the correct amount. Furthermore, SSA generally makes SSI payments on the first day of the month for eligibility in that month. Even if the payment is correct when paid, any changes that may occur during the month can affect the payment due, which can result in an overpayment or underpayment. Thus, the program requirements themselves sometimes cause erroneous payments.</p>
<p>SSA’s SSI improper payment accuracy reflects the complex nature of the SSI program. SSA is working on improving administration of the SSI program, focusing on how technology can make the agency more efficient. SSA is currently offering telephone wage reporting and a smart-phone application for reporting wages and is expanding our use of those technologies.  SSA is also working on expanded use of Lexis-Nexis to verify real property, and numerous other projects designed to improve our service and ensure the integrity of our payments.</p>

                <p>To assist in debt reduction efforts and protect taxpayer dollars, SSA must implement projects that will reduce improper payments with minimal administrative cost.  SSA is committed to reducing SSI overpayments and underpayments by increasing the volume of our program integrity workload, and pursuing new initiatives and program improvements to the extent funding is available.</p>
<p><strong>Redeterminations</strong> are a process SSA uses to re-examine recipients’ income and resources to ensure that they are still eligible for monthly payments.  Redeterminations are one of our most powerful program integrity tools.  SSA estimates that every dollar spent on SSI redeterminations yields about $5 in program savings over 10 years, including Medicaid program effects.</p>
<p><strong>Predictive modeling techniques</strong> have proven to be immensely helpful to ensure that we use our resources effectively and efficiently.  SSA does not have the resources to conduct redeterminations on all 8.1 million SSI recipients every year.  Using our SSI Redetermination Scoring Model, SSA targets the cases most likely to be overpaid.  In FY 2012, SSA completed 2,624,170 SSI non-disability redeterminations, which resulted in the prevention and recovery of $2.85 billion in total lifetime SSI overpayments and prevented $1.27 billion in underpayments. If SSA had relied on random case selection rather than using a predictive model, $2.1 billion in total lifetime savings for SSA projects would have been prevented and recovered for the same period.</p>
<p><strong>Access to Financial Institutions (AFI) </strong>is an electronic system that allows us to detect assets in undisclosed bank accounts.  Detection of these assets prevents one of the most frequent causes of SSI erroneous payments.  Use of AFI will achieve an estimated increase of about $432 million in annual program savings (i.e., reductions in overpayments).  SSA recently integrated the AFI process into our SSI case processing system, which enables us to check for undisclosed accounts at randomly selected financial institutions located near the recipient’s address.  In May 2013, SSA modified the agency’s policy, lowered the AFI threshold from $750 to $400, and increased the number of undisclosed bank account searches from five to ten.  SSA will implement this new threshold and increase in bank account searches by the end of October 2013. SSA will evaluate the impact of lowering the threshold and increasing our bank searches and continue to make enhancements to the AFI initiative.</p>
<p>SSA is always looking for more effective and efficient ways to fulfill the agency’s mission.  Building upon our AFI success, SSA is exploring the use of commercial databases to help SSA identify <strong>undisclosed non-home real property</strong> held by SSI applicants and recipients.  This automated approach has the potential for helping us uncover unreported assets and improve the accuracy and integrity of the SSI program.</p>
<p><strong>SSI Wage Reporting</strong> provides recipients with an easy way to report their wages to us that also saves resources by updating our records directly without requiring employee handling.  Unreported and untimely reported wages continue to be a major source of payment error in the SSI program.</p>
<p>To facilitate timely reporting, we implemented the SSI Telephone Wage Reporting (SSITWR) system.  Recipients, their spouses and parents, and their representative payees report monthly wages directly into the SSI system via a combination of touch-tone entry and voice-recognition software.  SSITWR is more efficient because it reduces unnecessary visits to the field office, diminishes the opportunity for manual keying errors, and allows us to process wage reports early enough to adjust the next SSI payment, thereby preventing improper payments.</p>
<p><strong>SSI Mobile Wage Reporting</strong> <strong>(SSIMWR)</strong> application is an extension of the SSITWR system, which provides SSI recipients the ability to submit their wages via their mobile smart phones.  Like its telephone counterpart, the mobile application will automatically update the SSI record, correct the upcoming payment, if necessary, and issue a receipt to the individual.  In FY 2013, as part of SSA’s online services initiatives, SSA began piloting the SSIMWR program in 50 field offices in December 2012 and expanded it nationally in September 2013. The SSIMWR allows mobile wage reporting on smartphones.  Participants can download and use the free SSIMWR application to report wages.  SSA also posted a webcast to promote the use of SSITWR and SSIMWR.</p>
<p>SSA will continue to recruit SSI recipients to use this application and track the increase in usage. In FY 2014, SSA will allow individuals to report at any time during the month rather than just the first six days of the month.</p>
<p>SSA will begin efforts to automate the use of monthly payroll provider information and integrate it into our internal SSI computer systems by adding a consent question into our SSI application.  This question will allow SSA to automatically change payments to SSI recipients once the agency is able to automate the wage reporting from payroll providers.</p>
<p>SSA will also continue to explore opportunities with other Federal agencies to obtain information about SSI recipients who leave the country and fail to report their absence.</p>
<p><strong>Transactional Accuracy- </strong>Each year SSA measures the compliance of field offices with the documentation and development requirements in our policy and procedures.  SSA bases this accuracy on a monthly sample selection of completed field office transactions for the Supplemental Security Record. If the reviewed case does not meet the required evidentiary standards, SSA secures the necessary evidence.  If this changes the payment in the original determination, we record a dollar error.  SSA categorizes dollar errors as either underpayments or overpayments. In FY 2012, overall dollar accuracy was 98.9 percent for overpayments and 99.2 percent for underpayments.</p>

            <h2>Progress Update</h2>
            <div>
                <p>We are actively engaged in a host of different efforts to improve Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payment accuracy and help ensure that we pay the right person, the right amount, at the right time. For example, in FY 2014, we completed a comprehensive study related to our use of commercial data to identify non-home real property in which SSI recipients have an ownership interest that may affect their eligibility for benefits. The study concluded that utilizing commercially available data in this manner would be cost beneficial to the agency.  In FY 2015, we pursued changes to our systems and processes that would be required to efficiently use such information. On a concurrent track, we continue to realize increased usage of our automated wage reporting tools, both of which save agency administrative dollars while also improving SSI payment accuracy. We had an overall increase in the number of successful wage reports we processed using SSI Telephone Wage Reporting (SSITWR) and SSI Mobile Wage Reporting (SSIMWR).</p>
<p>
In FY 2015, we continued to evaluate the results of conducting Access to Financial Institutions searches at periodic intervals (i.e. between redeterminations). In FY 2015, we completed 100 percent of our target, by conducting 2,266,993 redeterminations and limited issues. This goal will be assessed in April 2016 after the final data is available for all indicators.</p>
<p><strong>FY 2015 Milestone Progress:</strong></p>
<p class="rtejustify"><strong>Q1 Milestone</strong> - Analyze the success of the mobile wage reporting application to determine the need for modifications.  Determine agency decisions and next steps resulting from the non-home real property studies.  Analyze the impact of lowering the AFI threshold to determine the additional number of bank accounts found that resulted in changes in or ineligibility for SSI payments.</p>
<ul><li class="rtejustify">Mobile Wage Reporting - We continued to see positive growth in the use of mobile wage reporting  and processed 13% more transactions via this modality than the volume processed in Q4 of FY 2014.  We realized an overall increase of 19% in the number of combined telephone and mobile wage reports over Q1 in FY 2014.</li>
<li class="rtejustify">Non-home real property study - Based on the positive outcome of the studies, we began planning for systems integration of the non-home real property process.</li>
<li class="rtejustify">AFI - We finalized the protocol for an evaluation of the impact from lowering the AFI threshold and are gathering the data needed to complete the evaluation.</li>
</ul><p class="rtejustify"><strong>Q2 Milestone</strong> - Determine the feasibility of capturing optional electronic permission to obtain wage information from payroll providers in order to explore opportunities to integrate this information into our SSI systems.  Develop an implementation plan for non-home real property to integrate it into the current SSI business process.</p>
<ul><li class="rtejustify">We have allocated resources to integrate authorization for us to contact commercial entities for evidence related to SSI eligibility and payment amount.  We developed the requirements to make these changes to our systems.</li>
<li class="rtejustify">We have also allocated resources to integrate the non-home real property process into our systems.  We made significant progress in our effort to determine the business process for such integration and develop systems requirements.</li>
</ul><p class="rtejustify"><strong>Q3 Milestone</strong> - Increase our ability to detect improper payments by initiating the non-home real property implementation plan.</p>
<ul><li class="rtejustify">In Q3, we will continue moving forward with our implementation plan and request agency resources to fully support the non-home real property initiative in FY 2016 and 2017.   Internal project participants meet every two weeks and include the Offices of Budget, Finance, Quality &amp; Management, Systems, Policy, and Operations.</li>
</ul><p class="rtejustify"><strong>Q4 Milestone</strong> – Explore opportunities with the Department of State to obtain passport information from SSI recipients who leave the United States and do not report their absence to prevent us from making improper payments to these individuals.</p>
<ul><li class="rtejustify">We are no longer exploring this opportunity with the Department of State as we have determined that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) possesses more comprehensive entry and exit data.</li>
<li class="rtejustify">We will continue to pursue our efforts to test a matching operations with DHS that would permit us to obtain information electronically regarding a recipient’s absence from the United States for a full calendar month or longer.</li>
</ul><p>Next Steps</p>
<p>•We will continue to revise our current Supplemental Security Income (SSI) business process to use third party data to identify undisclosed real property ownership in order to detect and prevent improper payments. In addition, we will revise our systems planning template to expand the scope of the FY 2016 development.<br />
•We will continue to pursue efforts to test a matching operation with DHS.<br />
•We will continue to process redeterminations and limited issues to evaluate a recipient’s eligibility for SSI and benefit payment amount.<br />
•We are moving forward with our implementation plan and requested agency resources to support fully the non-home real property (NHRP) initiatives in FYs 2016 and 2017.</p>

<p>In FY 2013, the overpayment (O/P) accuracy rate was 92.4 percent based on overpaid dollars totaling a projected $4.2 billion. Payment accuracy for all Title XVI underpayments (U/P) was 98.3 percent based on unpaid dollars projected at $0.9 billion. In FY 2012, the Title XVI O/P accuracy rate was 93.7 percent, and the Title XVI U/P accuracy rate was 98.2 percent.</p>
<p>In FY 2014 the Title XVI, overpayment accuracy rate was 93.0 percent.  Title XVI underpayment accuracy increased from 98.3 percent in FY 2013 to 98.5 percent in FY 2014.  For Title II, overpayment accuracy declined from 99.8 percent in FY 2013 to 99.5 percent in FY 2014.  This reduction is due to a large increase in WEP and GPO error dollars.  Title II underpayment accuracy remained the same in FY 2014 at 99.9 percent.  The changes from FY 2013 to FY 2014 are not statistically significant.</p>

</div>                                <div class='data-items'><span>Indicator Overview:</span> <p>We report annually on the findings from our Title XVI stewardship (payment accuracy) review of the non-medical aspects of Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments.   FY 2014 data is not yet available to report.</p>
<p>In FY 2013, the overpayment (O/P) accuracy rate was 92.4 percent based on overpaid dollars totaling a projected $4.2 billion. Payment accuracy for all Title XVI underpayments (U/P) was 98.3 percent based on unpaid dollars projected at $0.9 billion. In FY 2012, the Title XVI O/P accuracy rate was 93.7 percent, and the Title XVI U/P accuracy rate was 98.2 percent.</p>
<p>In FY 2014 the Title XVI, overpayment accuracy rate was 93.0 percent.  Title XVI underpayment accuracy increased from 98.3 percent in FY 2013 to 98.5 percent in FY 2014.  For Title II, overpayment accuracy declined from 99.8 percent in FY 2013 to 99.5 percent in FY 2014.  This reduction is due to a large increase in WEP and GPO error dollars.  Title II underpayment accuracy remained the same in FY 2014 at 99.9 percent.  The changes from FY 2013 to FY 2014 are not statistically significant.</p>

<li>Even after we approve a person for benefits, we periodically review many of their cases to ensure that they continue to meet the eligibility requirements under each program.  For example, we complete SSI redeterminations, which are periodic reviews of non-medical factors of SSI eligibility, such as income and resources.  On average SSI non-medical redeterminations produce about $5 of net program savings per dollar spent, with savings from overpayments partly offset from the cost for underpayments.</li>

By September 30, 2015*, we will reduce the improper payment rate made under the SSI program to no more than 6.2% of all payments made under the SSI program (i.e. overpayments and underpayments).</p>
<p>*Because of the difficulties in evaluating payment accuracy, there is a 7-month lag in obtaining end–of-year data.  We will not have FY 2014 data available until April 2015.  FY 2015 data will be available in April 2016.</p>
</p>
                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>SSI is a means-tested program designed to provide a monthly payment to aged, blind, or disabled people with limited income and resources. Adults, as well as children, can receive payments based on disability or blindness.</p>
<p>SSI payments are calculated using a statutory definition where payment levels for beneficiaries can change from month-to–month, which may result in an improper payment. Two factors used to determine an individual's monthly benefit are income and living arrangements. Income can be in cash or in-kind, and is usually anything that a person receives that can be used to obtain food or shelter. Cash income includes wages, Social Security and other pensions, and unemployment compensation. In-kind income is food and shelter or something someone can use to obtain those items.</p>
<p>Individuals' SSI benefit amounts also may change if they move in to a different “living arrangement”—whether a person lives alone or with others, or resides in a medical facility or other institution. For instance, when an individual moves into a nursing home, the person’s monthly payment may be reduced to as little as $30 per month. If the person moves from his or her own household into the household of another person, and that person provides food or shelter, the payment also may be reduced.</p>
<p>An individual’s resources also affect eligibility for the SSI program. An individual is not eligible for benefits if his or her countable resources exceed $2,000, and couples are not eligible if their countable resources exceed $3,000. In general, SSA counts as resources items individuals can convert to cash and use for their support and maintenance, such as bank accounts, stocks, and bonds.</p>
<p>The design of the SSI program requires that SSA adjust benefit payments to account for these factors. SSA explains to SSI recipients that they must report these changes to us when they occur. Absent their timely reporting, it is difficult to obtain information about these changes in a prompt fashion, resulting in some erroneous payments. Additionally, even if individuals report in a timely manner, SSA is required to first provide written notification of how the change affects their benefit amounts and provide due process protections. This process delays adjusting payments to the correct amount. Furthermore, SSA generally makes SSI payments on the first day of the month for eligibility in that month. Even if the payment is correct when paid, any changes that may occur during the month can affect the payment due, which can result in an overpayment or underpayment. Thus, the program requirements themselves sometimes cause erroneous payments.</p>
<p>SSA’s SSI improper payment accuracy reflects the complex nature of the SSI program. SSA is working on improving administration of the SSI program, focusing on how technology can make the agency more efficient. SSA is currently offering telephone wage reporting and a smart-phone application for reporting wages and is expanding our use of those technologies.  SSA is also working on expanded use of Lexis-Nexis to verify real property, and numerous other projects designed to improve our service and ensure the integrity of our payments.</p>

                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Statement:<span class="acc_content_label"><p>Reduce the improper payment rate made under the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. By September 30, 2015*, we will reduce the improper payment rate made under the SSI program to no more than 6.2% of all payments made under the SSI program (i.e. overpayments and underpayments).</p>
<p>*Because of the difficulties in evaluating payment accuracy, there is a 7-month lag in obtaining end–of-year data.  We will not have FY 2014 data available until April 2015.  FY 2015 data will be available in April 2016.</p>

                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:<span class="acc_content_label"><p>SSI is a means-tested program designed to provide a monthly payment to aged, blind, or disabled people with limited income and resources. Adults, as well as children, can receive payments based on disability or blindness.</p>
<p>SSI payments are calculated using a statutory definition where payment levels for beneficiaries can change from month-to–month, which may result in an improper payment. Two factors used to determine an individual's monthly benefit are income and living arrangements. Income can be in cash or in-kind, and is usually anything that a person receives that can be used to obtain food or shelter. Cash income includes wages, Social Security and other pensions, and unemployment compensation. In-kind income is food and shelter or something someone can use to obtain those items.</p>
<p>Individuals' SSI benefit amounts also may change if they move in to a different “living arrangement”—whether a person lives alone or with others, or resides in a medical facility or other institution. For instance, when an individual moves into a nursing home, the person’s monthly payment may be reduced to as little as $30 per month. If the person moves from his or her own household into the household of another person, and that person provides food or shelter, the payment also may be reduced.</p>
<p>An individual’s resources also affect eligibility for the SSI program. An individual is not eligible for benefits if his or her countable resources exceed $2,000, and couples are not eligible if their countable resources exceed $3,000. In general, SSA counts as resources items individuals can convert to cash and use for their support and maintenance, such as bank accounts, stocks, and bonds.</p>
<p>The design of the SSI program requires that SSA adjust benefit payments to account for these factors. SSA explains to SSI recipients that they must report these changes to us when they occur. Absent their timely reporting, it is difficult to obtain information about these changes in a prompt fashion, resulting in some erroneous payments. Additionally, even if individuals report in a timely manner, SSA is required to first provide written notification of how the change affects their benefit amounts and provide due process protections. This process delays adjusting payments to the correct amount. Furthermore, SSA generally makes SSI payments on the first day of the month for eligibility in that month. Even if the payment is correct when paid, any changes that may occur during the month can affect the payment due, which can result in an overpayment or underpayment. Thus, the program requirements themselves sometimes cause erroneous payments.</p>
<p>SSA’s SSI improper payment accuracy reflects the complex nature of the SSI program. SSA is working on improving administration of the SSI program, focusing on how technology can make the agency more efficient. SSA is currently offering telephone wage reporting and a smart-phone application for reporting wages and is expanding our use of those technologies.  SSA is also working on expanded use of Lexis-Nexis to verify real property, and numerous other projects designed to improve our service and ensure the integrity of our payments.</p>
