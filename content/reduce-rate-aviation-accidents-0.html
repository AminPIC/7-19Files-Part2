                <p>Aviation fatality rates are at historic lows and continue to drop over time.  However, FAA recognizes the need to continue addressing precursors to accidents in order to continue to improve the current level of safety in the national airspace.</p>
<p>In the past, the FAA focused on actual incidents and accidents to identify risk within the aviation system.  The number of accidents has now dropped to a level in which this is a more difficult activity.  The FAA has now developed a proactive approach to identify and address risk.  This is done through dramatically increased air traffic data collection, improved analysis, and the implementation of safety mitigations put in place before an accident occurs.</p>

<li>The FAA is also embarking on a significant transformational effort aimed at improving its oversight of certificate-holding organizations within the GA community.  The introduction of system safety to GA oversight models will help the FAA to identify hazards and eliminate or control associated risks, through our system safety outreach. Certificate holding organizations will gain the knowledge and skills needed to improve risk management, and with it safety, without additional cost.  Certificate holders, who have adopted safety management systems, or the appropriate elements of such a system, have enjoyed cost savings resulting from lower insurance rates and reduced maintenance expenses.  The FAA is confident the GA community will adopt system safety methods, resulting in the cost and safety benefits enjoyed by the air carrier community.</li>

<p>The Runway Safety Focus Airport program connected to the enhancement of the Local Runway Safety Action Team supports The FAA in implementing the National Runway Safety Plan for 2015-2017 which was published in July 2014.  This plan provides a complete overview of all the tools and programs at the FAA’s disposal to identify, analyze, and address risk model for all airport stakeholders will allow the FAA to implement a proactive approach to mitigating surface safety by focusing on precursors rather than react to events as they occur.  The Local Runway Safety Action Team effort has been improved with increased support by the Runway Safety Group to reach 100 percent of FAA towered air traffic facilities.</p>
<p>The FAA hosted the Call to Action for Runway Safety on June 24, 2015 to produce an action plan and collaborative roadmap for developing runway safety solutions for the aviation community.  Over 100 attendees from the FAA, industry, and labor reviewed data and identified issues and risk factors in three breakout sessions related to visual recognition, communications and procedures and awareness.  These sessions produced 29 recommendations to improve runway safety for which we’ve now developed detailed implementation plans in the final report.  The work described in the implementation plans is underway and the status is being monitored by the Runway Safety Council.</p>
<p>All of the recommendations in the Call to Action are on time or completed as scheduled thus far in 2016.  The statuses of those recommendations were briefed during the Runway Safety Council meeting held on July 13, 2016. </p>
<p><strong>Hazard Risk Mitigations</strong></p>
<p>Each year, the ATO prioritizes the most serious safety hazards in the NAS to establish the Top 5, one of the most visible outcomes of our commitment to risk-based decision-making. Previously, the ATO relied exclusively on data from the Risk Analysis Process (RAP) and the Air Traffic Safety Action Program (ATSAP) data to determine which hazards belonged in the Top 5; today, data from all of the following sources inform the Top 5 selection process: Airborne RAP, Surface RAP, Service Integrity RAP (in process), Voluntary Safety Reporting Programs (ATSAP and T-SAP), ATM-related Fatal Accidents, Runway Safety Reports, Operational Safety Assessments, System Service Reviews, and the National Transportation Safety Board.  For each Top 5 hazard, an ATO workgroup is tasked with developing plans to assess and, where necessary, improve the policy, procedures, systems, or training associated with occurrences of that hazard. Resources are then dedicated to implementing the necessary mitigation strategies and monitoring, for at least two years, their effectiveness.</p>

            <h2>Progress Update</h2>
            <div>
                <p><u><strong>General Aviation Fatal Accident Rate</strong></u><br />
As of September 30, 2016, the rate was 0.91 versus a not-to-exceed (NTE) rate of 1.02 per 100,000 flight hours.  This equates to 219 fatal accidents versus a NTE target of 244 for the year.  These fatal accidents resulted in 413 fatalities through September 2016.  The General Aviation (GA) fatal NTE target is based on an estimated number of flight hours.</p>
<p>To reduce accidents, the General Aviation Joint Steering Committee (GAJSC) has established training topics for airmen based on GAJSC analysis of aircraft accidents.  Educational outreach is focused on one of these training topics each month.  During the third quarter of FY16, the FAA Safety Team (FAASTeam) and the FAA Office of Communications (AOC) completed educational outreach on the assigned topics via email, social media, and live seminars across the nation.</p>
<p>The three topics were Aircraft Performance and Limitations; Spatial Disorientation; and Engine Maintenance and Performance Monitoring. </p>
<p>In FY 2015, the GAJSC focused on system component failures and powerplant (engine-related) accidents.  Ten new safety interventions were developed to mitigate the risks discovered in this study.  These and 29 loss-of-control interventions are being implemented, with some having already been completed.  The FAA Deputy Administrator met with leaders from the general aviation community to support the work of the GAJSC and to continue the focus on reducing inflight loss-of-control accidents.  This meeting was used to increase the awareness of accident causes and work with industry to carry the safety message during the summer flying season.</p>
<p><u><strong>Commercial Air Carrier Fatality Rate</strong></u><br />
As of September 30, 2016, there was one fatal accident for the year.  Therefore, the actual rate is 0.6 versus a NTE of 6.7 fatalities per 100,000,000 (100 million) persons on board.  This equates to five fatalities against a NTE of 58 for the year.  </p>
<p>A new rule took effect in May of 2016 regarding Qualification, Service and Use of Crewmembers and Aircraft Dispatchers (part 121).  Another rule took effect in March of 2016 on Flight Simulation Training Device Qualification Standards for Extended Envelope and Adverse Weather Event Training Tasks (Part 60). The Part 60 rule was revised to require flight simulator modifications to support stall and upset training.  The part 60 rule supports the 2013 issued rule on Qualification and Training of Crewmembers and Aircraft Dispatchers.  It gives airlines and training centers three years to have their simulators evaluated and modified before compliance with the training rule when it goes into effect in 2019.</p>
<p><u><strong>Runway Incursions (Category A and B) Rate</strong></u></p>
<p>The Runway Incursion rate for fiscal year 2016 fourth quarter is 0.360 per million operations, compared to our annual target rate of 0.395 per million operations.  There have been a total of eighteen (18) Category A or B Runway Incursions in fiscal year 2016. This data is still preliminary and not the official end of fiscal year rate as there are several events still to be reviewed and categorized.</p>
<ul><li>October 2015:      2 Category B Pilot Deviations</li>
<li>November 2015:  1 Category A Operational Incident</li>
<li>November 2015:  1 Category B Vehicle Pedestrian Deviation</li>
<li>January 2016:       2 Category B Operational Incidents</li>
<li>January 2016:       1 Category A Pilot Deviation</li>
<li>February 2016:     2 Category A Pilot Deviations</li>
<li>February 2016:     1 Category B Operational Incident </li>
<li>March 2016:         1 Category A Operational Incident</li>
<li>April 2016:           1 Category B Pilot Deviation  </li>
<li>May 2016:            1 Category B Pilot Deviation  </li>
<li>June 2016:            1 Category B Operational Incident</li>
<li>July 2016:            1 Category A Pilot Deviation</li>
<li>July 2016:            1 Category B Pilot Deviation</li>
<li>August 2016:       1 Category A Operational Incident</li>
<li>August 2016:       1 Category B Operational Incident</li>
</ul><p>Hazard Risk Mitigations<br />
On September 2, 2016 the FAA announced the FY2017 ATO Top 5 issues contributing to risk in the national airspace system.  The FY17 Top 5 are:</p>
<ol><li>Instrument Flight Rules / Visual Flight Rules (IFR/VFR): Close encounters between IFR and VFR aircraft</li>
<li>Issuance/Cancelation of Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs): Lack of, untimely, or outdated NOTAMs in the system</li>
<li>NOTAM Prioritization: ATC or pilot unable to distinguish applicable or pertinent NOTAMs</li>
<li>Runway Flyovers: Unexpected aircraft/vehicle on the runway with another aircraft cleared to takeoff/land</li>
<li>Wrong Surface Landings: Aircraft lands on wrong runway, on taxiway, or at wrong airport.</li>
</ol><p> <br />
As of September 30, 2016  the FAA completed 88 percent (23 of 26) of Corrective Action Plan (CAP) activities developed to address the ATO’s Top 5 safety issues identified for the Fiscal Year 2016. </p>

            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            <div>
                <p><strong><u>General Aviation Fatal Accident Rate</u></strong></p>
<p>We are continuously trying to work with our agency and industry partners to reduce the number of general aviation fatalities.</p>
<ul><li>Twenty-nine Safety Enhancements (SEs) have been or are currently being implemented, which address fatal accidents resulting from loss of control-inflight (LOC).  (Ongoing)</li>
<li>Ten SEs related to system component failures were approved by the GAJSC, and are being implemented.  (Ongoing)</li>
<li>Support of the GAJSC, International Helicopter Safety Team (IHST), and US Helicopter Safety Team (USHST) focusing on airman certification and operating standards.  Make revisions to training and operations guidance/policy as necessary based on data analysis conducted by the GAJSC, IHST, and approved Safety Enhancements (SEs). (Ongoing)</li>
<li>Develop and implement a broad outreach campaign to reduce GA accidents by reducing runway incursions. (September 30, 2016)</li>
<li>Develop mitigating initiatives to reduce pilot deviations, including Runway Incursions, caused by a lack of English language proficiency. (Ongoing)</li>
<li>Focus on FAA Safety Team (FAASTeam) program products and product delivery systems.  Design and develop a system to “push” a continuous stream of aeronautical knowledge to airmen in a way that suits their lifestyle.  National FAASTeam Outreach Initiatives include safety articles in the FAA Safety Briefing magazine, FAAST Blast emails, aviation safety courses through the FAASafety.gov website, runway safety educational posters, live safety seminars on weather, ADS-B, UAS, Loss of Control and aeronautical decision making. (Ongoing)</li>
<li>Aviation Training Device (ATD) Final Rule was completed April 12, 2016 and became effective May 12, 2016.  This rule allows increased use of ATDs when obtaining instrument ratings and when receiving training under certain Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 141 appendices.  The rule allows more training scenarios to be conducted that are not possible in actual aircraft training.  Abnormal and emergency procedures training along with real-world decision-making skills are the focus.  This directly supports decreasing the GA fatal accident rate. </li>
<li>Develop Aviation Safety Information Analysis and Sharing (ASIAS) capabilities that build upon and extend existing capabilities for managing and processing aviation performance data and deploy visualization capabilities that aid causal/contributing factor analyses and risk assessment.</li>
</ul><p><strong><u>Commercial Air Carrier Fatality Rate</u></strong></p>
<ul><li>The FAA is working with aviation industry stakeholders to establish safety management systems within their operations.  With these systems in place, the FAA and the aviation industry will work together to address risks. </li>
<li>Our commercial safety record indicates the Agency has successfully addressed the majority of known system hazards contributing to accidents or incidents.  The FAA continues to work with aviation industry stakeholders to establish and implement safety management systems to address and reduce risk within their operations and the National Airspace System (NAS).  With these systems in place, the FAA and the aviation industry will work together to address risks. The Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST) has developed multiple safety enhancements and continues to achieve positive results.</li>
<li>Our success in commercial aviation safety is due in part to the aviation industry and government voluntarily investing in safety enhancements that reduce the fatality risk in commercial air travel in the United States.  The work of CAST, along with new aircraft, regulations, and other activities, continues to have a positive impact in reducing the fatality rate for commercial aviation in the United States.  CAST has developed 96 safety enhancements to date.  The last 19 enhancements were based on non-accident data, demonstrating its progress from reactive safety enhancements to proactive risk mitigation.  CAST has developed an integrated, data-driven strategy to reduce the commercial aviation fatality risk in the United States.</li>
</ul><p><strong><u>Runway Incursions (Category A and B) Rate</u></strong></p>
<ul><li>Runway Safety Focus Airports Program: Use risk indicators of actual measured events, e.g. runway incursions and excursions, and evaluation of potential or latent risk indicators (airport design, management and operational changes) to assess and improve policy, guidance, engagement and training strategies to address risk at Focus Airports.  The FY16 list was delivered to the Runway Safety Group in December 2015.  The information is being used to prioritize the mitigation efforts of the Local and Regional Runway Safety Action Teams. This effort is ongoing.</li>
<li>Closed Runway Operation Prevention Device: Use speech recognition technology to detect spoken clearances by air traffic controllers to closed runways.  (Ex.  “Cleared to Land Runway 10L” would create an alarm anytime that runway (10L) is closed and the phrase is monitored by the system).  A 30-day period of operational testing by JFK ATC began on August 23. MITRE is currently examining the data.</li>
<li>Local Runway Safety Action Team (LRSAT) Meeting:  Track completion of mandatory Local Runway Safety Action Team Meetings and subsequent development of their Local Runway Safety Action Plan through the team meetings.  This effort is ongoing.</li>
<li>Airport Construction Advisory Council:  Address surface safety issues associated with disruptions in air traffic operations caused by runway and taxiway construction. Using Safety Risk Management (SRM) processes, the council identifies weaknesses in the control measures undertaken by the FAA during periods of prolonged construction and develops mitigations to proactively address hazards. This effort is ongoing.</li>
<li>In August 2016, FAA released a detailed project timeline for the automation of construction notice diagrams.  This effort is ongoing.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Runway Safety Outreach and Education<u>:</u>  The National Runway Safety Plan provides the structure/outline for outreach/education to all FAA facilities, Federal Contract Towers, and industry stakeholders.  The FAA is leveraging existing platforms, safety organizations, and partnerships with industry groups, unions, local safety reps, and field managers as the primary path and channel for engagement and education.  This effort is ongoing. </li>
</ul><p><strong><u>Hazard Risk Mitigations</u></strong></p>
<ul><li>Continue tracking the implementation of mitigations/interventions identified for all ATO Top 5 Hazards’ Corrective Action Plans (CAPs). </li>
<li>Hold CAP development panels to address the Top 5 Hazards for the next fiscal year.</li>
<li>Develop and facilitate approval of the CAPs. </li>
<li>Track the implementation of mitigations/interventions identified for all ATO Top 5 Hazards’ CAPs. Follow-up with stakeholders to ensure that 80% of all identified activities are implemented. Due September 30, 2017</li>

Category A is an incident when a collision is narrowly avoided. Category B is an incident where there was significant potential for a collision.</p>
<p>The rate of Category A and B runway incursions is measured over a fiscal year.</p>
<p>Improvements in reporting systems and several years of safety culture enhancements encourage FAA employees to actively participate in the ATO Safety Management System.The FAA remains committed to identifying and addressing safety risks in the National Aerospace System through improved reporting and analysis of data.</p>

Surface event reports are reviewed on a daily basis to determine if the incident meets the definition of a runway incursion.  Runway incursions are a subset of the incident data collected and the completeness of the data is based on the reporting requirements and completeness for each of the incident types.  If the operations data are not up to date, these calculations must be revised. The rate may also need to be recalculated if runway incursions are reported late. Historical volume data have been changed over the last three years, resulting in adjustments to current baselines.</p>

                                <p><p>The Commercial Air Carrier Fatality Rate was met in FY 2013. The FY 2013 rate was 1.1 versus a not-to-exceed (NTE) rate of 7.4 fatalities per 100 million persons on board. This equates to an estimated not-to-exceed total number of fatalities of 58. There were two <em><u>Part 121 </u></em>fatal accidents for FY 2013 with <u>nine</u> fatalities (no passengers) for the year. Commercial air carrier fatal accidents have become extremely rare.  However, a single fatal accident could have one fatality or hundreds. To achieve this target, the agency is working collaboratively with industry to improve information sharing and analytical techniques so that FAA can proactively identify and mitigate risks in aviation.</p>

</div>                                <div class='data-items'><span>Indicator Overview:</span> <p>The Commercial Air Carrier Fatality Rate was met in FY 2013. The FY 2013 rate was 1.1 versus a not-to-exceed (NTE) rate of 7.4 fatalities per 100 million persons on board. This equates to an estimated not-to-exceed total number of fatalities of 58. There were two <em><u>Part 121 </u></em>fatal accidents for FY 2013 with <u>nine</u> fatalities (no passengers) for the year. Commercial air carrier fatal accidents have become extremely rare.  However, a single fatal accident could have one fatality or hundreds. To achieve this target, the agency is working collaboratively with industry to improve information sharing and analytical techniques so that FAA can proactively identify and mitigate risks in aviation.</p>
</div>                                <div class='data-items'><span>Unit Of Measurement:</span> Number of fatalities per 100 million persons on board </div>                                <div class='data-items'><span>Indicator Reporting Frequency:</span> Annually</div>                                <div class='data-items'><span>Indicator Data Timeliness:</span> <p>The number of actual persons on board for any given period is considered preliminary for up to 18 months after the close of the reporting period. This is due to amended reports subsequently filed by U.S. air carriers. Preliminary estimates are based on projections of the growth in departures developed by APL. However, changes to the number of persons on board should rarely affect the annual fatality rate.</p>
<p>NTSB and FAA's Office of Accident Investigation and Prevention meet regularly to validate the accident and fatality count. NTSB usually completes investigations and issues reports on accidents that occur during any fiscal year by the end of the next fiscal year. Results are considered final when all those accidents have been reported in the NTSB press release published by March. FY 2012 results will therefore be final after the 2014 press release. In general, however, fatal and serious injury accident numbers are not likely to change significantly between the end of the fiscal year and the date they are finalized.</p>

                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Statement:</span><p>Reduce the rate of roadway fatalities from 1.26 in 2008 to 1.03 per 100 million vehicle miles traveled (VMT) by December 31, 2018.</p>
</p>
                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>Background:</p>
<p>Reducing roadway fatalities continues to be a top priority at the Department of Transportation (DOT).  Roadway crashes are among the leading causes of death in the United States, especially among young people. Over the past 10 years, there has been a 25 percent reduction in the number of fatalities on the Nation’s roadways. In 2014, there were a projected 32,675 motor vehicle fatalities. This decline in fatalities shows a continuation in the general trend downward in fatalities that started in 2006.  In fact, the projected 2014 fatality rate of 1.08 per 100 vehicle million miles traveled (VMT) is the lowest ever recorded.</p>
<p>The importance of improving transportation safety is reflected in DOT’s Strategic Plan. The Department strives to make the U.S. transportation system the safest in the world. DOT will work with all of its stakeholders — transportation agencies, elected officials, law enforcement, industry, safety advocates, novice drivers, the disability and older adult communities, and the public — to reduce transportation-related fatalities and injuries and make our roadway system safe for all users.</p>
<p>Progress toward a national roadway safety goal requires collaboration with a diverse group of stakeholders and partners across a range of disciplines.  Within DOT, the relevant operating administrations can leverage the respective resources and expertise to more effectively achieve a safer transportation environment. These organizations include the following:</p>
<ul><li>Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) provides Federal State and local partners the tools, resources, and information necessary to make sound safety investment decisions and coordinates with States to develop Strategic Highway Safety Plans (SHSP) and implement programs that improve the safety of roadway infrastructure on all public roads.</li>
<li>Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) promotes safe commercial motor vehicle (CMV) (large truck and bus) operations through education, innovation, regulation, enforcement, financial assistance, partnerships, and full accountability to reduce crashes, injuries, and fatalities on our Nation’s roadways involving CMVs.</li>
<li>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) develops vehicle safety standards, conducts research on new vehicle safety and technology, and oversees compliance, defect investigations and recalls.  NHTSA equally focuses on driver behavior by developing effective traffic safety programs, providing grant funds to States to implement these programs, and implementing national high visibility enforcement campaigns.</li>
</ul><p>Roadway fatalities impact all road users, including drivers, passengers, pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclists, commercial vehicle operators, and those who work to build and maintain the Nation’s four million miles of roadways. The  Federal government is the only entity that has the authority to establish national safety standards for vehicles, regulate interstate motor carriers, and mandate roadway safety features.</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholders:</strong></p>
<p>FHWA, FMCSA, and NHTSA have formed strategic alliances with partners from a wide array of backgrounds to enhance and forward the Nation’s roadway safety agenda through guidance, technical assistance, and development of resource materials. Many stakeholders currently address transportation safety issues independently, through individual goals, plans, and activities. Some have implemented substantial safety initiatives, and these contributions are vital to maintaining and improving roadway safety. As described in the RSP, involvement by multiple stakeholders provides opportunities for broader public outreach and for the development and implementation of cross-cutting roadway safety strategies reflecting the common interests of many parties.</p>
<p>Each partner offers unique strengths and abilities to assist each mode to deliver its programs and leverage resources in protecting the public on the Nation’s roadways.  Progress toward a national roadway safety goal requires collaboration with a diverse group of stakeholders and partners across a range of disciplines.  The agencies within DOT work with a network of partner organizations, such as State Highway Safety Offices, State transportation departments, Tribal governments, local and county traffic engineers, law enforcement agencies, public health associations, safety advocacy groups, the motorcoach industry, hazardous shipping businesses, interstate trucking operations and the auto industry on the development of evidence-based roadway safety programs, projects, and safety standards.  Such collaboration will help to integrate a broad range of factors affecting roadway safety and create more efficient and effective problem-solving synergies across the transportation industry.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<p>A number of challenges could slow down or even reverse positive trends.  Many States continue to face budget shortfalls and are under tremendous pressure to reduce services, resulting in cut backs to roadway safety programs.  Cutbacks in State, Tribal and local law enforcement agency budgets could weaken national enforcement campaigns and local traffic safety enforcement efforts.  States, Tribes, and local governments must be willing to use data-driven analytical processes to make the best and most effective safety investments.</p>
<p>Distracted driving has emerged as a new threat over the past few years as the rise of portable electronic devices has swiftly expanded.   Moreover, as in-vehicle electronic systems become ever more sophisticated and complex, distracted driving could become an even greater threat if it is not addressed in a manner keeping pace with technological advancements.  In fact, a new report by the Governors' Highway Safety Association (GHSA) cites 50 percent of the US adult population now owning smartphones and the wireless industry reports a subscription penetration rate of 102.2 percent (^1).  Also, as the economy continues to gain momentum, more recreational travel and driving may lead to higher crash rates.  Additionally, safety defects in vehicles that are not addressed in a safe and efficiently manner can lead toward more serious vehicle crashes and injuries.  Finally, the repeal of proven life-saving traffic safety laws at the State level, such as universal motorcycle helmet or primary seat belt laws, could also result in higher injuries and fatalities.  Nevertheless, significant opportunities remain for continued progress in reducing roadway fatalities.  The Department will seek new and innovative ways to serve the American people and keep our roadways safe.</p>
<p>MAP-21, The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (P.L 112-141), was signed into law by President Obama on July 6, 2012.  MAP-21 provides an increase in safety funds available for the Highway Safety Improvement Program along with a focus on performance-based programming.  Implementation of MAP-21 will rely heavily on increased partnership across State agencies with DOT.  Additionally, the shift to performance-based programming may require additional effort on the part of some States.  There are also challenges associated with improving safety with local roads and local agencies with Federal-aid program funds, as well as the capacity and willingness of States to use data-driven and analytical processes to make the best safety infrastructure investments.</p>

By 2050, the U.S. population will likely increase by more than 100 million people. Highway and airport congestion are increasing, with related severe economic and environmental impacts. To address these challenges and strengthen the country’s competitive position in an increasingly global economy, the U.S. Department of Transportation has a comprehensive program to develop high-speed and intercity passenger rail. The Federal Railroad Administration manages an approximately $20 billion grant and loan portfolio focused on:</p>
<ul><li>Building new high-speed rail corridors that expand and fundamentally improve passenger transportation in the geographic regions they serve;</li>
<li>Upgrading existing intercity passenger rail corridors to improve reliability, speed, and frequency of existing services; and</li>
<li>Laying the groundwork, through corridor and state planning, for future high-speed rail services.</li>
</ul><p>For the High-Speed and Intercity Passenger Rail Program, FRA selected 153 projects across the country, with nearly 85 percent of rail investments concentrated in 6 corridors (San Francisco-Los Angeles, Boston-New York City-Washington, D.C., Seattle-Portland-Eugene, Charlotte-Washington, D.C., Chicago-St. Louis, and Chicago-Detroit). These corridors are in five mega-regions, in which about 65 percent of the U.S. population resides and which will likely absorb the bulk of future population growth.</p>
<p>FRA has developed a sophisticated grants management apparatus, laid the foundation for sustainable long-term passenger rail improvements, and strengthened industry capacity to deliver rail projects through technical assistance and strategic initiatives. FRA is strongly committed to robust stakeholder outreach, communication, and collaboration as central components of program management, allowing FRA to identify program improvements, engage in project planning and development, and provide the support necessary for grantees to carry out projects successfully.</p>

                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:<span class="acc_content_label"><p>Air traffic control systems can improve the efficiency of airspace. As of December 2014, ERAM achieved Initial Operation Capability at all 20 Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs).  By March 2015, all 20 Air Route Traffic Control Centers will have achieved Operational Readiness Date (ORD) for ERAM.</p>
<p>The En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) System replaces the 40-year-old En Route HOST Computer System and backup system used at 20 FAA ARTCCs around the country.  ERAM is the main computer system air traffic controllers use to guide airplanes flying at high altitudes.  Air traffic control towers, terminal radar approach control facilities, the Air Traffic Control System Command Center, flight service stations, and other agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense, all connect to and use the information managed by the En Route HOST Computer System.  The original HOST computer software architecture was developed in the late 1960s and was implemented as National Airspace System (NAS) Stage A in the early 1970s.</p>
<p>For controllers, ERAM provides a user-friendly interface with customizable displays.  Trajectory modeling is more accurate than in HOST, allowing maximum airspace use, better conflict detection, and improved decision making.  ERAM will substantially increase the number of flights that can be tracked and displayed to controllers from 1,100 to 1,900.  The ERAM system also provides two functionally identical channels with dual redundancy, providing a more robust back-up capability than today's environment.  Coverage will also extend beyond facility boundaries, enabling controllers to handle additional traffic more efficiently because ERAM is designed to process data from up to 64 radars instead of the current 24.  The ERAM system is needed to replace the current HOST system and allow the FAA to continue to provide the high level of safe, reliable air traffic control services that the nation has come to expect; and also put in place the infrastructure necessary to transition the NAS to NextGen.</p>

</p>
                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:<span class="acc_content_label"><p>Background:</p>
<p>Reducing roadway fatalities continues to be a top priority at the Department of Transportation (DOT).  Roadway crashes are among the leading causes of death in the United States, especially among young people. Over the past 10 years, there has been a 25 percent reduction in the number of fatalities on the Nation’s roadways. In 2014, there were a projected 32,675 motor vehicle fatalities. This decline in fatalities shows a continuation in the general trend downward in fatalities that started in 2006.  In fact, the projected 2014 fatality rate of 1.08 per 100 vehicle million miles traveled (VMT) is the lowest ever recorded.</p>
<p>The importance of improving transportation safety is reflected in DOT’s Strategic Plan. The Department strives to make the U.S. transportation system the safest in the world. DOT will work with all of its stakeholders — transportation agencies, elected officials, law enforcement, industry, safety advocates, novice drivers, the disability and older adult communities, and the public — to reduce transportation-related fatalities and injuries and make our roadway system safe for all users.</p>
<p>Progress toward a national roadway safety goal requires collaboration with a diverse group of stakeholders and partners across a range of disciplines.  Within DOT, the relevant operating administrations can leverage the respective resources and expertise to more effectively achieve a safer transportation environment. These organizations include the following:</p>
<ul><li>Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) provides Federal State and local partners the tools, resources, and information necessary to make sound safety investment decisions and coordinates with States to develop Strategic Highway Safety Plans (SHSP) and implement programs that improve the safety of roadway infrastructure on all public roads.</li>
<li>Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) promotes safe commercial motor vehicle (CMV) (large truck and bus) operations through education, innovation, regulation, enforcement, financial assistance, partnerships, and full accountability to reduce crashes, injuries, and fatalities on our Nation’s roadways involving CMVs.</li>
<li>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) develops vehicle safety standards, conducts research on new vehicle safety and technology, and oversees compliance, defect investigations and recalls.  NHTSA equally focuses on driver behavior by developing effective traffic safety programs, providing grant funds to States to implement these programs, and implementing national high visibility enforcement campaigns.</li>
</ul><p>Roadway fatalities impact all road users, including drivers, passengers, pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclists, commercial vehicle operators, and those who work to build and maintain the Nation’s four million miles of roadways. The  Federal government is the only entity that has the authority to establish national safety standards for vehicles, regulate interstate motor carriers, and mandate roadway safety features.</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholders:</strong></p>
<p>FHWA, FMCSA, and NHTSA have formed strategic alliances with partners from a wide array of backgrounds to enhance and forward the Nation’s roadway safety agenda through guidance, technical assistance, and development of resource materials. Many stakeholders currently address transportation safety issues independently, through individual goals, plans, and activities. Some have implemented substantial safety initiatives, and these contributions are vital to maintaining and improving roadway safety. As described in the RSP, involvement by multiple stakeholders provides opportunities for broader public outreach and for the development and implementation of cross-cutting roadway safety strategies reflecting the common interests of many parties.</p>
<p>Each partner offers unique strengths and abilities to assist each mode to deliver its programs and leverage resources in protecting the public on the Nation’s roadways.  Progress toward a national roadway safety goal requires collaboration with a diverse group of stakeholders and partners across a range of disciplines.  The agencies within DOT work with a network of partner organizations, such as State Highway Safety Offices, State transportation departments, Tribal governments, local and county traffic engineers, law enforcement agencies, public health associations, safety advocacy groups, the motorcoach industry, hazardous shipping businesses, interstate trucking operations and the auto industry on the development of evidence-based roadway safety programs, projects, and safety standards.  Such collaboration will help to integrate a broad range of factors affecting roadway safety and create more efficient and effective problem-solving synergies across the transportation industry.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<p>A number of challenges could slow down or even reverse positive trends.  Many States continue to face budget shortfalls and are under tremendous pressure to reduce services, resulting in cut backs to roadway safety programs.  Cutbacks in State, Tribal and local law enforcement agency budgets could weaken national enforcement campaigns and local traffic safety enforcement efforts.  States, Tribes, and local governments must be willing to use data-driven analytical processes to make the best and most effective safety investments.</p>
<p>Distracted driving has emerged as a new threat over the past few years as the rise of portable electronic devices has swiftly expanded.   Moreover, as in-vehicle electronic systems become ever more sophisticated and complex, distracted driving could become an even greater threat if it is not addressed in a manner keeping pace with technological advancements.  In fact, a new report by the Governors' Highway Safety Association (GHSA) cites 50 percent of the US adult population now owning smartphones and the wireless industry reports a subscription penetration rate of 102.2 percent (^1).  Also, as the economy continues to gain momentum, more recreational travel and driving may lead to higher crash rates.  Additionally, safety defects in vehicles that are not addressed in a safe and efficiently manner can lead toward more serious vehicle crashes and injuries.  Finally, the repeal of proven life-saving traffic safety laws at the State level, such as universal motorcycle helmet or primary seat belt laws, could also result in higher injuries and fatalities.  Nevertheless, significant opportunities remain for continued progress in reducing roadway fatalities.  The Department will seek new and innovative ways to serve the American people and keep our roadways safe.</p>
<p>MAP-21, The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (P.L 112-141), was signed into law by President Obama on July 6, 2012.  MAP-21 provides an increase in safety funds available for the Highway Safety Improvement Program along with a focus on performance-based programming.  Implementation of MAP-21 will rely heavily on increased partnership across State agencies with DOT.  Additionally, the shift to performance-based programming may require additional effort on the part of some States.  There are also challenges associated with improving safety with local roads and local agencies with Federal-aid program funds, as well as the capacity and willingness of States to use data-driven and analytical processes to make the best safety infrastructure investments.</p>

Between 2001 and 2010, an average of 13 people in the United States died every year in incidents related to the transportation of hazardous material—a rate of one death for every 21 billion ton-miles of hazardous material moved.  In addition to causing deaths and injuries, hazardous material transportation incidents disrupt communities when people are evacuated from their homes, business activity is curtailed, and transportation services are interrupted.  We will continue to develop and encourage the use of safety tools - such as improved data collection, risk management practices, and incident response planning - to prevent, mitigate, and respond to hazardous material transportation accidents.</p>
