<p>TSA performs and oversees security operations at the nation’s airports, screening over 650 million passengers annually, to ensure the freedom of movement of people and commerce. In an effort to strengthen aviation security while enhancing the passenger experience, TSA is focusing on risk-based, intelligence-driven security procedures and enhancing its use of technology. Since 2011, the agency has implemented several risk-based initiatives including the TSA Preü™ expedited screening program; the nationwide implementation of modified screening protocols for passengers 12 and younger, passengers 75 and over, and active duty service members; expediting physical screening of Veterans on chartered Honor Flights; and providing modified screening to Wounded Warriors.  A number of initiatives will further enable TSA to reach its goal of expanding expedited screening for known populations in order to focus on those that are unknown including the development and deployment of the TSA Pre✓™ Application and TSA Risk Assessment programs; expansion of  TSA Pre✓™participation to international air carrier; continued expansion of the Known Crewmember program; and developing operational policies, procedures, and other activities such as the evolution of checkpoint screening technologies to support deployment of Risk Assessments that will grow the volume of passengers eligible for expedited screening.</p>
<p>As of December 2013, on a weekly basis, more than 32%  of passengers  receive some form of expedited screening, and TSA expects to continue to grow that number.  While driving the growth of eligible populations is key to the initiative’s long term success, TSA faces challenges in aligning, planning, and executing activities for incorporating these various populations.  The success of achieving TSA’s risk-based security milestones is in many ways reliant upon external and internal partners that TSA continues to work with to mitigate these challenges.</p>

            <h2>Strategies</h2>
            <!--<div class="teaser collapsed">
                                            </div>-->
            <div class="">
                <p>The strategic foundations/underlying premises of risk-based security are as follows:</p>
<p>TSA has deployed an iterative and dynamic approach to pursuing its risk-based security vision by validating components of the strategy through various modeling and simulation tools, proof-of-concept (POC) lab testing, and pilots or assessments in the field. The critical evaluation areas identified for risk-based security include security effectiveness, operational efficiency, and passenger experience.  Data collection and evaluation of specific parameters in these areas provides assurance that the risk-based security initiatives TSA chooses to implement will be operationally effective and suitable in meeting aviation security mission needs and also suitable for operations in the commercial airport environment.  During initiative testing and deployment, TSA works carefully with each impacted airline, airport, and airport authority to ensure achievement of risk-based security goals, common interests, clear identification of logistical issues, and candid discussion of challenges.</p>
<p>TSA considers numerous factors when determining whether an individual or a segment of the traveling population is eligible for expedited physical screening.  When looking to add a new low-risk population, TSA follows a methodical, requirements-based engagement process. Risk-based initiatives that stem from this process range from modifying the standard screening process in support of risk-based security objectives, incorporating new populations into TSA Pre✓™ expedited screening, or real-time threat assessment capabilities such as Managed Inclusion.  Governance and performance oversight is driven by TSA’s Executive Risk Steering Committee, a forum where senior executives ensure strong management and effective alignment of TSA’s risk-based security portfolio of activities.</p>
<p>In keeping with the Department’s commitment to embedding and enforcing privacy protections and transparency in all DHS activities, TSA collects, maintains and discloses information associated with these initiatives in accordance with Federal privacy laws and regulations.   Specifically, TSA published a Privacy Act System of Records Notice and Privacy Impact Assessment on its TSA Pre✓™ and Secure Flight Programs in accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a and the E-Government Act of 2002, respectively.  These public documents serve as mechanisms to provide notification to individuals impacted by these activities and articulate how TSA manages sensitive information entrusted to the agency during risk-based initiatives.  Additionally, TSA regularly briefs privacy advocates and stakeholders on all programs and/or initiatives that raise significant privacy concerns affecting the traveling public.</p>
<p>Specific tactics include:</p>
<ul><li>Implement expedited screening for low risk populations.</li>
</ul><p>As a result of the nationwide deployment of screening protocols for passengers 12 and under, and 75 and older, 5.5% of passengers per day are eligible for expedited screening based on assessed low risk.  As of August 2013 on average 10.5% of travelers, such as members of CBP’s trusted traveler programs, Known Crewmembers and service members of the U.S Armed Forces, receive expedited screening daily.</p>
<ul><li>Foster partnerships with airports and airline to allow for additional entre points for TSA Pre✓™ availability</li>
<li>Continue partnerships with Customs and Border Protection’s Global Entry program to benefit low-risk travelers entering the U.S. and traveling from U.S. airports</li>
<li>Implement a TSA Pre✓™ Application program so that passengers who do not anticipate international travel can apply for acceptance into TSA Pre✓™ for domestic travel.</li>
<li>TSA Pre✓™ has developed partnerships with 40 airports and 7 airlines.  United Airlines, US Airways, American Airlines, Alaska Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Hawaiian Airlines, and Virgin America to offer benefits of TSA Pre✓™ to eligible populations.  Certain frequent flyers and members of CBP's Trusted Traveler programs, including Global Entry, SENTRI, and NEXUS who are U.S. citizens and Canadian citizens in NEXUS may participate.  TSA has performed extensive outreach and marketing with non-traditional stakeholders in the business and travel community to increase participation in Global Entry.</li>
<li>Grow programs that support TSA’s risk-based approach to passenger screening.</li>
</ul><p>As part of its risk-based approach to aviation security, and continuing effort to increase the population of travelers receiving expedited screening, TSA will begin to use its Secure Flight system to identify travelers who may be eligible for expedited screening at airports with TSA Pre✓™ lanes using information already collected and provided to TSA by the airlines. TSA partners with airlines to update the integration of airline and Secure Flight data systems to facilitate low-risk prescreening.  The agency will also implement the TSA Pre✓™ Application program so that passengers who do not anticipate international travel can apply for acceptance into TSA Pre✓™ for domestic travel.</p>
<ul><li>Improve the use of behavior detection and interviewing techniques to strengthen the screening process.                                                                                                    Expand both the breadth and the depth of behavior detection skills in the field, while promoting innovative proofs of concept/tests in the field for new ways to use behavior detection.</li>
<li>Accelerate efforts to optimize screening processes and use of technology to gain system-wide efficiencies.</li>
</ul><p>TSA constantly evaluates new ideas to optimize process and technology through the risk-based security approach.  TSA’s numerous modeling and simulation tools evaluate efficiency improvement ideas in the realms of both expedited screening process and security screening technology.  From such simulations, ideas evolve for proof-of-concepts (POC) TSA tests in a laboratory environment, often with partners from industry and other stakeholders.  Based on the results from such POCs, along with other ideas and lessons learned, TSA conducts small-scale pilots or assessments in the field for new risk-based security initiatives.  TSA then selects successful pilot initiatives for broader-scale deployments.  By managing a dynamic portfolio risk-based security initiatives selected from a large bank of lessons learned, TSA promotes efficiencies across the aviation security system.</p>

            <h2>Progress Update</h2>
            <div>
                <p>Over the past two years, TSA worked to achieve the targets for the measures in this Agency Priority Goal, and in most instances, TSA met or surpassed the goal.  Through ongoing efforts to accelerate efforts to promote enrollment in DHS Trusted Traveler Programs (TTPs) and expand TSA Pre✓® to trusted, pre-vetted populations, TSA has strengthened security at screening checkpoints while simultaneously increasing its operational efficiency and improving the passenger experience.</p>
<p>• On December 4, 2013, TSA implemented the TSA Pre✓® Application Program, permitting U.S. citizens and U.S. lawful permanent residents the opportunity to apply directly to TSA Pre✓®.  To date, 329 enrollment centers—including 37 at 34 airports, and 292 in high-traffic off-airport locations around the country—process, on average, more than 4,600 applications daily.  As of the end of FY 2015, TSA has received more than 1.6 million enrollment applications since the program’s inception.</p>
<p>• TSA has taken policy decisions to extend TSA Pre✓® to members of low risk populations (LRPs), and continues efforts to “onboard” additional federal agencies and departments.  During the reporting period, TSA has extended TSA Pre✓® eligibility to the following LRPs:<br />
o Department of Defense and U.S. Coast Guard civilian employees<br />
o Cadets and midshipmen at the five U.S. service academies<br />
o Department of State Top Secret clearance holders<br />
o TSA employees<br />
o Members of the Aviation Security Advisory Committee, National Fusion Center Association, and The Flag and General Officers’ Network</p>
<p>• To meet the demand from travelers and airports that did not have a dedicated TSA Pre✓® lane, TSA launched an initiative to permit TSA Pre✓®-eligible travelers expedited screening traveling through airports with single-lane checkpoints.</p>
<p>• TSA continues to encourage domestic and foreign air carriers’ participation in TSA Pre✓®.  As of the end of FY 2015, ten U.S. and two foreign carriers (Air Canada and WestJet) participate in TSA Pre✓®.   Currently, more than 86 percent of domestic passengers are flying aboard a TSA Pre✓®-participating carrier.</p>
<p>• The TSA Secure Flight (SF) program enhances the Nation’s transportation system by operating a risk-based, intelligence-driven watch list matching capability.  Using an automated process to match Secure Flight Passenger Data (SFPD) against various watch lists—e.g., No Fly list, Selectee list, Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s Do Not Board list—SF flags travelers who pose a potential risk to transportation, allowing for appropriate mitigating actions to be taken.  SF has successfully vetted 100% of SFPD over the reporting period.</p>
<p>• DHS TRIP has consistently met its processing-time goal by continually improving processes; identifying phases that could be made more efficient and steps that could be eliminated; and conducting pilots of potential process changes that could improve cycle times.  DHS TRIP has made steady and significant improvements in the processing times.</p>
<p>• During the second half of FY 2015, TSA began adjusting the risk posture associated with expedited passenger screening in response both to changes in the threat, and also to recommendations from the DHS Inspector General.  These changes resulted in travelers not directly enrolled in a DHS TTP or members of an LRP having a decreased opportunity to receive expedited screening.</p>
<p>Results<br />
At the end of FY 2015, an average of 810,000 daily travelers (approximately 41 percent of daily travelers) experience expedited screening through one of more than 460 TSA Pre✓® lanes at more than 160 airports across the country.  Of the total expedited screening population, nearly 38 percent were eligible as a result of their enrollment in a DHS TTP or their membership in an approved LRP.  This percentage is an increase from the 25 percent total number of trusted travelers at the end of the first half of FY 2015 and reflects the success of growth in our trusted traveler population—which now exceeds 8 million individuals.</p>

This is a unified approach to watch list matching for covered passenger flights, to avoid unnecessary duplication of watch list matching efforts and resources and reduce the burden on aircraft operators.</p>

The No Fly and Selectee Lists are based on all the records in the TSDB, and represent the subset of names who meet the criteria of the No Fly and Selectee designations. Secure Flight will also match data against additional subsets of the TSDB as determined by Department and Agency leadership This is a unified approach to watch list matching for covered passenger flights, to avoid unnecessary duplication of watch list matching efforts and resources and reduce the burden on aircraft operators.</p>

Although the U.S. Government’s counterterrorism efforts have degraded the ability of al-Qa’ida’s senior leadership in Afghanistan and Pakistan to centrally plan and execute sophisticated external attacks, since 2009 we have seen the rise of al-Qa’ida affiliates, such as al-Qa’ida in the Arabian Peninsula and the al-Nusrah Front in Syria. These groups have made attempts to export terrorism to our Nation. Additionally, we face the threat of domestic-based "lone offenders" and those who are inspired by violent extremist ideologies to radicalize and commit acts of terrorism against Americans and the Nation. These threats come in multiple forms and, because of the nature of independent actors, may be hardest to detect.</p>
<p>We will pursue the following strategies to prevent terrorist attacks:</p>
<ul><li><em>Analyze, fuse, and disseminate terrorism information </em>by sharing information with, and utilizing threat analysis alongside, stakeholders across the homeland security enterprise.  We remain committed to integrating critical data sources, such as those for biometric data, by consolidating or federating screening and vetting operations. We will also continually increase and integrate domain awareness capabilities, as well as improve our ability to fully utilize vast amounts of intelligence and other information—the so-called "big data" challenge—while rigorously protecting privacy and civil rights and civil liberties.</li>
<li><em>Deter and disrupt operations </em>by leveraging the intelligence, information sharing, technological, operational, and policy-making elements within DHS to facilitate a cohesive and coordinated operational response. We will also develop intelligence sources and leverage research and analysis to identify and illustrate the tactics, behaviors, and indicators potentially associated with violent extremism as well as factors that may influence violent extremism, and jointly develop with federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial partners training for frontline law enforcement officers on behaviors that may be telling regarding violent extremist activity.</li>
<li><em>Strengthen transportation security </em>by using a multi-layered risk-based approach to detect malicious actors and dangerous items at various entry and exit points in the travel and trade system. We will also improve coordination with foreign governments and stakeholders to expand pre-departure screening and enhance transportation security operations among willing partners to mitigate risks from overseas.</li>
<li><em>Counter violent extremism </em>by: 1) supporting community-community-based problem solving and integration efforts, as well as local law enforcement programs; and 2) working with our partners to share information with frontline law enforcement partners, communities, families, and the private sector about how violent extremists are using the Internet and how to protect themselves and their communities.</li>

</p>
                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats are enduring areas of concern. The consequences of these attacks are potentially high even though the likelihood of their occurrence is relatively low. Small scale chemical attacks are expected to remain more likely because the relative lack of specialized skills and knowledge required to conduct such attacks. However, nuclear terrorism and bioterrorism pose the most strategically significant risk because of their potential consequences. Although the difficulty of stealing a nuclear weapon or fabricating one from stolen or diverted weapons materials reduces the likelihood of this type of attack, the extremely high consequences of an improvised nuclear device attack make it an ongoing top homeland security risk.</p>
<p>We will pursue the following strategies to prevent and protect against the unauthorized acquisition or use of chemical biological, radiological, and nuclear materials and capabilities:</p>
<ul><li><em>Anticipate chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear emerging threats </em>by identifying and understanding potentially dangerous actors, technologies, and materials, and prioritizing research and development activities including: 1) analyses of alternative technology options; 2) assessments of complex issues such as the relative risk of different chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats; 3) experimentation and operational test and evaluation of technologies proposed for acquisition; 4) detailed technical characterization of potential biological threat organisms; 5) the creation of consensus standards that enable cost-effective progress across many fields; and 6) the determination of nuclear material characteristics through nuclear forensics techniques.</li>
<li><em>Identify and interdict unlawful acquisition and movement of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear precursors and materials </em>by leveraging investigative and enforcement assets towards domestic and international movement of these materials and by engaging in information sharing with all stakeholders to monitor and control this technology.</li>
<li><em>Detect, locate, and prevent the hostile use of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear materials and weapons </em>by 1) combining authorities and assets with other departments and agencies; 2) building the U.S. Government’s global nuclear detection capability through the Global Nuclear Detection Architecture, a framework for detecting (through technical and non-technical means), analyzing, and reporting on nuclear and other radioactive materials that are out of regulatory control; 3) advancing nuclear forensics capabilities in order to close down nuclear smuggling networks, promote global nuclear security, and deter would-be nation state terrorist facilitators from transferring nuclear materials to terrorists; 4) providing unimpeachable forensic data for use by law enforcement authorities in the investigation and prosecution of crimes involving biological agents; 5) regulating high-risk chemical facilities to ensure that they take proper steps to mitigate risks; and 6) preventing the occurrence of significant biological incidents, where possible, but, when unable to prevent, stopping them from overwhelming the capacity of our state, local, tribal, and territorial partners to manage and respond. To this last point, DHS will deploy technologies that enable early detection of biological agents prior to the onset of symptoms, pursue more rapid responder capabilities, and increase the capacity and effectiveness of local public health, medical, and emergency services.</li>

<p>We will pursue the following strategies to reduce risk to the nation’s critical infrastructure, key leadership, and events:</p>
<ul><li><em>Enhance security for the Nation’s critical infrastructure from terrorism and criminal activity </em>by 1) identifying critical infrastructure and related vulnerabilities; 2) developing and deploying a scalable assessment methodology depending on the level of threat and the nature of the target; 3) inserting and/or developing appropriate technologies; 4) tracking protective measures of our partners across the homeland security enterprise; and 5) conducting investigations that maximize disruption of criminal enterprises that pose the greatest risk to the United States. We will also enhance the Nation’s ability to counter improvise explosive devices (IEDs) by coordinating whole community efforts to prevent, protect against, respond to, and mitigate terrorist and criminal use of explosives.</li>
<li><em>Protect key leaders, facilities, and National Special Security Events </em>by 1) working with partners across the homeland security enterprise to coordinate intelligence, information sharing, security, and response resources; 2) protecting the President, the Vice President, visiting heads of state, major Presidential candidates, and other designated protectees; 3) protecting federal facilities, employees, and visitors; and 4) assessing risk and coordinating support to partners during major special events across the Nation through the Special Events Assessment Rating.</li>

</p>
                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><div>
<p>TSA performs and oversees security operations at the nation’s airports, screening over 650 million passengers annually, to ensure the freedom of movement of people and commerce. In an effort to strengthen aviation security while enhancing the passenger experience, TSA is focusing on risk-based, intelligence-driven security procedures and enhancing its use of technology. Since 2011, the agency has implemented several risk-based initiatives including the TSA Preü™ expedited screening program; the nationwide implementation of modified screening protocols for passengers 12 and younger, passengers 75 and over, and active duty service members; expediting physical screening of Veterans on chartered Honor Flights; and providing modified screening to Wounded Warriors.  A number of initiatives will further enable TSA to reach its goal of expanding expedited screening for known populations in order to focus on those that are unknown including the development and deployment of the TSA Pre✓™ Application and TSA Risk Assessment programs; expansion of  TSA Pre✓™participation to international air carrier; continued expansion of the Known Crewmember program; and developing operational policies, procedures, and other activities such as the evolution of checkpoint screening technologies to support deployment of Risk Assessments that will grow the volume of passengers eligible for expedited screening.</p>
<p>As of December 2013, on a weekly basis, more than 32%  of passengers  receive some form of expedited screening, and TSA expects to continue to grow that number.  While driving the growth of eligible populations is key to the initiative’s long term success, TSA faces challenges in aligning, planning, and executing activities for incorporating these various populations.  The success of achieving TSA’s risk-based security milestones is in many ways reliant upon external and internal partners that TSA continues to work with to mitigate these challenges.</p>

Additionally, we face the threat of domestic-based "lone offenders" and those who are inspired by violent extremist ideologies to radicalize and commit acts of terrorism against Americans and the Nation. These threats come in multiple forms and, because of the nature of independent actors, may be hardest to detect.</p>
<p>We will pursue the following strategies to prevent terrorist attacks:</p>
<ul><li><em>Analyze, fuse, and disseminate terrorism information </em>by sharing information with, and utilizing threat analysis alongside, stakeholders across the homeland security enterprise.  We remain committed to integrating critical data sources, such as those for biometric data, by consolidating or federating screening and vetting operations. We will also continually increase and integrate domain awareness capabilities, as well as improve our ability to fully utilize vast amounts of intelligence and other information—the so-called "big data" challenge—while rigorously protecting privacy and civil rights and civil liberties.</li>
<li><em>Deter and disrupt operations </em>by leveraging the intelligence, information sharing, technological, operational, and policy-making elements within DHS to facilitate a cohesive and coordinated operational response. We will also develop intelligence sources and leverage research and analysis to identify and illustrate the tactics, behaviors, and indicators potentially associated with violent extremism as well as factors that may influence violent extremism, and jointly develop with federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial partners training for frontline law enforcement officers on behaviors that may be telling regarding violent extremist activity.</li>
<li><em>Strengthen transportation security </em>by using a multi-layered risk-based approach to detect malicious actors and dangerous items at various entry and exit points in the travel and trade system. We will also improve coordination with foreign governments and stakeholders to expand pre-departure screening and enhance transportation security operations among willing partners to mitigate risks from overseas.</li>
<li><em>Counter violent extremism </em>by: 1) supporting community-community-based problem solving and integration efforts, as well as local law enforcement programs; and 2) working with our partners to share information with frontline law enforcement partners, communities, families, and the private sector about how violent extremists are using the Internet and how to protect themselves and their communities.</li>

<p>TSA performs and oversees security operations at the nation’s airports, screening over 650 million passengers annually, to ensure the freedom of movement of people and commerce. In an effort to strengthen aviation security while enhancing the passenger experience, TSA is focusing on risk-based, intelligence-driven security procedures and enhancing its use of technology. Since 2011, the agency has implemented several risk-based initiatives including the TSA Preü™ expedited screening program; the nationwide implementation of modified screening protocols for passengers 12 and younger, passengers 75 and over, and active duty service members; expediting physical screening of Veterans on chartered Honor Flights; and providing modified screening to Wounded Warriors.  A number of initiatives will further enable TSA to reach its goal of expanding expedited screening for known populations in order to focus on those that are unknown including the development and deployment of the TSA Pre✓™ Application and TSA Risk Assessment programs; expansion of  TSA Pre✓™participation to international air carrier; continued expansion of the Known Crewmember program; and developing operational policies, procedures, and other activities such as the evolution of checkpoint screening technologies to support deployment of Risk Assessments that will grow the volume of passengers eligible for expedited screening.</p>
<p>As of December 2013, on a weekly basis, more than 32%  of passengers  receive some form of expedited screening, and TSA expects to continue to grow that number.  While driving the growth of eligible populations is key to the initiative’s long term success, TSA faces challenges in aligning, planning, and executing activities for incorporating these various populations.  The success of achieving TSA’s risk-based security milestones is in many ways reliant upon external and internal partners that TSA continues to work with to mitigate these challenges.</p>

</p>
                        <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats are enduring areas of concern. The consequences of these attacks are potentially high even though the likelihood of their occurrence is relatively low. Small scale chemical attacks are expected to remain more likely because the relative lack of specialized skills and knowledge required to conduct such attacks. However, nuclear terrorism and bioterrorism pose the most strategically significant risk because of their potential consequences. Although the difficulty of stealing a nuclear weapon or fabricating one from stolen or diverted weapons materials reduces the likelihood of this type of attack, the extremely high consequences of an improvised nuclear device attack make it an ongoing top homeland security risk.</p>
<p>We will pursue the following strategies to prevent and protect against the unauthorized acquisition or use of chemical biological, radiological, and nuclear materials and capabilities:</p>
<ul><li><em>Anticipate chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear emerging threats </em>by identifying and understanding potentially dangerous actors, technologies, and materials, and prioritizing research and development activities including: 1) analyses of alternative technology options; 2) assessments of complex issues such as the relative risk of different chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats; 3) experimentation and operational test and evaluation of technologies proposed for acquisition; 4) detailed technical characterization of potential biological threat organisms; 5) the creation of consensus standards that enable cost-effective progress across many fields; and 6) the determination of nuclear material characteristics through nuclear forensics techniques.</li>
<li><em>Identify and interdict unlawful acquisition and movement of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear precursors and materials </em>by leveraging investigative and enforcement assets towards domestic and international movement of these materials and by engaging in information sharing with all stakeholders to monitor and control this technology.</li>
<li><em>Detect, locate, and prevent the hostile use of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear materials and weapons </em>by 1) combining authorities and assets with other departments and agencies; 2) building the U.S. Government’s global nuclear detection capability through the Global Nuclear Detection Architecture, a framework for detecting (through technical and non-technical means), analyzing, and reporting on nuclear and other radioactive materials that are out of regulatory control; 3) advancing nuclear forensics capabilities in order to close down nuclear smuggling networks, promote global nuclear security, and deter would-be nation state terrorist facilitators from transferring nuclear materials to terrorists; 4) providing unimpeachable forensic data for use by law enforcement authorities in the investigation and prosecution of crimes involving biological agents; 5) regulating high-risk chemical facilities to ensure that they take proper steps to mitigate risks; and 6) preventing the occurrence of significant biological incidents, where possible, but, when unable to prevent, stopping them from overwhelming the capacity of our state, local, tribal, and territorial partners to manage and respond. To this last point, DHS will deploy technologies that enable early detection of biological agents prior to the onset of symptoms, pursue more rapid responder capabilities, and increase the capacity and effectiveness of local public health, medical, and emergency services.</li>

DHS reduces risk across a wide portfolio of activities, including the agriculture and food sector, the travel and trade system, and the financial services sector. These systems are vulnerable to criminal exploitation and both physical and cyber-attacks. DHS also maintains constant guard over key leaders and during high-profile events, reducing the possibility that these events could be exploited by criminal or terrorist actors.</p>
<p>We will pursue the following strategies to reduce risk to the nation’s critical infrastructure, key leadership, and events:</p>
<ul><li><em>Enhance security for the Nation’s critical infrastructure from terrorism and criminal activity </em>by 1) identifying critical infrastructure and related vulnerabilities; 2) developing and deploying a scalable assessment methodology depending on the level of threat and the nature of the target; 3) inserting and/or developing appropriate technologies; 4) tracking protective measures of our partners across the homeland security enterprise; and 5) conducting investigations that maximize disruption of criminal enterprises that pose the greatest risk to the United States. We will also enhance the Nation’s ability to counter improvise explosive devices (IEDs) by coordinating whole community efforts to prevent, protect against, respond to, and mitigate terrorist and criminal use of explosives.</li>
<li><em>Protect key leaders, facilities, and National Special Security Events </em>by 1) working with partners across the homeland security enterprise to coordinate intelligence, information sharing, security, and response resources; 2) protecting the President, the Vice President, visiting heads of state, major Presidential candidates, and other designated protectees; 3) protecting federal facilities, employees, and visitors; and 4) assessing risk and coordinating support to partners during major special events across the Nation through the Special Events Assessment Rating.</li>
