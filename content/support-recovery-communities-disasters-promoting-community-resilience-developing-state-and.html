                  <div>
                      <p>On June 22, 2015, HUD Secretary Julián Castro invited 40 states and communities to compete in the second and final phase of the National Disaster Resilience Competition.<a href="support-recovery-communities-disasters-promoting-community-resilience-developing-state-and.html#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a> These finalists—representing areas that experienced a Presidentially-declared major disaster in 2011, 2012, and 2013—will compete for almost $1 billion in funding for disaster recovery and long-term community resilience. From June to October, finalists developed their disaster resilience strategies and proposed specific projects. Through a unique partnership, The Rockefeller Foundation convened an interdisciplinary team of experts to help teams refine their proposals. HUD will announce the winners of Phase 2 in early 2016.</p>
<p>In addition, HUD’s Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes (OLHCHH) released the Healthy Homes Disaster Recovery Toolkit as part of their commitment under the Climate Change Adaptation Plan. This toolkit provides a wealth of resources for multiple stakeholders to develop healthy homes following a disaster.</p>
<p>HUD fell short of its FY 2015 goal of having 40 percent of HUD Climate Change Adaption Plans completed by the end of the fiscal year. Many of the actions proposed in the 2014 Climate Change Adaptation Plan were dependent on the availability of additional staff or contract resources. Given current constraints, the remaining actions will be prioritized  and constrained with limited existing resources.</p>

However, for too long and for too many people, access to opportunity is still not within reach. Americans all want the same basic things for their families: a safe, affordable place to call home, a quality education for our kids, and access to transportation, jobs, retail, and services. Despite genuine progress and a landscape of communities transformed in the more than 40 years since the Fair Housing Act was enacted, the ZIP code in which a child grows up, all too often, remains a strong predictor of that child’s success. To this end, HUD seeks to significantly increase the number of housing providers, lenders, members of the real estate community, and others that fully comply with the Fair Housing Act and other applicable fair housing and civil rights laws and do not discriminate on any basis prohibited by those laws and regulations. While housing discrimination still takes on blatant forms in some instances, it has become more subtle through the years, resulting in under¬reporting and complicating effective enforcement. </p>
<p>In addition to enforcement, HUD works proactively to make access to important neighborhood assets measurably fairer in neighborhoods where HUD invests, and to ensure that policies and practices are in place to provide equal access to persons with disabilities.</p>

The residential sector is responsible for fully 21 percent of the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions.  With approximately 5.5 million housing units assisted through its rental assistance programs, HUD’s share of this total is significant. HUD spends an estimated $6.4 billion annually on utilities (both water and energy) in the form of allowances for tenant-paid utilities, direct operating grants for public housing, and housing assistance payments for privately-owned assisted housing. Utility costs account for around 22 percent of public housing operating budgets, and a similar share in the assisted housing sector. </p>
<p>Reducing these rising costs—generating savings for residents and owners, as well as for taxpayers—is a key HUD priority. Significant progress has been made over the past five years with energy retrofits, healthy housing interventions, or new energy projects completed in more than 510,000 housing units. </p>
<p>In FY 2016-17, HUD will continue or expand energy investments in the residential sector to support the goals of President Obama’s Climate Action Plan to cut energy waste in half by 2030 and accelerate clean energy leadership—both in HUD-assisted housing, as well as in market-rate housing. We will reduce barriers to financing energy efficiency as well as on-site renewable energy generation, help unlock innovative and traditional sources of capital, and strengthen codes and standards that promote energy efficiency and healthy housing.</p>
<p>The need to retrofit HUD-assisted housing is not limited to the efforts to increase energy efficiency and reduce costs. Housing is also an important determinant of health, and poor housing conditions are associated with a wide range of health conditions, including respiratory infections, asthma, lead poisoning, and injuries. HUD makes homes healthy and safe through several programs, led by the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes’ (OLHCHH) lead hazard control grant programs and Lead Safe Housing Rule (LSHR) compliance. OLHCHH also educates the general public about healthy homes through a public communications campaign to help people connect the dots between their health and their home. </p>
<p>The production of lead-safe housing units will continue to depend strongly on the level of funding for the lead hazard control grant programs and the rehabilitation programs that make required lead hazard reduction measures in assisted housing covered by the LSHR. With funding for OLHCHH grant activities projected to be approximately level through FY 2016, and the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and Home Investment Partnership Program (HOME) experiencing significant funding reductions in recent years, the number of pre-1978 housing units made lead-safe in 2016 is expected to decrease.</p>

This effort is consistent with the goals and objectives of Presidential Policy Directive / PPD-8 (National Preparedness) and Executive Order 13653 (Preparing the United States for the Impacts of Climate Change). Over the next five years, HUD will continue to support and expand programs and initiatives designed to increase and enhance pre-planning, research, infrastructure investment, partnerships, and cross-cutting coordination related to disaster response, recovery, and resilience. This work will involve the combined efforts of HUD’s program offices and federal, state, local, and private sector partners and will incorporate HUD’s civil rights, energy, environment, and diversity goals and responsibilities.</p>

The residential sector is responsible for fully 21 percent of the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions.<a href="file:///J:/Performance%20Management/APP%20APR%20AFR/FY16APP%20FY14APR/Departmental%20Clearance%20edits/January%20Clearance/HUD%202016%20APP%202014%20APR_POST-CLEARANCE_edits%20to%20incorporate%20after%20DepSec%20Comments.docx#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a> HUD spends an estimated $6.4 billion annually on utilities (both water and energy) in the form of allowances for tenant-paid utilities, direct operating grants for public housing, and housing assistance payments for privately-owned assisted housing. Utility costs account for around 22 percent of public housing operating budgets, and a similar share in the assisted housing sector.</p>
<p>Reducing these rising costs—generating savings for residents and owners, as well as for taxpayers—is a key HUD priority. Housing is also an important determinant of health, and poor housing conditions are associated with a wide range of health conditions, including respiratory infections, asthma, lead poisoning, injuries, and other housing-related health hazards. Significant progress has been made over the past five years with completed energy retrofits, healthy housing interventions, or new energy projects in more than 460,000 housing units.</p>
<p>From 2014–2018, HUD aims to continue to focus on energy and health investments in the residential sector, both in HUD-assisted housing, as well as in market-rate housing, to support the goals of President Obama’s Climate Action Plan to cut energy waste in half by 2030 and accelerate clean energy leadership. We will reduce barriers to financing energy efficiency as well as on-site renewable energy, help unlock innovative and traditional sources of capital, and raise the bar on codes and standards that promote energy efficiency and healthy housing.</p>
<p>The production of lead-safe housing units will continue to depend strongly on the level of funding for the lead hazard control grant programs and the rehabilitation programs that make require lead hazard reduction measures in housing being assisted. With funding for Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes grant activities projected to be approximately level through FY 2015, and the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and Home Investment Program (HOME) experiencing significant reductions in recent years, the number of pre-1978 housing units made lead-safe in 2015 and 2016 is expected to decrease.</p>
