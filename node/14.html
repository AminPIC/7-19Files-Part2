                        <p>Social Security is America’s most valued and successful domestic program.  Our mission is to “Deliver Social Security services that meet the changing needs of the public.”  Our challenge is to maintain and even improve services in a time of fiscal austerity.  Our statutory mandates have never been as complex, and our workloads have never been as great. Hard times require hard choices; we accept that we will not be able to live up to all expectations, even our own. Our strategic plan lays out what we realistically think we can do and why.</p>

                        <p>Few government agencies reach as many people as we do. The programs we administer provide a financial safety net for millions of Americans. We run one of the Nation’s largest entitlement programs - the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance program. We also administer the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, which provides financial support to aged, blind, or disabled adults and children with limited income and resources. In FY 2011, we paid over 60 million people a total of about $770 billion in Social Security benefits and SSI payments.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For more information on all of our programs and benefits, please visit our Understanding the Benefits web page at <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/10024.html">www.ssa.gov/pubs/10024.html</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our current organization is composed of over 80,000 Federal and State employees. We deliver services through a nationwide network of 1,500 offices that includes regional offices, field offices (including Social Security card centers), teleservice centers, processing centers, hearing offices (including satellite offices and national hearing centers), the Appeals Council, and our headquarters in Baltimore, Maryland. We also have a presence in several United States embassies around the globe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our field offices and Social Security card centers are the primary points of contact for in-person interaction with the public. Our teleservice centers primarily handle telephone calls to our National 800 Number. Employees in our processing centers primarily handle Social Security retirement, survivors, and disability payments but also perform a wide range of other functions, which include answering telephone calls to our National 800 Number. We depend on State employees in 54 State and territorial disability determination services to make disability determinations. The administrative law judges in our hearing offices and the Appeals Council make decisions on appeals of denied Social Security and SSI claims. The vast majority of our employees serve the public directly or provide support to employees who do. A chart illustrating our organizational structure and the function of each component is available on our website at <a href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/org">www.socialsecurity.gov/org</a>.</p>

<div class="intro_text">
<p>Established by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goals are a tool used to accelerate progress on a limited number of priority areas where implementation requires active collaboration between multiple agencies, overcoming organizational barriers to achieve better performance than one agency can achieve on its own.</p>
<p>Set or revised at least every four years, CAP Goals include outcome-oriented goals that cover a limited number of crosscutting policy areas as well as management goals focused on management improvements across the Federal Government in areas of financial management, strategic human capital management, information technology management, procurement and acquisition management, and real property management.</p>
<p>A series of 16 CAP Goals were announced in the 2015 Budget with clearly named accountable officials, data-driven reviews that incorporated a broad range of quantitative and qualitative inputs, and reporting to the public through a common website as a framework to drive performance improvements on cross-government collaboration and tackle government-wide management challenges affecting most agencies.</p>

<p>On June 30, 2016, the President signed into law the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 – nearly 50 years after President Johnson signed the original FOIA into law.  This critical legislation reflects the progress made by the Administration, codifies a number of openness and transparency principles, and ensures that the Administration’s track record of openness is institutionalized throughout government and carries forward for years to come.  Concurrent with the signing of the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, the White House released a Fact Sheet committing the Administration to:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Utilizing the Chief FOIA Officers Council and FOIA Advisory Committee to address FOIA’s greatest challenges;</p>

</div>  </div>  
  <div class="views-field views-field-field-cag-overview-revision-id">    <span class="views-label views-label-field-cag-overview-revision-id">Overview: </span>    <div class="field-content"><p>On March 19, 2015, the President issued Executive Order 13693, <em>Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade</em>, which set forth ambitious climate, energy, and environmental sustainability goals for Federal agencies over the next decade.  Executive departments and agencies have been among our Nation’s leaders as the United States works to build a clean energy economy that will sustain our prosperity and the health of our people and our environment for generations to come. Federal leadership in energy, environmental water, transportation fleets, buildings, and acquisition management will continue to drive national greenhouse gas reductions and support preparations for the impacts of climate change. The Federal Government has the opportunity to significantly reduce direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2025, while at the same time fostering innovation, reducing spending, and strengthening the communities in which our Federal facilities operate. </p>
<p>Employing this strategy for the next decade calls for expanded and updated Federal environmental performance goals with a clear overarching objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions across Federal operations and the Federal supply chain.  Goals for greenhouse gas emissions reduction (40% by 2025), renewable electricity (30% by 2025), clean energy (25% by 2025), and performance contracting ($4 billion in awarded contracts by Dec. 2016) are already well established in the Federal community. The enhanced target for each of these goals will require agencies to sharpen their focus on achieving the goals through existing mechanisms and new technologies that enhance efficiency and use of clean energy.</p>
<p>CEQ and OMB have worked closely to ensure that Federal agencies understand the necessary steps to pursuing the new environmental sustainability goals and those efforts are supported by an interagency Steering Committee.  Pursuit of these sustainability goals will involve at least 25 of the largest Federal agencies. Success will be greatly enhanced by the cross-cutting nature of the goals and the similarity in the tools and procedures used for implementation.</p>
<p>While all Federal agencies have an important role to play in ensuring the Government meets its energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets, key delivery agencies include: The General Services Administration, Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Energy, National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Department of Homeland Security.</p>

In the wake of increasing threats and incidents, the President directed a series of reviews to examine current security, suitability/fitness, and credentialing processes and to recommend areas in need of reform. The interagency reviews identified problem areas and made specific recommendations, which were approved by the Performance Accountability Council (PAC). The PAC developed the Strategic Intent to build upon these efforts and create a lasting impact by providing overarching strategic direction to personnel security, suitability/fitness, and credentialing reform efforts for the next five years.  </p>
<p>The Strategic Intent represents our framework for sustaining progress mandated by the February 2014 Suitability and Security Processes Review Report to the President, the January 2016 PAC Review of Background Investigations, relevant legislation, and other key drivers. It builds on progress since the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 and the subsequent, significant reform efforts that resulted in greater standardization and alignment of suitability and security processes. Through this framework, the PAC will work with other members of the Executive Branch to drive continuous process improvement to personnel security, suitability/fitness, and credentialing programs and address evolving threats. While we cannot eliminate risk altogether, it is imperative that we work across disciplines to maximize our collective efforts to mitigate the risks we face, while ensuring appropriate protections for privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. We must ensure measures to improve these programs avoid imposing unreasonable burdens on the Federal workforce that could negatively impact operations. Therefore, the Federal Government will pursue a balanced approach by addressing the risks posed by personnel who could do significant harm by virtue of the nature of their position.</p>
<p>These reforms will further support ongoing Insider Threat Program implementation by providing earlier detection and improving the quality of vetting. The improved attention to cybersecurity will reinforce efforts to protect sensitive mission data, including personally-identifiable information. </p>

According to AT Kearney’s Foreign Direct Investment Confidence Index, confidence in the U.S. as a location for FDI is high, ranking as the top destination for investment ahead of China, Brazil, Canada, and India.<sup>1 </sup>The U.S. remains the world’s largest economy and is also the largest recipient of foreign direct investment in the world. Over the last ten years, U.S. affiliates of foreign companies have employed more than five million workers, the majority of which are high-paying manufacturing jobs. On average, jobs created by FDI in United States pay up to 30% more.<sup>2</sup>  However, due to global capital mobility and increased foreign competition, we need to take steps to maintain and grow our share of global investment.</p>
<p>Historically, we have left our states and cities to compete for investments with a country’s investment promotion agency, limiting our opportunities to clearly demonstrate our commitment to attracting investment and to leverage our advantages as a top destination for investment. In 2011, through Executive Order, the U.S. launched SelectUSA, the first Federal effort to promote and facilitate inbound business investment. The E.O. created the Interagency Investment Working Group (IIWG) to further design and implement the first-ever coordinated U.S. investment promotion authority. As a driver for success, the global investment team, consisting of both SelectUSA headquarters in DC and investment teams at posts led by Ambassadors, will increase the number of active investment cases touched to encourage business investments.</p>
<p>At the first SelectUSA Investment Summit in Oct 31-Nov. 1 2013, the President reformed SelectUSA, creating a number of firsts: for the first time there will be a clear system for advocacy for high-priority, job-creating investments, driven by the most senior Administration officials all the way up to the President; for the first time there will be a single point of contact for ready investors looking to bring jobs and production to the U.S.; lastly, the Administration is engaging in unprecedented coordinated support for states and localities to attract investment.</p>
<p>Key contributing agencies to the Job-Creating Investment CAP goal include the Department of Commerce, Small Business Administration, US Department of Agriculture, Department of State, Department of Homeland Security, and Export-Import Bank of the U.S.</p>

Over time, the process and legal requirements for the permitting and review of major infrastructure projects have developed in a siloed and ad-hoc way, creating complex processes that in some cases have taken years or longer to complete.  Although there are several reasons why a major infrastructure project may be delayed (including applicant funding uncertainty and state and local reviews), over the past three years the Administration has undertaken an ambitious effort to modernize the Federal government’s role in permitting and review processes.</p>
<p>To ensure his Administration took action to modernize these permitting and review processes, on March 22, 2012, the President signed Executive Order 13604, Improving Performance of Federal Permitting and Review of Infrastructure Projects and subsequently a Presidential Memorandum on May 17, 2013, charging an interagency Steering Committee to lead the development of a plan to turn best practices into standard practice.  This Implementation Plan identifies four strategies, 15 reforms, and nearly 100 both near-term and long-term milestones.  The strategies are:</p>
<ul><li>Strategy 1: Institutionalize Interagency Coordination and Transparency, by formalizing interagency coordination policies, including early identification of a lead agency; synchronizing Federal review and permitting processes and decisions; standardizing the use of the Infrastructure Permitting Dashboard; and identifying best practices for early engagement with State, Local and Tribal governments.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Strategy 2:  Improve Project Planning, Siting, and Application Quality by developing tools to assist project applicants in planning for a major infrastructure project and support effective and timely decision-making by agency staff once the Federal processes begins. </li>
</ul><ul><li>Strategy 3: Improve Permitting Reviews and Mitigation by supporting agency staff in effectively implementing existing regulations, policies, and guidance as well as identifying barriers. This strategy also includes policies to facilitate advance planning for the mitigation of project impacts and landscape- or watershed-level approaches to mitigation, where appropriate.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Strategy 4: Drive Continued Improvement.  Fully implementing these actions and achieving the President’s goal will require a team dedicated to implementing the reforms on an interagency basis, further analyze agency processes, and identify additional reforms.  This strategy includes a proposal to establish a dedicated interagency team to support the ongoing improvement of Federal permitting and review responsibilities for major infrastructure projects.  In addition, this strategy includes a proposal to develop reliable metrics to track timeframes and outcomes for communities and the environment.</li>

Advances in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) have long been central to our Nation’s ability to manufacture better and smarter products, improve health care, develop cleaner and more efficient domestic energy sources, preserve the environment, safeguard national security, and grow the economy. For the United States to maintain its preeminent position in the world it will be essential that the Nation continues to lead in STEM, but evidence indicates that current educational pathways are not leading to a sufficiently large and well-trained STEM workforce to achieve this goal, nor is the U.S. education system cultivating a culture of STEM education necessary for a STEM-literate public. Thus it is essential that the United States enhance U.S. students’ engagement in STEM disciplines and inspire and equip many more students to excel in STEM fields.</p>
<p>A number of Federal agencies place a high priority on STEM education and have developed education initiatives unique to their agency’s mission, needs, and resources.  To better leverage Federal assets, expertise, and partnerships toward a goal of national importance, a cross agency priority to improve STEM education has been developed to increase agency coordination and use of evidence-based approaches to improve P-12 STEM instruction, increase and sustain youth and public engagement in STEM, enhance the STEM experience of undergraduate students, better serve groups historically underrepresented in STEM fields, design graduate education for tomorrow’s STEM workforce, build new models for leveraging assets and expertise, and build and use evidence-based approaches. </p>

</div>  </div>  
  <div class="views-field views-field-field-cag-overview-revision-id">    <span class="views-label views-label-field-cag-overview-revision-id">Overview: </span>    <div class="field-content"><p>The American people deserve a Government that is responsive to their needs. Citizens and businesses expect government services to be well-designed, efficient, and generally comparable to the services they receive from leading private sector organizations. Whether they call the IRS for an answer to a tax question or visit a Social Security Administration office to adjust their benefits, they should experience high-quality interactions with the Federal Government. Despite some important strides to improve customer service over the past fifteen years, too often many Federal Government services fail to meet the expectations of citizens and business, creating unnecessary hassle and cost for citizens, businesses, and the government itself.  The Federal Government must keep pace with the public’s expectations and transform its customer services – soliciting regular customer feedback, streamlining processes, and delivering consistent quality service across customer channels.</p>
<p>To that end, in April 2011 the President issued an<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/27/executive-order-streamlining-service-delivery-and-improving-customer-ser" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/27/executive-order-streamlining-service-delivery-and-improving-customer-ser">Executive Order</a> requiring each agency to develop a customer service plan that identified implementation steps for their customer service activities, including a "signature initiative" that uses technology to improve the customer experience. Agencies posted the plans on their Open Government websites in October 2011, and this goal will build on these plans to streamline and improve customer service delivery.</p>
<p>To build upon the progress being made by individual agencies, the Administration is taking action to deliver improved customer service across the Federal enterprise.  The Administration will:</p>
<ul><li><em>Streamline transactions.</em>  Too often the processes and procedures of government have been developed piecemeal over time, and have not been regularly reexamined to ensure they are designed with the user experience in mind.  The Administration will identify transactions with a high impact on a significant number of citizens and streamline processes, better meet customer needs, and use performance measures to improve services.  This includes areas such as TSA security screening, veterans’ pension and disability applications, income-based repayment of student loans, Social Security, and taxpayer assistance.</li>
<li><em>Develop standards for high impact services.</em>  Citizen expectations for government services are continually increasing, driven by improvements in technology and the high quality services provided by the private sector.  Government leaders have a responsibility to understand customer expectations and service needs, and continually evaluate and improve their effectiveness in meeting those needs.  To facilitate this, many government programs that provide direct services to the public can benefit from setting customer service standards, clearly communicating these standards to customers, and ensuring these standards are being met.  The Administration will identify best practices in setting customer service standards, such as placing an emphasis on first contact resolution, and facilitate implementation of these practices for high impact services.</li>
<li><em>Utilize technology to improve the customer experience.</em>  The Administration will work to deliver world-class customer services to citizens by making it faster and easier for individuals and businesses to complete transactions with government online.  Given the continually growing importance of online services, the Administration has established a separate Cross-Agency Priority Goal to focus resources and attention on this priority area. </li>

The Administration will work with agencies to utilize existing authorities to attract top talent and consult with Agencies, the Office of Personnel Management, and Congressional stakeholders to expand the use of flexible hiring authorities. The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will also work with Agencies to incubate and scale new approaches to the design, development and delivery of top digital services and transactions.</li>
<li>Get the best companies working with government. The Administration’s efforts in this area will focus on streamlining the Federal IT acquisition process. Specific initiatives include creating more visibility of contracting opportunities for small, innovative companies; maximizing the use of available contracting flexibilities and best practices; and recommending administrative changes to the IT procurement processes.</li>
<li>Put the right processes and practices in place to drive outcomes and accountability. OMB will create and apply a new oversight and management process to highest impact IT investments in the Federal government. This process will include the best IT development and management approaches employed by the public and private sectors.  Lessons learned from this oversight process will be used to expand best practices across all agency IT investments.</li>

Today, proposals for contracts are lengthy, overly prescriptive, and laden with Government-specific requirements. There is also staggering duplication of contracts across Government and very little information sharing between agencies on pricing or other important contractual information. In order to fundamentally improve how taxpayer dollars are used in the Federal contracting space, the Administration is embarking on a comprehensive initiative to enhance collaboration and cooperation and drive greater innovation and improved performance through the implementation of Category Management.</p>
<p>This cross-agency priority (CAP) goal is focused on category management and will build on the progress made in the strategic sourcing initiative, leveraging the consolidated purchasing power of the Government to buy smarter and reduce duplication.  Category management is a new, more strategic approach that will enable the federal government to buy smarter and more like a single enterprise.  It involves identifying core areas of spend, developing heightened levels of expertise, leveraging shared best practices, providing streamlined solutions for acquisition, and managing supply and demand.  The objective is to increase efficiency and effectiveness while reducing costs and redundancies.  The first area of focus for category management is information technology and the CAP goal will support this initiative.  The objectives of the Category Management CAP goal will be expanded as the Category Management Leadership Council endorses other areas of focus.  The CAP Goal metrics can be found on the “supporting materials tabs” and progress updates will begin in the final Quarter of FY15.  </p>

If we are focused, committed, systematic, and intentional, we can make the sort of transformative changes in our service delivery approach that have altered the course of the commercial retail marketplace and reinvigorated American manufacturing. </p>
<p>We need to commit to driving efficiencies by creating opportunities to leverage existing resources and pool the government’s buying power.  This involves building common standards for underlying support activities and systems and driving out redundancy in administrative service provision.  It means changing agency expectations and incentives for spending.  And it means rethinking the way that the government considers and funds long-term investments in the systems and infrastructure that support customer service delivery. </p>
<p>The Federal Government will leverage the Executive Councils to develop common standards and benchmarks to measure shared service utilization, performance, and cost. Mandate those standards and benchmarks for common administrative services. From these standards and benchmarks we will drive efficiencies and greater performance by: 1) increasing the capacity of the Federal Shared Service Providers (SSPs) at DOI, USDA, Treasury, HHS, DOT and DOD; and 2) requiring use of lower-cost, higher-performing Shared Services for all agencies and SSPs which cannot meet established targets. We will target the following areas for Shared Services (listed in order of priority): financial, HR, technology, and acquisition.</p>

<p>The Administration will sustain and intensify these efforts in the second term by:</p>
<ul><li>Establishing cost and quality benchmarks for core/administrative operations, such as HR, Finance, Acquisition, and IT.  We will leverage the agency executive councils to develop common standards and benchmarks to measure shared service utilization, performance, and cost.  We will then use those standards and benchmarks for common administrative services as the baseline for driving continuous improvements in performance.</li>
<li>Cutting improper payments.

<p>The Administration has made significant progress in improving the management of information resources to increase interoperability and openness. In executive order 13642 President Obama outlined a clear vision for “Making Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information” wherever possible and legally permissible. The subsequently released Open Data Policy (OMB memorandum M-13-13) directed agencies to effectively “manage the information as a strategic asset” throughout its lifecycle and make data open by default to the extent permitted by law, while ensuring strict controls to safeguard individual privacy, confidentiality, and national security. </p>
<p>As a direct result, Americans are getting better access to government information and services they need. Homeowners who are struggling to pay their mortgages now get prompt, clear responses because companies are competing based on open consumer financial product complaint data published by CFPB, and can stay in their homes. Similarly, patients can now comparison shop to see which hospitals have the best outcomes and best prices thanks to data published by Medicaid and HHS—including a new dataset that for the first time shows what hospitals charge for inpatient services associated with the 100 most common kinds of hospital stays, revealing huge variations in hospital charges across the country and even within metro areas.</p>
<p>To drive further impact and results, the Open Data CAP Goal will focus on a series of government-wide objectives, strategies and major metrics that facilitate and gauge the outcome-oriented and management improvement goals of Open Data.  Metrics will prioritize three channels of impact measurement: impact on economic value creation organizations, impact on existing public program outcomes, and impact on internal government efficiency.  </p>

In the short term, we will identify and address the erosion of the original flexibilities of Title 5.  In the long term, we will work closely with labor unions and use demonstration projects and/or legislation and regulatory changes to ensure that our hiring processes attract and retain America’s talent.  We will measure the success of this effort by assessing manager satisfaction with the quality of both applicants and their hires after six months on the job. </li>

                    <p>Agencies establish a variety of organizational goals to drive progress toward key outcomes for the American people. Long-term strategic goals articulate clear statements of what the agency wants to achieve to advance its mission and address relevant national problems, needs, challenges and opportunities. Strategic objectives define the outcome or management impact the agency is trying to achieve, and also include the agency's role. Each strategic objective is tracked through a suite of performance goals, indicators and other evidence.

                            <div class='thingtoshoworhide' style='display: none'><p>In developing our Agency Strategic Plan, which includes our Priority Goals, we consulted with employees, stakeholders, advisory groups, and Congress. We also conducted an environmental scan to identify current and emerging trends that will directly or indirectly affect our mission, workloads, and business processes. Socioeconomic and demographic changes, along with advancements in technology, have implications for the future of our programs, workforce, and service delivery. We believe our plan provides a framework for our efforts and for thoughtful public discussion of our role and priorities.</p>

<p>The foundation for increasing our online services is the <strong><em><a href="http://ssa.gov/myaccount/">my Social Security</a></em></strong> portal we established in 2012 and enhanced in early 2013.  Through this portal, people who register can view their Social Security Statement, get a benefit verification letter, start or change their direct deposit, and change their address – all online.</p>
<p>We are enhancing <strong><em><a href="http://ssa.gov/myaccount/">my Social Security</a></em></strong> to allow customers to file a claim for retirement or disability benefits, request a replacement Social Security card, and access many other services.  We will also expand the portal to include online notice delivery and offer the choice to opt out of paper notices.  The enhanced capability will allow us to communicate with customers on the status of their claims or appeals and advise them of any documents we may need from them.</p>
<p>To accommodate increases in mobile technology use, we will accelerate our development of applications using responsive design (i.e., applications will automatically adjust to work on any electronic device).  We will be able to deliver service seamlessly and conveniently to smartphones, tablets and laptops alike.</p>
<p>As of September 2013, 6.2 million people had created accounts under <strong><em><a href="http://ssa.gov/myaccount/">my Social Security</a></em></strong>.  Our goal is to significantly increase the number of registrants each year.  We are developing an aggressive, multi-faceted marketing and promotional strategy to attract customers to our online service offerings.  This effort will support yet another of our major initiatives – to significantly increase use of our online services.</p>
<p><u>Strategies:</u></p>
<ul><li>Expand personal services available under <a href="http://ssa.gov/myaccount/"><strong><em>my Social Security</em></strong></a> to include high-volume workloads, such as Social Security number replacement cards;</li>
<li>Move our online applications under a single customer account registration;</li>
<li>Accelerate development of additional online products;</li>
<li>Expand the availability of online applications using responsive design and the use of self-help personal computers available in our offices or community locations;</li>
<li>Provide direct access to information and notices for individuals and designated third parties;</li>
<li>Offer electronic delivery of notices and an option to opt out of paper notices; and</li>
<li>Increase the public’s use of self-service options by aggressively promoting and marketing our online applications and services.</li>

<p>As part of a broader initiative to support one-stop online access to multiple government services, we will collaborate with other government agencies and community organizations to install Social Security Express kiosks (i.e., self-service computer stations offering access to our online services) at their respective facilities.  This collaboration will benefit both the customer and our agency as we anticipate cost savings from expanding our online self-service options.</p>
<p>We will work to increase our collaboration with the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs on the Wounded Warriors Initiative.  In this effort, we focus on improving the transfer of medical information, expediting the disability claims process, and facilitating payments to wounded service members, veterans, and their families.  Electronic sharing of medical information is a key feature of this initiative.</p>
<p><u>Strategies:</u></p>
<ul><li>Pending result of the pilot, implement Social Security Express to provide service using self-service kiosks in community locations;</li>
<li>Provide Social Security services through other government agencies, community-based organizations, tribal governments, and private organizations that serve our customers;</li>

The Internet provides the public with the ability to conduct Social Security business at their convenience and at their own pace, without the need to travel to a field office or wait to meet with one of our representatives. In addition to being convenient, increased use of online services benefits the public and SSA by reducing the average time our employees spend processing claims, freeing them to handle workloads that are more complicated.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, we implemented several new, secure and easy-to-use online services, which allow us to handle the surge of benefit applications better. Our goal is to continue increasing the variety of online services we offer, including the ability to apply for a range of benefits, access information instantly, and update records. We are committed to making our online services secure and easy to use. In FY 2013, customers submitted more than 2.5 million retirement and disability applications online, an 80 percent increase over FY 2009, when customers submitted 1.4 million claims online.</p>
<p>Developing online services for a population with a variety of experiences and comfort levels with technology presents a unique challenge. We solicit stakeholder input using a variety of methods prior to developing our services. Usability testing, focus groups, and advocacy discussions are common tools we use to engage our external stakeholders. We also consult with our employees when developing online services. Once we implement new online services, we continue to engage the public by soliciting their feedback using the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI). Federal and private sectors use ACSI surveys to measure public satisfaction with various website features.

<p>We work hard to ensure that all beneficiaries receive the correct amount.  Our payment accuracy rate for retirement and survivors benefits is greater than 99 percent.  However, our DI and SSI programs are more error prone due to the complexity of the laws for both programs and the variability of SSI payments from month to month based on a recipient’s changes in income, resources, and living arrangements.  We rely on recipients to self-report this information, and their failure to report timely is a significant reason for the difficulty in our SSI payment accuracy rate.</p>
<p>We have identified several strategies to increase payment accuracy in our DI and SSI programs and will work diligently to realize improvements in these areas:</p>
<ul><li>We will collaborate with other Federal and State agencies that serve similar populations, so we can benefit from shared ideas and best practices in ensuring proper payment.  Among the potential solutions is better use of data exchanges to produce a more efficient and accurate process for receiving payment-affecting information.  For example, we exchange data with the Department of Defense to verify entitlement to Special Veterans’ Benefits.  In addition, the IRS shares Form 1099 information to help us verify SSI eligibility and payment amounts.</li>
<li>We also will increase our partnerships with financial institutions to build on the success of our Access to Financial Institutions (AFI) initiative to identify financial resources that can affect SSI eligibility and often go unreported.  AFI allows us to check SSI recipient bank records to ensure that recipients remain eligible for benefits.  Over the next decade, this initiative will save American taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.</li>
<li>Even after we approve a person for benefits, we periodically review many of their cases to ensure that they continue to meet the eligibility requirements under each program.  For example, we complete SSI redeterminations, which are periodic reviews of non-medical factors of SSI eligibility, such as income and resources.  On average SSI non-medical redeterminations produce about $5 of net program savings per dollar spent, with savings from overpayments partly offset from the cost for underpayments.</li>
<li>For many years, we have used predictive models (i.e., computer-based screening tools) and data analytics tools to improve the integrity of our programs.  With data from other agencies and other sources in the private sector, we will explore additional uses of predictive models, data analytics, and automation tools to provide cost-effective means to increase payment accuracy.</li>
<li>Our representative payee program historically has been vulnerable to fraud.  Based on recommendations from oversight organizations, we have strengthened our policy, selection criteria, and review process.  We are developing a long-term strategic approach to improving the program.  Current efforts include using a predictive model that identifies cases with a higher probability of potential misuse and piloting a process for conducting criminal background checks on payee applicants during our selection process.  We are also working with other agencies with similar programs to determine the potential for collaboration on payee activities.</li>
</ul><p><u>Strategies</u>:</p>
<ul><li>Collaborate with other Federal agencies, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services within the Department of Health and Human Services, to find innovative ways to prevent and reduce improper payments;</li>
<li>Increase efforts to recover overpayments;</li>
<li>Enhance predictive models and automation tools to help identify error-prone aspects of benefit eligibility;</li>
<li>Expand use of data analytics to reduce fraud and payment errors; and</li>
<li>Streamline the Representative Payee Program to better identify potential misuse of benefits.</li>

                                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>SSI is a means-tested program designed to provide a monthly payment to aged, blind, or disabled people with limited income and resources. Adults, as well as children, can receive payments based on disability or blindness.</p>
<p>SSI payments are calculated using a statutory definition where payment levels for beneficiaries can change from month-to–month, which may result in an improper payment. Two factors used to determine an individual's monthly benefit are income and living arrangements. Income can be in cash or in-kind, and is usually anything that a person receives that can be used to obtain food or shelter. Cash income includes wages, Social Security and other pensions, and unemployment compensation. In-kind income is food and shelter or something someone can use to obtain those items.</p>
<p>Individuals' SSI benefit amounts also may change if they move in to a different “living arrangement”—whether a person lives alone or with others, or resides in a medical facility or other institution. For instance, when an individual moves into a nursing home, the person’s monthly payment may be reduced to as little as $30 per month. If the person moves from his or her own household into the household of another person, and that person provides food or shelter, the payment also may be reduced.</p>
<p>An individual’s resources also affect eligibility for the SSI program. An individual is not eligible for benefits if his or her countable resources exceed $2,000, and couples are not eligible if their countable resources exceed $3,000. In general, SSA counts as resources items individuals can convert to cash and use for their support and maintenance, such as bank accounts, stocks, and bonds.</p>
<p>The design of the SSI program requires that SSA adjust benefit payments to account for these factors. SSA explains to SSI recipients that they must report these changes to us when they occur. Absent their timely reporting, it is difficult to obtain information about these changes in a prompt fashion, resulting in some erroneous payments. Additionally, even if individuals report in a timely manner, SSA is required to first provide written notification of how the change affects their benefit amounts and provide due process protections. This process delays adjusting payments to the correct amount. Furthermore, SSA generally makes SSI payments on the first day of the month for eligibility in that month. Even if the payment is correct when paid, any changes that may occur during the month can affect the payment due, which can result in an overpayment or underpayment. Thus, the program requirements themselves sometimes cause erroneous payments.</p>
<p>SSA’s SSI improper payment accuracy reflects the complex nature of the SSI program. SSA is working on improving administration of the SSI program, focusing on how technology can make the agency more efficient. SSA is currently offering telephone wage reporting and a smart-phone application for reporting wages and is expanding our use of those technologies.  SSA is also working on expanded use of Lexis-Nexis to verify real property, and numerous other projects designed to improve our service and ensure the integrity of our payments.</p>

Thus, the program requirements themselves sometimes cause erroneous payments.</p>
<p>SSA’s SSI improper payment accuracy reflects the complex nature of the SSI program. SSA is working on improving administration of the SSI program, focusing on how technology can make the agency more efficient. SSA is currently offering telephone wage reporting and a smart-phone application for reporting wages and is expanding our use of those technologies.  SSA is also working on expanded use of Lexis-Nexis to verify real property, and numerous other projects designed to improve our service and ensure the integrity of our payments.</p>

<p>We are using a new analytical tool that provides many of our ALJs and support staff with MI on their work relative to the rest of their office, their region, and the Nation.  The information we gain from this analysis will help us to improve the way we review and decide disability cases, making our process simpler and more efficient.</p>
<p>We will continue our partnerships with other agencies to further modernize key aspects of our disability process.  These include our partnership with the National Academy of Science’s Institute of Medicine to revise our disability guidelines to reflect the most up-to-date medical knowledge; our collaboration with the Department of Labor to update our occupational information; and our partnership with the research community, for example the Disability Research Consortium, to refine our policy development.</p>
<p>We will also expand the use of technology to improve quality and consistency.  A few years ago, we implemented the electronic Claims Analysis Tool (eCAT) which assists disability examiners in documenting initial decisions to ensure compliance with agency policy.  We plan to expand eCAT to process CDRs.  Based on the success of eCAT, we used a similar approach to build a tool we can use at the appeals level.  We will eventually extend eCAT to our field offices, resulting in our agency having one tool to assist in ensuring proper documentation and compliance with agency policy throughout the entire disability process.</p>
<p>Expanding the use of video hearings – one of our key initiatives – will help increase efficiency and improve customer service.  Specifically, it will enable us to balance workloads across the country, reduce the need for (and the costs of) our ALJs and other hearing office staff to travel between offices and to remote sites to hold hearings, and reduce the need for claimants to travel long distances to hearing offices.  We also are working to expand video hearing participation more broadly to allow more attorneys and non-attorney representatives to install and use their own video equipment to attend hearings from their own offices.</p>
<p><u>Strategies: </u></p>
<ul><li>Expand use of MI to identify training needs and areas for improvement;</li>
<li>Broaden use of case analysis tools;</li>
<li>Expand use of predictive modeling;</li>
<li>Simplify policies;</li>
<li>Collaborate with the Bureau of Labor Statistics to collect updated occupational information; and</li>

                                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>Social Security pays disability benefits to people who cannot work because they have a medical condition expected to last at least one year or result in death.  When we receive a claim for disability benefits, we consider all the information concerning a case before we make an eligibility decision.  When we make a decision, we send a letter explaining our decision. If you do not agree with our decision, you can appeal, asking us to look at your case again.  The reconsideration is the first level of our appeals process and involves a complete review of the claim by someone who did not take part in the original decision.  If you disagree with the reconsideration decision, you may ask for a hearing. An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) who had no part in the original decision or the reconsideration of the case conducts a hearing.  Though the vast majority of hearings held are disability related, ALJs also hold hearings for non-disability related issues such as retirement.</p>
<p>We hold hearings either in-person at one of our 169 hearings offices or by using video teleconferencing equipment at many more locations.  Those locations include:</p>
<ul><li>Other hearing offices;</li>
<li>Permanent remote sites, which are leased spaces, usually in government buildings, in parts of the country some distance from hearing offices with large geographical service areas;</li>
<li>Claimant-only video sites, which are typically located in Social Security field offices some distance from hearing offices with large geographical service areas;and</li>
<li>Our National Hearing Centers (NHC), which are special hearing offices located around the country where we hold only video hearings.</li>
</ul><p>As part of our Representative Video Project, claimants may also attend a hearing at their representative’s office if that representative owns and uses video equipment approved by Social Security.</p>
<p>A video hearing allows hearing participants to see and hear each other through large color television screens or desktop video units.  The ALJ remains in the hearing office.  The ALJ can see and speak with all hearing participants and vice versa through Social Security’s secure network.  As with in-person hearings, we only record audio at video hearings.</p>
<p>The greatest benefit of video is that it allows us to assist offices that have more work than they can complete.  Being able to move work from an office that has a significant backlog to one that does not helps us provide effective service to all claimants.  The economic downturn did not affect all of our hearing offices equally.  Due to regional differences in the economy, some hearing offices saw their workloads soar while others did not.  Rather than only build new offices in our hardest-hit areas, and hiring and moving staff at great expense, Social Security’s response was to leverage our developing video hearing technology.  Because of video, we can electronically move the work to an ALJ ready to hear and decide the case.</p>
<p>Though we had been using video on a very limited basis since FY 2005, our breakthrough came with the introduction of the NHCs, which hold only video hearings and can therefore provide relief to any hearing office throughout the country.  Beginning in FY 2008, we began opening this new kind of office.</p>
<p>We also accelerated the placement of video units in hearing offices.  Between FY 2008 and FY 2013, we placed 1,032 video units in the hearing operation, with more than 960 of those going to traditional hearing offices.  This aggressive expansion allowed hearing offices to provide assistance to one another and to hold hearings in far-flung permanent remote sites within a hearing office’s own service area.  In this way, offices in California and Florida can assist offices in the Midwest and vice-versa, depending on the changing needs of our offices.  In FY 2013, traditional hearing offices held approximately 23 percent of all hearings by video.</p>
<p>We have incrementally increased the percentage of hearings we hold by video from 20 percent in FY 2010 and FY 2011, to 23 percent in FY 2012 and now to 26 percent (179,308 hearings) in FY 2013.  Much of this growth came from increasing our video footprint, achieved by equipping more and more of our hearing offices and remote hearing sites with video equipment each successive year.  We are aiming to hold 28 percent of hearings by video in FY 2014 and 30 percent in FY 2015.</p>
<p>Though we are nearing the saturation point for video equipment placement, we believe further video hearing expansion is possible, and that we can still greatly improve customer service. We can hold more video hearings by improving the quality, marketing, and deployment of video units and by publishing a final regulation that puts time limits on a claimant’s right to decline a video hearing.</p>
<p>Further expansion of video hearings positions Social Security for maximum flexibility in responding to changing customer needs.  Video lets us electronically move work rather than build “brick and mortar” offices whose useful lifespan may be limited.</p>

<p>When fully implemented, our State DDS and Federal disability case processing sites will use a common system (i.e., DCPS).  DCPS will replace all the disparate applications currently in use at the State DDSs and Federal sites, many of which are rigid, outdated, and resource intensive.  The new system will incorporate additional functionality, such as decision support tools, improved quality checks, improved MI, and compatibility with industry standards for electronic medical records.</p>
<p>Expanded use of health IT offers yet another opportunity to realize efficiencies in the disability process.  Among other positive effects, health IT will enable us to quickly recognize if a treating healthcare provider is also one of our health IT partners.  If a provider is a health IT partner, our systems communicate directly with the provider’s systems to request medical records, confirm the claimant or beneficiary has provided an authorization for release of information form, and return the provider’s records to us.  Health IT has the potential to increase our efficiency and lower the claimant’s wait time for a decision by giving us medical evidence within minutes rather than days or weeks.</p>

An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) who had no part in the original decision or the reconsideration of the case conducts a hearing.  Though the vast majority of hearings held are disability related, ALJs also hold hearings for non-disability related issues such as retirement.</p>
<p>We hold hearings either in-person at one of our 169 hearings offices or by using video teleconferencing equipment at many more locations.  Those locations include:</p>
<ul><li>Other hearing offices;</li>
<li>Permanent remote sites, which are leased spaces, usually in government buildings, in parts of the country some distance from hearing offices with large geographical service areas;</li>
<li>Claimant-only video sites, which are typically located in Social Security field offices some distance from hearing offices with large geographical service areas;and</li>
<li>Our National Hearing Centers (NHC), which are special hearing offices located around the country where we hold only video hearings.</li>
</ul><p>As part of our Representative Video Project, claimants may also attend a hearing at their representative’s office if that representative owns and uses video equipment approved by Social Security.</p>
<p>A video hearing allows hearing participants to see and hear each other through large color television screens or desktop video units.  The ALJ remains in the hearing office.  The ALJ can see and speak with all hearing participants and vice versa through Social Security’s secure network.  As with in-person hearings, we only record audio at video hearings.</p>
<p>The greatest benefit of video is that it allows us to assist offices that have more work than they can complete.  Being able to move work from an office that has a significant backlog to one that does not helps us provide effective service to all claimants.  The economic downturn did not affect all of our hearing offices equally.  Due to regional differences in the economy, some hearing offices saw their workloads soar while others did not.  Rather than only build new offices in our hardest-hit areas, and hiring and moving staff at great expense, Social Security’s response was to leverage our developing video hearing technology.  Because of video, we can electronically move the work to an ALJ ready to hear and decide the case.</p>
<p>Though we had been using video on a very limited basis since FY 2005, our breakthrough came with the introduction of the NHCs, which hold only video hearings and can therefore provide relief to any hearing office throughout the country.  Beginning in FY 2008, we began opening this new kind of office.</p>
<p>We also accelerated the placement of video units in hearing offices.  Between FY 2008 and FY 2013, we placed 1,032 video units in the hearing operation, with more than 960 of those going to traditional hearing offices.  This aggressive expansion allowed hearing offices to provide assistance to one another and to hold hearings in far-flung permanent remote sites within a hearing office’s own service area.  In this way, offices in California and Florida can assist offices in the Midwest and vice-versa, depending on the changing needs of our offices.  In FY 2013, traditional hearing offices held approximately 23 percent of all hearings by video.</p>
<p>We have incrementally increased the percentage of hearings we hold by video from 20 percent in FY 2010 and FY 2011, to 23 percent in FY 2012 and now to 26 percent (179,308 hearings) in FY 2013.  Much of this growth came from increasing our video footprint, achieved by equipping more and more of our hearing offices and remote hearing sites with video equipment each successive year.  We are aiming to hold 28 percent of hearings by video in FY 2014 and 30 percent in FY 2015.</p>
<p>Though we are nearing the saturation point for video equipment placement, we believe further video hearing expansion is possible, and that we can still greatly improve customer service. We can hold more video hearings by improving the quality, marketing, and deployment of video units and by publishing a final regulation that puts time limits on a claimant’s right to decline a video hearing.</p>
<p>Further expansion of video hearings positions Social Security for maximum flexibility in responding to changing customer needs.  Video lets us electronically move work rather than build “brick and mortar” offices whose useful lifespan may be limited.</p>

<p>Training and employee development will be critical to improving the competency and agility of our workforce and are key initiatives for the agency.  We cannot afford during difficult budget times to sacrifice training and development – if we cut back in these areas, our service delivery will decline in the future.  Increasing online services will also draw less complex work away from the field offices, so we must commit to offering highly trained staff to address the more difficult questions that will come into our field offices.</p>

<p>To meet our service delivery challenges, we rely upon a large and complex technology infrastructure that includes two data centers, extensive national databases, hundreds of software applications, large supporting computing platforms, and thousands of networked computers, printers, telephones, and other devices (e.g., smart phones).  Change to our IT infrastructure is constant.  We strive to ensure responsive, reliable performance to our customers and employees in the presence of this constant change.</p>
<p>Our two data centers, the National Computer Center (NCC) and the Second Support Center, maintain the demographic, wage, and benefit information that enables prompt and accurate benefit payments.  The NCC has been in continuous operation as a data center since it opened in 1980.  Congress approved our requested funding to build a new data center, the National Support Center (NSC), and extensive planning is underway for the move to this new facility.  We will transition all operations from the existing NCC to the new NSC in FY 2015 and FY 2016.  The NSC will provide increased capacity and improved operational reliability and efficiency.</p>

We will prioritize our work efforts to ensure that our customers can access essential Social Security services whenever they want; wherever they want.</p>
<p>We will improve options for online customers by providing additional online services and improving existing services. These services allow our agency to provide essential information and services around the clock to those members of the public who prefer to conduct business online, allowing our frontline employees to spend more time with customers who need more personal assistance. This will provide an overall higher quality of service to our customers and moves us closer to our goal of a superior customer experience.</p>
<p>We are committed to providing secure and easy to use online services. In FY 2014, customers conducted almost 71 million transactions online, a 42.5 percent increase over FY 2010, when customers conducted almost 13.5 million transactions online. Developing online services for a population with a variety of experiences and comfort levels with technology presents a unique challenge. We solicit input using a variety of methods prior to developing our services. Usability testing, focus groups, and advocacy discussions are common tools we use to engage our external stakeholders. We also consult with our employees when developing online services. Once we implement new online services, we continue to engage the public by soliciting their feedback using online customer satisfaction surveys that are applied across the Federal and private sectors to measure public satisfaction with various website features. In addition to online feedback, we also use internal survey mechanisms  to improve our online services. These tools provide us with standard, statistical measurements of public satisafction, and we use this information to guide decision-making for future improvements.</p>
<p>Important influencing factors for this goal are information security and ease of use.  Executive Order (EO) 13681, Improving the Security of Consumer Financial Transactions, has established requirements that will increase security but may have an adverse impact on ease of use.  As of July 2, 2015, OMB had not published guidance for the EO, but implementation of a second factor, regardless of the guidance, will require additional steps in both the registration process and for each login.  The additional complexity might reduce usage</p>

</p>
                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p> 	The Social Security Administration manages the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program.  SSI is a needs-based program that provides a monthly benefit to people who have low income and few resources, and who are age 65 or older, blind, or disabled.  Adults and children (i.e. an individual under the age of 18 or an individual under age 22 who regularly attends a qualifying school and is not married nor head of a home) can receive benefits based on disability or blindness.  </p>
<p> 	The SSI program is complex, in part, because we determine an individual's eligibility on a monthly basis.  An individual must meet all factors of eligibility each month to receive SSI benefits.  Factors of eligibility include, but are not limited to, having low income and few resources.  </p>
<p> 	A person is not eligible for benefits if his or her countable resources are worth more than $2,000.  Married persons who live in the same household are not eligible if their countable resources are worth more than $3,000.  In general, we count as resources items that individuals can change to cash and use for their support and maintenance, such as property, stocks, U.S. savings bonds, and money in bank accounts.  Generally, we do <u>not</u> count as resources such items as the home in which a person lives, one vehicle for transportation, burial plots for an individual or the immediate family, household goods, and personal property.  </p>
<p> 	If a person is eligible for SSI, we calculate the payment based on a legal definition of income and living situation (arrangement).  Income can be in-kind or cash.  In-kind income is <u>not</u> cash, but is food, shelter, or an item that a person can use to get one of these items (e.g. a third party pays for the person's food or shelter).  Some types of cash income include wages, net earnings from self-employment, Social Security benefits, pensions, and unemployment compensation.  </p>
<p> 	In addition, an individual's eligibility for SSI and payment amount may change if he or she moves into a different living arrangement - whether a person lives alone, lives with others, or lives in a medical facility or other institution.  When a change occurs, we decide whether the individual is eligible for SSI.  If eligible for SSI, we calculate the payment.  For example, when a person moves into a nursing home and is eligible for SSI, we may reduce the person's payment to $30 per month.  Also, when an individual moves from his or her own home into the home of another person and the person gives food or shelter to the individual, we decide whether the change affects the individual's eligibility for SSI.  If eligible for SSI, we may lower the individual's payment because the individual is receiving in-kind income.  </p>
<p> 	In general, we calculate an eligible person's payment based upon income received two months (e.g. January) before the month of payment (e.g. March).  Since an individual's circumstances may change from month to month, paying the correct amount at the right time is problematic.  Therefore, we are working to increase our ability to pay benefits correctly by making the program simpler and using more data and technology.  While our main goal is to prevent paying individuals more SSI payments than they are due (overpayments), we are also committed to avoid paying people less money than they are due (underpayments).  </p>
<p> 	We must decide eligibility monthly and calculate payment monthly based upon several factors, such as income and living arrangements.  Mostly, we depend on an individual to report changes that may affect eligibility or payment.  Without a person's timely reporting, we have difficulty getting information about changes and correcting benefits quickly if necessary, which causes us to release some improper payments.  Additionally, if an individual reports changes timely (i.e. no later than 10 days after the end of the month in which the change occurred), the agency must give written notice of how the change affects his or her benefit before we make any changes.  The written notice must give the person the right to appeal our decision.  The notice and appeal process delay our ability to correct payments timely.  </p>
<p> 	Generally, we pay SSI on the first day of the month.  We decide eligibility about the third week of a month (e.g. February) for the next month (March).  If a person is eligible for SSI, we calculate payment based upon income the person received two months (e.g. January) before the month of payment (e.g. March).  Since we use information that we have before the first day of the month to decide eligibility and payment for the month, any changes that may occur during the month can affect the benefit due, which can result in an overpayment or underpayment.  Therefore, the program's rules for deciding eligibility and payment may cause us to issue benefits incorrectly.  </p>

<p>Although we constantly explore process efficiencies to improve our capacity and performance, only ALJs can hear and decide cases.  We expect that with increased ALJ and support staff hiring in ODAR, we will begin reducing the pending requests for hearings before the end of calendar year 2016.  Our first priority area in reducing the pending is focusing on completing our oldest pending cases first and we must do so without sacrificing the quality of our hearing decisions.</p>
<p>Historically our Aged Case Initiatives have proved highly effective in reducing our pending and eliminating our oldest cases first.  Clearing our aged cases is vitally important to the Agency, to the Acting Commissioner, and most importantly, to the American people.  It is both a business imperative and a moral imperative to serve these members of the public who have waited the longest by providing timely, quality disability hearing decisions.</p>

</p>
                               <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>Online services are vital to good public service. The Internet provides the public with the ability to conduct Social Security business at their convenience and at their own pace, without the need to travel to a field office or wait to meet with one of our representatives. In addition to being convenient, increased use of online services benefits the public and SSA by reducing the average time our employees spend processing claims, freeing them to handle workloads that are more complicated.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, we implemented several new, secure and easy-to-use online services, which allow us to handle the surge of benefit applications better. Our goal is to continue increasing the variety of online services we offer, including the ability to apply for a range of benefits, access information instantly, and update records. We are committed to making our online services secure and easy to use. In FY 2013, customers submitted more than 2.5 million retirement and disability applications online, an 80 percent increase over FY 2009, when customers submitted 1.4 million claims online.</p>
<p>Developing online services for a population with a variety of experiences and comfort levels with technology presents a unique challenge. We solicit stakeholder input using a variety of methods prior to developing our services. Usability testing, focus groups, and advocacy discussions are common tools we use to engage our external stakeholders. We also consult with our employees when developing online services. Once we implement new online services, we continue to engage the public by soliciting their feedback using the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI). Federal and private sectors use ACSI surveys to measure public satisfaction with various website features. In addition to the ACSI feedback, we also use internal survey mechanisms to improve our online services. These tools provide us with standard, statistical measurements of public satisfaction, and we use this information to guide decision-making for future improvements.</p>

                               <p><span class="acc_content_label">Statement:</span><p>Reduce the improper payment rate made under the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. By September 30, 2015*, we will reduce the improper payment rate made under the SSI program to no more than 6.2% of all payments made under the SSI program (i.e. overpayments and underpayments).</p>
<p>*Because of the difficulties in evaluating payment accuracy, there is a 7-month lag in obtaining end–of-year data.  We will not have FY 2014 data available until April 2015.  FY 2015 data will be available in April 2016.</p>
</p>
                               <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>SSI is a means-tested program designed to provide a monthly payment to aged, blind, or disabled people with limited income and resources. Adults, as well as children, can receive payments based on disability or blindness.</p>
<p>SSI payments are calculated using a statutory definition where payment levels for beneficiaries can change from month-to–month, which may result in an improper payment. Two factors used to determine an individual's monthly benefit are income and living arrangements. Income can be in cash or in-kind, and is usually anything that a person receives that can be used to obtain food or shelter. Cash income includes wages, Social Security and other pensions, and unemployment compensation. In-kind income is food and shelter or something someone can use to obtain those items.</p>
<p>Individuals' SSI benefit amounts also may change if they move in to a different “living arrangement”—whether a person lives alone or with others, or resides in a medical facility or other institution. For instance, when an individual moves into a nursing home, the person’s monthly payment may be reduced to as little as $30 per month. If the person moves from his or her own household into the household of another person, and that person provides food or shelter, the payment also may be reduced.</p>
<p>An individual’s resources also affect eligibility for the SSI program. An individual is not eligible for benefits if his or her countable resources exceed $2,000, and couples are not eligible if their countable resources exceed $3,000. In general, SSA counts as resources items individuals can convert to cash and use for their support and maintenance, such as bank accounts, stocks, and bonds.</p>
<p>The design of the SSI program requires that SSA adjust benefit payments to account for these factors. SSA explains to SSI recipients that they must report these changes to us when they occur. Absent their timely reporting, it is difficult to obtain information about these changes in a prompt fashion, resulting in some erroneous payments. Additionally, even if individuals report in a timely manner, SSA is required to first provide written notification of how the change affects their benefit amounts and provide due process protections. This process delays adjusting payments to the correct amount. Furthermore, SSA generally makes SSI payments on the first day of the month for eligibility in that month. Even if the payment is correct when paid, any changes that may occur during the month can affect the payment due, which can result in an overpayment or underpayment. Thus, the program requirements themselves sometimes cause erroneous payments.</p>
<p>SSA’s SSI improper payment accuracy reflects the complex nature of the SSI program. SSA is working on improving administration of the SSI program, focusing on how technology can make the agency more efficient. SSA is currently offering telephone wage reporting and a smart-phone application for reporting wages and is expanding our use of those technologies.  SSA is also working on expanded use of Lexis-Nexis to verify real property, and numerous other projects designed to improve our service and ensure the integrity of our payments.</p>

</p>
                               <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>Social Security pays disability benefits to people who cannot work because they have a medical condition expected to last at least one year or result in death.  When we receive a claim for disability benefits, we consider all the information concerning a case before we make an eligibility decision.  When we make a decision, we send a letter explaining our decision. If you do not agree with our decision, you can appeal, asking us to look at your case again.  The reconsideration is the first level of our appeals process and involves a complete review of the claim by someone who did not take part in the original decision.  If you disagree with the reconsideration decision, you may ask for a hearing. An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) who had no part in the original decision or the reconsideration of the case conducts a hearing.  Though the vast majority of hearings held are disability related, ALJs also hold hearings for non-disability related issues such as retirement.</p>
<p>We hold hearings either in-person at one of our 169 hearings offices or by using video teleconferencing equipment at many more locations.  Those locations include:</p>
<ul><li>Other hearing offices;</li>
<li>Permanent remote sites, which are leased spaces, usually in government buildings, in parts of the country some distance from hearing offices with large geographical service areas;</li>
<li>Claimant-only video sites, which are typically located in Social Security field offices some distance from hearing offices with large geographical service areas;and</li>
<li>Our National Hearing Centers (NHC), which are special hearing offices located around the country where we hold only video hearings.</li>
</ul><p>As part of our Representative Video Project, claimants may also attend a hearing at their representative’s office if that representative owns and uses video equipment approved by Social Security.</p>
<p>A video hearing allows hearing participants to see and hear each other through large color television screens or desktop video units.  The ALJ remains in the hearing office.  The ALJ can see and speak with all hearing participants and vice versa through Social Security’s secure network.  As with in-person hearings, we only record audio at video hearings.</p>
<p>The greatest benefit of video is that it allows us to assist offices that have more work than they can complete.  Being able to move work from an office that has a significant backlog to one that does not helps us provide effective service to all claimants.  The economic downturn did not affect all of our hearing offices equally.  Due to regional differences in the economy, some hearing offices saw their workloads soar while others did not.  Rather than only build new offices in our hardest-hit areas, and hiring and moving staff at great expense, Social Security’s response was to leverage our developing video hearing technology.  Because of video, we can electronically move the work to an ALJ ready to hear and decide the case.</p>
<p>Though we had been using video on a very limited basis since FY 2005, our breakthrough came with the introduction of the NHCs, which hold only video hearings and can therefore provide relief to any hearing office throughout the country.  Beginning in FY 2008, we began opening this new kind of office.</p>
<p>We also accelerated the placement of video units in hearing offices.  Between FY 2008 and FY 2013, we placed 1,032 video units in the hearing operation, with more than 960 of those going to traditional hearing offices.  This aggressive expansion allowed hearing offices to provide assistance to one another and to hold hearings in far-flung permanent remote sites within a hearing office’s own service area.  In this way, offices in California and Florida can assist offices in the Midwest and vice-versa, depending on the changing needs of our offices.  In FY 2013, traditional hearing offices held approximately 23 percent of all hearings by video.</p>
<p>We have incrementally increased the percentage of hearings we hold by video from 20 percent in FY 2010 and FY 2011, to 23 percent in FY 2012 and now to 26 percent (179,308 hearings) in FY 2013.  Much of this growth came from increasing our video footprint, achieved by equipping more and more of our hearing offices and remote hearing sites with video equipment each successive year.  We are aiming to hold 28 percent of hearings by video in FY 2014 and 30 percent in FY 2015.</p>
<p>Though we are nearing the saturation point for video equipment placement, we believe further video hearing expansion is possible, and that we can still greatly improve customer service. We can hold more video hearings by improving the quality, marketing, and deployment of video units and by publishing a final regulation that puts time limits on a claimant’s right to decline a video hearing.</p>
<p>Further expansion of video hearings positions Social Security for maximum flexibility in responding to changing customer needs.  Video lets us electronically move work rather than build “brick and mortar” offices whose useful lifespan may be limited.</p>
