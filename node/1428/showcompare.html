            <div class="">
                <p>Exports are important to U.S. economic prosperity. The International Trade Administration (ITA) is committed to providing high-quality assistance that helps U.S. companies achieve their export objectives. This priority goal focuses on improving the quality of assistance ITA’s trade and commercial specialists provide to companies. ITA’s delivery of substantive, high value-added assistance is affirmed when companies receiving this assistance respond that they have achieved their export objectives. The Global Markets business unit within ITA is the organizational lead on this priority goal. It is imperative that Global Markets staff worldwide – all of whom interact with U.S. companies – are unified behind a common goal that focuses on unique needs of our customers. The FY12 – FY13 baseline average percentage of companies assisted that achieved their export objectives is 67 percent for ITA’s fee-for-service clients. To achieve this priority goal, Global Markets has sought to understand individual U.S. company needs to be successful internationally and, subsequently, offered a customized approach that draws on the full resources available across ITA and the Federal Government to meet those needs. This strategic shift towards offering a more consultative approach steers ITA professionals toward identifying the problems and challenges with exporting, and designing holistic solutions. It focuses ITA on engaging with clients to offer substantive, high value-added assistance, such as helping companies select the best markets to enter, overcoming export trade barriers, or finding suitable international business partners.</p>

                <p>Continued training for client-facing staff: To improve APG performance, Global Markets continued to train client-facing staff across the country and around the world on how to better understand, develop, and document a client’s export objectives, and then helped the client achieve those objectives; this includes training staff on best practices and standard operating procedures.</p>
<p>Expand data collection: Global Markets expanded the usage of Comment Cards to include non-fee-based services in order to collect more client feedback data. Additionally, ITA has implemented a new Customer Relationship Management system that will enable surveys to be sent to all clients that receive substantive assistance in FY16. This will include counseling and other assistance that is currently not tracked in an efficient and effective manner.</p>

            <h2>Progress Update</h2>
            <div>
                <p>In FY15 Q4, 74 percent of (GM) clients reported that they achieved their export objectives. This exceeds the 71 percent annual target and FY15 actual result stands at 73 percent. As a result, GM exceeded its annual target by 2 percentage points.</p>
<p>For FY15, progress toward ITA’s Agency Priority Goal (APG) was measured using GM’s “Comment Cards” system for fee-based services. A client’s response of a 9 or 10 (on a scale of 1-10) to the question “How well did we meet your export objectives?” is counted as a positive response. This use of 9 and 10 represents a “top two box score” and is consistent with survey industry standards. A fee-based service requires a Participation Agreement (PA) between the client and GM. In FY14 Q2, GM added an “objective” box to the PA. A mutually agreed to objective is documented in the mandatory open text field. Once GM closes a PA, this mutually agreed upon objective populates in the comment card which is sent to the client. The client indicates on the card if their objective was met and returns it to GM.</p>
<p>The addition of the objective box allowed GM to better understand, develop and document the client’s export objectives. This addition required extensive training throughout the lifecycle of the FY 14-15 APG. Initially, GM provided multiple online webinar trainings, as well as access to a recorded training session so client-facing staff understood how to properly formulate and set the clients’ export objectives. More importantly, GM had to provide ongoing training to client-facing staff on best practices and standard operating procedures on how to help achieve the clients’ objectives. As a result, GM was able to focus on and increase the percentage of objectives met to 73 percent in FY14-15 from an average of 67 percent in the FY11-13 period (please see the chart below for trend line data). An important lesson learned is the need for consistent guidance and ongoing training for employees. GM also saw that clients often wrote very positive comments while still only rating the service at a 7 or 8 rather than a 9 or 10. This observation was an interesting phenomena that GM hopes to study more in FY16-17. In addition, consistency in service delivery and standard operating procedures continues to be a significant driver of clients’ positive responses.</p>
<p>In FY15, GM also expanded the Comment Card system to include non-fee based services and events. This enabled GM to capture client feedback on a broader range of services to help improve and measure the full breadth of GM assistance to its clients. Beginning in FY 15 Q1, results for non-fee services were reported as a contextual indicator. In FY15 Q4, 79 percent of (GM) non-fee clients reported that they achieved their export objectives. The annual FY15 actual result stands at 77 percent. This data served as a contextual indicator only and is not counted towards the original APG statement and target.</p>
<p>One major shortcoming of this Comment Card system was that GM employees manually sent the non-fee based Comment Card to clients. As a result, GM was not able to properly determine the response rate for those who received non-fee based Comment Cards. GM was able to calculate the number of non-fee based Comment Cards received, but unable to calculate the number of non-fee based Comment Cards sent to clients. In addition, because employees were manually sending comment cards at their own discretion, there may have been survey bias in the results. For example, the employee may have sent only to clients with whom they had positive interactions, and the clients may not have responded as candidly because they received the comment card from the employee rather than a third party.</p>
<p>Moving forward for the FY16-17 APG, GM plans to continue using the same performance measure, but will expand it to include non-fee based services. ITA will begin to expand this measure to the other two ITA business units. This data will be reported as contextual indicators in order to begin collecting baseline data for non-fee based services. New guidance/training is being developed for the other two ITA units. As GM will be adapting to a new system for non-fee based comment cards, FY16-17 will continue to be learning years in this area. Based on lessons learned from the FY14-15 APG, ITA will need to properly train all staff on the new FY16-17 APG (as this was a GM only metric previously).</p>
<p>
Starting in FY16, GM will begin using a new Comment Card system for non-fee based services. This new Comment Card system has been integrated with the new Salesforce CRM system. Since comment cards will be sent automatically through the CRM system, GM will neutralize survey bias – both by removing the manual selection of customers and by sending them from a third party email address. In addition, GM will now be able to calculate the correct response rate for these types of services because the system will provide the number of comment cards sent as compared to the number of respondents.</p>
<p>Moreover, GM will start experimenting with a five-point scale instead of a ten-point scale for its Comment Cards. Survey research finds that scales between five to seven points are more reliable than scales with fewer points or more points. For that reason, GM wishes to experiment with using a five-point scale in order to receive more valid responses from clients. This will allow GM to address those clients who provide very positive comments, even noting objectives met, while rating GM at a seven or eight.</p>
<p>In addition, in FY16 Q1, GM will issue updated user-fee guidance and a new customer service policy to help clarify GM’s service delivery requirements and processes, price structure, and customer service best practices since these types of practices seem to positively influence customer responses.</p>

<p>Global Markets recorded 25,029 U.S. clients that received assistance in FY15. As a result, GM exceeded the annual target  of 23,000 by 9 percentage points.</p>
<p>In FY15Q4, Global Markets’ website, export.gov, received nearly 2.65 million page views, 1,311 new registered users, and 3,003 active account users. The FY15 annual actual result had over 12.33 million page views and 6,313 new registered users. This served as a contextual indicator only and is not counted towards the original APG statement and target. This contextual indicator allows GM to explore the breadth and reach of its online services, in an effort to fully capture how U.S. exporters benefit from GM’s services. GM is committed to improving its services to all U.S. exporters, both directly and indirectly, and observing website data will help GM determine how best to service U.S. exporters online and via the Internet.</p>

<p>The increase in the number of clients assisted from FY14 Q4 (3,816) to FY15 Q1 (6,344) resulted because existing clients are considered “new” at the beginning of the fiscal year. The number of new clients assisted decreases throughout the fiscal year as Global Markets continues to work with its existing clients. Additionally, the increase is due to GM management’s increased communication to employees on the importance of this metric.</p>

</p>
                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>The strength of the U.S. economy continues to depend on competitive manufacturing and services sectors and a vibrant open global marketplace. Growth in key foreign markets will help drive global economic recovery. More than one billion new consumers worldwide will enter the middle class during the next 15 years, and their buying power will increase the consumption of goods and services worldwide.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As economies around the world grow, some foreign governments develop policies that create barriers to U.S. companies in those markets. Such trade barriers and other unfair trade practices cost U.S. companies billions of dollars in lost revenue. Trade barriers result not only in financial loss, but also limit the ability of U.S. companies to expand production, hire additional workers, or pursue investment opportunities. Studies indicate that <em>trade openness</em> has added between $800 billion to $1.4 trillion to the U.S. economy since World War II, amounting to $7 thousand to $13 thousand per U.S. household.Removing the remaining trade barriers could result in an additional $400 billion to $1.3 trillion annually, or about an additional $4 thousand to $12 thousand per U.S. household.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Department will deploy its policy and promotional tools to help U.S. firms compete for new opportunities globally. A renewed focus on global competitiveness will help strengthen the long-term health of U.S. industries and stimulate domestic job creation. The Department will also use its strong expertise on export promotion and industry-economic-country issues to conduct holistic analyses of U.S. trade issues and needs, make recommendations, and take actions.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The Department, through its programs, expertise, and global presence, is uniquely positioned to help U.S. companies understand the importance of exporting.  Department research and analyses can identify the best export opportunities for U.S. goods and services.  With offices located in more than 70 countries, 48 U.S. states, Puerto Rico and Washington D.C., Department experts help U.S. companies access valuable market information, promote their products and services in target foreign markets, meet qualified international buyers and distributors, and overcome challenges and barriers when they do business overseas.  Moreover, the Secretary of Commerce, as chair of the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee, will lead the national export strategy, set priorities, and drive federal efforts to increase exports.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Foreign direct investment in the United States contributes significantly to U.S. economic growth and prosperity.  In 2011, value added by majority-owned U.S. affiliates of foreign companies accounted for 4.7 percent of total U.S. private output.  These firms employed 5.6 million people in the United States, or 4.1 percent of private-sector employment.  The United States competes with countries that have aggressive national programs to encourage businesses to move to or expand within their own borders.  In response to this competition, President Obama announced a federal <em>SelectUSA</em> initiative in 2011.  Led by the Department, <em>SelectUSA</em>, involves multiple Department bureaus, includes other federal agencies, and works alongside U.S. states and localities to advocate aggressively for the United States as a premier destination.  This coordinated federal effort assures the global investment community that <strong><em>America is open for business</em></strong>.  Furthermore, Department advocacy is backed up by capacity building grants to help communities create an economic ecosystem in which the private sector can leverage regional and community assets to promote foreign investment.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>As the federal agency charged with administering the U.S. antidumping and countervailing duty laws, the Department’s International Trade Administration (ITA) helps domestic manufacturers compete against unfairly traded imports into the United States.  ITA’s petition counseling unit helps U.S. workers and firms who assert damage from violations.  Focus is on assuring that small and medium-sized enterprises understand their rights and the requirements for filing a petition to initiate an investigation of possible foreign dumping and subsidization.  Once petitions seeking relief under the trade remedy laws are filed, ITA investigates the allegations. When imports are found to be dumped or subsidized and a cause of injury to U.S. industry, ITA instructs U.S. Customs and Border Protection to collect duties to offset the impact.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Department also offers assistance to U.S. exporters and investors, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, by coordinating government resources to overcome trade barriers.  This assistance educates U.S. industry on international trade agreements that maintain open markets . ITA’s trade experts monitor foreign government compliance with the more than 250 trade agreements so companies, investors, and workers realize the benefits of the agreements.  Through its full range of legal, analytical, investigatory, trade policy, and commercial expertise, the Department provides robust and comprehensive services to help U.S. exporters confront, forestall, and resolve foreign unfair trade practices.</p>

The International Trade Administration (ITA) is committed to providing high-quality assistance that helps U.S. companies achieve their export objectives. This priority goal focuses on improving the quality of assistance ITA’s trade and commercial specialists provide to companies. ITA’s delivery of substantive, high value-added assistance is affirmed when companies receiving this assistance respond that they have achieved their export objectives. The Global Markets business unit within ITA is the organizational lead on this priority goal. It is imperative that Global Markets staff worldwide – all of whom interact with U.S. companies – are unified behind a common goal that focuses on unique needs of our customers. The FY12 – FY13 baseline average percentage of companies assisted that achieved their export objectives is 67 percent for ITA’s fee-for-service clients. To achieve this priority goal, Global Markets has sought to understand individual U.S. company needs to be successful internationally and, subsequently, offered a customized approach that draws on the full resources available across ITA and the Federal Government to meet those needs. This strategic shift towards offering a more consultative approach steers ITA professionals toward identifying the problems and challenges with exporting, and designing holistic solutions. It focuses ITA on engaging with clients to offer substantive, high value-added assistance, such as helping companies select the best markets to enter, overcoming export trade barriers, or finding suitable international business partners.</p>

                        <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>The strength of the U.S. economy continues to depend on competitive manufacturing and services sectors and a vibrant open global marketplace. Growth in key foreign markets will help drive global economic recovery. More than one billion new consumers worldwide will enter the middle class during the next 15 years, and their buying power will increase the consumption of goods and services worldwide.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As economies around the world grow, some foreign governments develop policies that create barriers to U.S. companies in those markets. Such trade barriers and other unfair trade practices cost U.S. companies billions of dollars in lost revenue. Trade barriers result not only in financial loss, but also limit the ability of U.S. companies to expand production, hire additional workers, or pursue investment opportunities. Studies indicate that <em>trade openness</em> has added between $800 billion to $1.4 trillion to the U.S. economy since World War II, amounting to $7 thousand to $13 thousand per U.S. household.Removing the remaining trade barriers could result in an additional $400 billion to $1.3 trillion annually, or about an additional $4 thousand to $12 thousand per U.S. household.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Department will deploy its policy and promotional tools to help U.S. firms compete for new opportunities globally. A renewed focus on global competitiveness will help strengthen the long-term health of U.S. industries and stimulate domestic job creation. The Department will also use its strong expertise on export promotion and industry-economic-country issues to conduct holistic analyses of U.S. trade issues and needs, make recommendations, and take actions.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The Department, through its programs, expertise, and global presence, is uniquely positioned to help U.S. companies understand the importance of exporting.  Department research and analyses can identify the best export opportunities for U.S. goods and services.  With offices located in more than 70 countries, 48 U.S. states, Puerto Rico and Washington D.C., Department experts help U.S. companies access valuable market information, promote their products and services in target foreign markets, meet qualified international buyers and distributors, and overcome challenges and barriers when they do business overseas.  Moreover, the Secretary of Commerce, as chair of the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee, will lead the national export strategy, set priorities, and drive federal efforts to increase exports.</p>

                        <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>The United States has been the world’s largest recipient of foreign direct investment since 2006.  Every day, foreign companies establish new operations in the United States or provide additional capital to existing businesses.  With the world’s largest consumer market, skilled and productive workers, highly innovative culture, strong and effective legal system, predictable regulatory environment, and low cost energy resources, the United States has an attractive investment climate.  In addition, the nation’s strong commitment to environmental protection adds sustainability to U.S. assets.  To remain a premier investment destination, the United States must continue to nurture and build upon these strengths that make firms want to invest here.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Foreign direct investment in the United States contributes significantly to U.S. economic growth and prosperity.  In 2011, value added by majority-owned U.S. affiliates of foreign companies accounted for 4.7 percent of total U.S. private output.  These firms employed 5.6 million people in the United States, or 4.1 percent of private-sector employment.  The United States competes with countries that have aggressive national programs to encourage businesses to move to or expand within their own borders.  In response to this competition, President Obama announced a federal <em>SelectUSA</em> initiative in 2011.  Led by the Department, <em>SelectUSA</em>, involves multiple Department bureaus, includes other federal agencies, and works alongside U.S. states and localities to advocate aggressively for the United States as a premier destination.  This coordinated federal effort assures the global investment community that <strong><em>America is open for business</em></strong>.  Furthermore, Department advocacy is backed up by capacity building grants to help communities create an economic ecosystem in which the private sector can leverage regional and community assets to promote foreign investment.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>As the federal agency charged with administering the U.S. antidumping and countervailing duty laws, the Department’s International Trade Administration (ITA) helps domestic manufacturers compete against unfairly traded imports into the United States.  ITA’s petition counseling unit helps U.S. workers and firms who assert damage from violations.  Focus is on assuring that small and medium-sized enterprises understand their rights and the requirements for filing a petition to initiate an investigation of possible foreign dumping and subsidization.  Once petitions seeking relief under the trade remedy laws are filed, ITA investigates the allegations. When imports are found to be dumped or subsidized and a cause of injury to U.S. industry, ITA instructs U.S. Customs and Border Protection to collect duties to offset the impact.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Department also offers assistance to U.S. exporters and investors, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, by coordinating government resources to overcome trade barriers.  This assistance educates U.S. industry on international trade agreements that maintain open markets . ITA’s trade experts monitor foreign government compliance with the more than 250 trade agreements so companies, investors, and workers realize the benefits of the agreements.  Through its full range of legal, analytical, investigatory, trade policy, and commercial expertise, the Department provides robust and comprehensive services to help U.S. exporters confront, forestall, and resolve foreign unfair trade practices.</p>
