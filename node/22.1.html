                        <p>Since its establishment, NASA has helped to spur profound changes in our knowledge, culture, and expectations. Congress enacted the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 “to provide for research into problems of flight within and outside Earth’s atmosphere” and to ensure that the United States conducts activities in space devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of humanity. We have since been instrumental in numerous scientific discoveries and technological advances that have advanced humankind, while inspiring the Nation and the world to imagine that much more is possible.</p>
<p>We embrace the spirit, principles, and objectives of the original act and recent key policies and legislation in our Vision and Mission.</p>
<p><strong>NASA’s Vision: </strong>We reach for new heights and reveal the unknown for the benefit of humankind.</p>
<p><strong>NASA’s Mission:</strong> Drive advances in science, technology, aeronautics, and space exploration to enhance knowledge, education, innovation, economic vitality, and stewardship of Earth. </p>
<p>The following overarching approach governs the management and conduct of our aeronautics and space programs. These are standard practices that each organization within NASA employs in developing and executing their plans to achieve our strategic goals. They also provide a framework that guides our support for other areas of national and Administration policy: government transparency; science technology, engineering, and mathematics education; energy and climate change; innovation; and increased citizen and partnership participation to help address the multitude of challenges faced by our Nation.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Invest </strong>in next-generation technologies and approaches to spur innovation;</li>
<li><strong>Inspire </strong>students to be our future scientists, engineers, explorers, and educators through interactions with NASA’s people, missions, research, and facilities;</li>
<li><strong>Expand </strong>partnerships with international, intergovernmental, academic, industrial, and entrepreneurial communities, recognizing them as important contributors of skill and creativity to our missions and for the propagation of our results;</li>
<li><strong>Commit</strong> to environmental stewardship through Earth observation and science, and the development and use of green technologies and capabilities in NASA missions and facilities; and</li>
<li><strong>Safeguard</strong> the public trust<strong> </strong>through transparency and accountability in our programmatic and financial management, procurement, and reporting practices.</li>

<div class="intro_text">
<p>Established by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goals are a tool used to accelerate progress on a limited number of priority areas where implementation requires active collaboration between multiple agencies, overcoming organizational barriers to achieve better performance than one agency can achieve on its own.</p>
<p>Set or revised at least every four years, CAP Goals include outcome-oriented goals that cover a limited number of crosscutting policy areas as well as management goals focused on management improvements across the Federal Government in areas of financial management, strategic human capital management, information technology management, procurement and acquisition management, and real property management.</p>
<p>A series of 16 CAP Goals were announced in the 2015 Budget with clearly named accountable officials, data-driven reviews that incorporated a broad range of quantitative and qualitative inputs, and reporting to the public through a common website as a framework to drive performance improvements on cross-government collaboration and tackle government-wide management challenges affecting most agencies.</p>

<p>On June 30, 2016, the President signed into law the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 – nearly 50 years after President Johnson signed the original FOIA into law.  This critical legislation reflects the progress made by the Administration, codifies a number of openness and transparency principles, and ensures that the Administration’s track record of openness is institutionalized throughout government and carries forward for years to come.  Concurrent with the signing of the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, the White House released a Fact Sheet committing the Administration to:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Utilizing the Chief FOIA Officers Council and FOIA Advisory Committee to address FOIA’s greatest challenges;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promoting broader release of records through a “release to one is a release to all” presumption;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Launching a centralized FOIA request portal; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Issuing new guidance on open government principles and actions.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The Administration also announced the creation of a FOIA Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goal as a framework for tracking progress on the Administration’s commitments and key requirements of the Act.  Under the cross-agency leadership of the Department of Justice, National Archives and Records Administration, and Office of Management and Budget, the Administration remains committed to assisting agencies in their efforts to improve implementation of the FOIA and leveraging technology to achieve a new era of open government.  </p>

    Efficiency: Maximize value of Federal spending  </h3>

</div>  </div>  
  <div class="views-field views-field-field-cag-overview-revision-id">    <span class="views-label views-label-field-cag-overview-revision-id">Overview: </span>    <div class="field-content"><p>On March 19, 2015, the President issued Executive Order 13693, <em>Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade</em>, which set forth ambitious climate, energy, and environmental sustainability goals for Federal agencies over the next decade.  Executive departments and agencies have been among our Nation’s leaders as the United States works to build a clean energy economy that will sustain our prosperity and the health of our people and our environment for generations to come. Federal leadership in energy, environmental water, transportation fleets, buildings, and acquisition management will continue to drive national greenhouse gas reductions and support preparations for the impacts of climate change. The Federal Government has the opportunity to significantly reduce direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2025, while at the same time fostering innovation, reducing spending, and strengthening the communities in which our Federal facilities operate. </p>
<p>Employing this strategy for the next decade calls for expanded and updated Federal environmental performance goals with a clear overarching objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions across Federal operations and the Federal supply chain.  Goals for greenhouse gas emissions reduction (40% by 2025), renewable electricity (30% by 2025), clean energy (25% by 2025), and performance contracting ($4 billion in awarded contracts by Dec. 2016) are already well established in the Federal community. The enhanced target for each of these goals will require agencies to sharpen their focus on achieving the goals through existing mechanisms and new technologies that enhance efficiency and use of clean energy.</p>
<p>CEQ and OMB have worked closely to ensure that Federal agencies understand the necessary steps to pursuing the new environmental sustainability goals and those efforts are supported by an interagency Steering Committee.  Pursuit of these sustainability goals will involve at least 25 of the largest Federal agencies. Success will be greatly enhanced by the cross-cutting nature of the goals and the similarity in the tools and procedures used for implementation.</p>
<p>While all Federal agencies have an important role to play in ensuring the Government meets its energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets, key delivery agencies include: The General Services Administration, Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Energy, National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Department of Homeland Security.</p>

In the wake of increasing threats and incidents, the President directed a series of reviews to examine current security, suitability/fitness, and credentialing processes and to recommend areas in need of reform. The interagency reviews identified problem areas and made specific recommendations, which were approved by the Performance Accountability Council (PAC). The PAC developed the Strategic Intent to build upon these efforts and create a lasting impact by providing overarching strategic direction to personnel security, suitability/fitness, and credentialing reform efforts for the next five years.  </p>
<p>The Strategic Intent represents our framework for sustaining progress mandated by the February 2014 Suitability and Security Processes Review Report to the President, the January 2016 PAC Review of Background Investigations, relevant legislation, and other key drivers. It builds on progress since the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 and the subsequent, significant reform efforts that resulted in greater standardization and alignment of suitability and security processes. Through this framework, the PAC will work with other members of the Executive Branch to drive continuous process improvement to personnel security, suitability/fitness, and credentialing programs and address evolving threats. While we cannot eliminate risk altogether, it is imperative that we work across disciplines to maximize our collective efforts to mitigate the risks we face, while ensuring appropriate protections for privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. We must ensure measures to improve these programs avoid imposing unreasonable burdens on the Federal workforce that could negatively impact operations. Therefore, the Federal Government will pursue a balanced approach by addressing the risks posed by personnel who could do significant harm by virtue of the nature of their position.</p>
<p>These reforms will further support ongoing Insider Threat Program implementation by providing earlier detection and improving the quality of vetting. The improved attention to cybersecurity will reinforce efforts to protect sensitive mission data, including personally-identifiable information. </p>

According to AT Kearney’s Foreign Direct Investment Confidence Index, confidence in the U.S. as a location for FDI is high, ranking as the top destination for investment ahead of China, Brazil, Canada, and India.<sup>1 </sup>The U.S. remains the world’s largest economy and is also the largest recipient of foreign direct investment in the world. Over the last ten years, U.S. affiliates of foreign companies have employed more than five million workers, the majority of which are high-paying manufacturing jobs. On average, jobs created by FDI in United States pay up to 30% more.<sup>2</sup>  However, due to global capital mobility and increased foreign competition, we need to take steps to maintain and grow our share of global investment.</p>
<p>Historically, we have left our states and cities to compete for investments with a country’s investment promotion agency, limiting our opportunities to clearly demonstrate our commitment to attracting investment and to leverage our advantages as a top destination for investment. In 2011, through Executive Order, the U.S. launched SelectUSA, the first Federal effort to promote and facilitate inbound business investment. The E.O. created the Interagency Investment Working Group (IIWG) to further design and implement the first-ever coordinated U.S. investment promotion authority. As a driver for success, the global investment team, consisting of both SelectUSA headquarters in DC and investment teams at posts led by Ambassadors, will increase the number of active investment cases touched to encourage business investments.</p>
<p>At the first SelectUSA Investment Summit in Oct 31-Nov. 1 2013, the President reformed SelectUSA, creating a number of firsts: for the first time there will be a clear system for advocacy for high-priority, job-creating investments, driven by the most senior Administration officials all the way up to the President; for the first time there will be a single point of contact for ready investors looking to bring jobs and production to the U.S.; lastly, the Administration is engaging in unprecedented coordinated support for states and localities to attract investment.</p>
<p>Key contributing agencies to the Job-Creating Investment CAP goal include the Department of Commerce, Small Business Administration, US Department of Agriculture, Department of State, Department of Homeland Security, and Export-Import Bank of the U.S.</p>

Over time, the process and legal requirements for the permitting and review of major infrastructure projects have developed in a siloed and ad-hoc way, creating complex processes that in some cases have taken years or longer to complete.  Although there are several reasons why a major infrastructure project may be delayed (including applicant funding uncertainty and state and local reviews), over the past three years the Administration has undertaken an ambitious effort to modernize the Federal government’s role in permitting and review processes.</p>
<p>To ensure his Administration took action to modernize these permitting and review processes, on March 22, 2012, the President signed Executive Order 13604, Improving Performance of Federal Permitting and Review of Infrastructure Projects and subsequently a Presidential Memorandum on May 17, 2013, charging an interagency Steering Committee to lead the development of a plan to turn best practices into standard practice.  This Implementation Plan identifies four strategies, 15 reforms, and nearly 100 both near-term and long-term milestones.  The strategies are:</p>
<ul><li>Strategy 1: Institutionalize Interagency Coordination and Transparency, by formalizing interagency coordination policies, including early identification of a lead agency; synchronizing Federal review and permitting processes and decisions; standardizing the use of the Infrastructure Permitting Dashboard; and identifying best practices for early engagement with State, Local and Tribal governments.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Strategy 2:  Improve Project Planning, Siting, and Application Quality by developing tools to assist project applicants in planning for a major infrastructure project and support effective and timely decision-making by agency staff once the Federal processes begins. </li>
</ul><ul><li>Strategy 3: Improve Permitting Reviews and Mitigation by supporting agency staff in effectively implementing existing regulations, policies, and guidance as well as identifying barriers. This strategy also includes policies to facilitate advance planning for the mitigation of project impacts and landscape- or watershed-level approaches to mitigation, where appropriate.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Strategy 4: Drive Continued Improvement.  Fully implementing these actions and achieving the President’s goal will require a team dedicated to implementing the reforms on an interagency basis, further analyze agency processes, and identify additional reforms.  This strategy includes a proposal to establish a dedicated interagency team to support the ongoing improvement of Federal permitting and review responsibilities for major infrastructure projects.  In addition, this strategy includes a proposal to develop reliable metrics to track timeframes and outcomes for communities and the environment.</li>

Advances in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) have long been central to our Nation’s ability to manufacture better and smarter products, improve health care, develop cleaner and more efficient domestic energy sources, preserve the environment, safeguard national security, and grow the economy. For the United States to maintain its preeminent position in the world it will be essential that the Nation continues to lead in STEM, but evidence indicates that current educational pathways are not leading to a sufficiently large and well-trained STEM workforce to achieve this goal, nor is the U.S. education system cultivating a culture of STEM education necessary for a STEM-literate public. Thus it is essential that the United States enhance U.S. students’ engagement in STEM disciplines and inspire and equip many more students to excel in STEM fields.</p>
<p>A number of Federal agencies place a high priority on STEM education and have developed education initiatives unique to their agency’s mission, needs, and resources.  To better leverage Federal assets, expertise, and partnerships toward a goal of national importance, a cross agency priority to improve STEM education has been developed to increase agency coordination and use of evidence-based approaches to improve P-12 STEM instruction, increase and sustain youth and public engagement in STEM, enhance the STEM experience of undergraduate students, better serve groups historically underrepresented in STEM fields, design graduate education for tomorrow’s STEM workforce, build new models for leveraging assets and expertise, and build and use evidence-based approaches. </p>

  <div class="views-field views-field-field-cag-overview-revision-id">    <span class="views-label views-label-field-cag-overview-revision-id">Overview: </span>    <div class="field-content"><p>The American people deserve a Government that is responsive to their needs. Citizens and businesses expect government services to be well-designed, efficient, and generally comparable to the services they receive from leading private sector organizations. Whether they call the IRS for an answer to a tax question or visit a Social Security Administration office to adjust their benefits, they should experience high-quality interactions with the Federal Government. Despite some important strides to improve customer service over the past fifteen years, too often many Federal Government services fail to meet the expectations of citizens and business, creating unnecessary hassle and cost for citizens, businesses, and the government itself.  The Federal Government must keep pace with the public’s expectations and transform its customer services – soliciting regular customer feedback, streamlining processes, and delivering consistent quality service across customer channels.</p>
<p>To that end, in April 2011 the President issued an<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/27/executive-order-streamlining-service-delivery-and-improving-customer-ser" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/27/executive-order-streamlining-service-delivery-and-improving-customer-ser">Executive Order</a> requiring each agency to develop a customer service plan that identified implementation steps for their customer service activities, including a "signature initiative" that uses technology to improve the customer experience. Agencies posted the plans on their Open Government websites in October 2011, and this goal will build on these plans to streamline and improve customer service delivery.</p>
<p>To build upon the progress being made by individual agencies, the Administration is taking action to deliver improved customer service across the Federal enterprise.  The Administration will:</p>
<ul><li><em>Streamline transactions.</em>  Too often the processes and procedures of government have been developed piecemeal over time, and have not been regularly reexamined to ensure they are designed with the user experience in mind.  The Administration will identify transactions with a high impact on a significant number of citizens and streamline processes, better meet customer needs, and use performance measures to improve services.  This includes areas such as TSA security screening, veterans’ pension and disability applications, income-based repayment of student loans, Social Security, and taxpayer assistance.</li>
<li><em>Develop standards for high impact services.</em>  Citizen expectations for government services are continually increasing, driven by improvements in technology and the high quality services provided by the private sector.  Government leaders have a responsibility to understand customer expectations and service needs, and continually evaluate and improve their effectiveness in meeting those needs.  To facilitate this, many government programs that provide direct services to the public can benefit from setting customer service standards, clearly communicating these standards to customers, and ensuring these standards are being met.  The Administration will identify best practices in setting customer service standards, such as placing an emphasis on first contact resolution, and facilitate implementation of these practices for high impact services.</li>
<li><em>Utilize technology to improve the customer experience.</em>  The Administration will work to deliver world-class customer services to citizens by making it faster and easier for individuals and businesses to complete transactions with government online.  Given the continually growing importance of online services, the Administration has established a separate Cross-Agency Priority Goal to focus resources and attention on this priority area. </li>

The Administration will work with agencies to utilize existing authorities to attract top talent and consult with Agencies, the Office of Personnel Management, and Congressional stakeholders to expand the use of flexible hiring authorities. The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will also work with Agencies to incubate and scale new approaches to the design, development and delivery of top digital services and transactions.</li>
<li>Get the best companies working with government. The Administration’s efforts in this area will focus on streamlining the Federal IT acquisition process. Specific initiatives include creating more visibility of contracting opportunities for small, innovative companies; maximizing the use of available contracting flexibilities and best practices; and recommending administrative changes to the IT procurement processes.</li>
<li>Put the right processes and practices in place to drive outcomes and accountability. OMB will create and apply a new oversight and management process to highest impact IT investments in the Federal government. This process will include the best IT development and management approaches employed by the public and private sectors.  Lessons learned from this oversight process will be used to expand best practices across all agency IT investments.</li>

Today, proposals for contracts are lengthy, overly prescriptive, and laden with Government-specific requirements. There is also staggering duplication of contracts across Government and very little information sharing between agencies on pricing or other important contractual information. In order to fundamentally improve how taxpayer dollars are used in the Federal contracting space, the Administration is embarking on a comprehensive initiative to enhance collaboration and cooperation and drive greater innovation and improved performance through the implementation of Category Management.</p>
<p>This cross-agency priority (CAP) goal is focused on category management and will build on the progress made in the strategic sourcing initiative, leveraging the consolidated purchasing power of the Government to buy smarter and reduce duplication.  Category management is a new, more strategic approach that will enable the federal government to buy smarter and more like a single enterprise.  It involves identifying core areas of spend, developing heightened levels of expertise, leveraging shared best practices, providing streamlined solutions for acquisition, and managing supply and demand.  The objective is to increase efficiency and effectiveness while reducing costs and redundancies.  The first area of focus for category management is information technology and the CAP goal will support this initiative.  The objectives of the Category Management CAP goal will be expanded as the Category Management Leadership Council endorses other areas of focus.  The CAP Goal metrics can be found on the “supporting materials tabs” and progress updates will begin in the final Quarter of FY15.  </p>

If we are focused, committed, systematic, and intentional, we can make the sort of transformative changes in our service delivery approach that have altered the course of the commercial retail marketplace and reinvigorated American manufacturing. </p>
<p>We need to commit to driving efficiencies by creating opportunities to leverage existing resources and pool the government’s buying power.  This involves building common standards for underlying support activities and systems and driving out redundancy in administrative service provision.  It means changing agency expectations and incentives for spending.  And it means rethinking the way that the government considers and funds long-term investments in the systems and infrastructure that support customer service delivery. </p>
<p>The Federal Government will leverage the Executive Councils to develop common standards and benchmarks to measure shared service utilization, performance, and cost. Mandate those standards and benchmarks for common administrative services. From these standards and benchmarks we will drive efficiencies and greater performance by: 1) increasing the capacity of the Federal Shared Service Providers (SSPs) at DOI, USDA, Treasury, HHS, DOT and DOD; and 2) requiring use of lower-cost, higher-performing Shared Services for all agencies and SSPs which cannot meet established targets. We will target the following areas for Shared Services (listed in order of priority): financial, HR, technology, and acquisition.</p>

<p>The Administration will sustain and intensify these efforts in the second term by:</p>
<ul><li>Establishing cost and quality benchmarks for core/administrative operations, such as HR, Finance, Acquisition, and IT.  We will leverage the agency executive councils to develop common standards and benchmarks to measure shared service utilization, performance, and cost.  We will then use those standards and benchmarks for common administrative services as the baseline for driving continuous improvements in performance.</li>
<li>Cutting improper payments.

<p>The Administration has made significant progress in improving the management of information resources to increase interoperability and openness. In executive order 13642 President Obama outlined a clear vision for “Making Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information” wherever possible and legally permissible. The subsequently released Open Data Policy (OMB memorandum M-13-13) directed agencies to effectively “manage the information as a strategic asset” throughout its lifecycle and make data open by default to the extent permitted by law, while ensuring strict controls to safeguard individual privacy, confidentiality, and national security. </p>
<p>As a direct result, Americans are getting better access to government information and services they need. Homeowners who are struggling to pay their mortgages now get prompt, clear responses because companies are competing based on open consumer financial product complaint data published by CFPB, and can stay in their homes. Similarly, patients can now comparison shop to see which hospitals have the best outcomes and best prices thanks to data published by Medicaid and HHS—including a new dataset that for the first time shows what hospitals charge for inpatient services associated with the 100 most common kinds of hospital stays, revealing huge variations in hospital charges across the country and even within metro areas.</p>
<p>To drive further impact and results, the Open Data CAP Goal will focus on a series of government-wide objectives, strategies and major metrics that facilitate and gauge the outcome-oriented and management improvement goals of Open Data.  Metrics will prioritize three channels of impact measurement: impact on economic value creation organizations, impact on existing public program outcomes, and impact on internal government efficiency.  </p>

Though changes to policy or law may ultimately be needed to address workforce and cultural challenges across government, we can and should take actions to maximize the impact of our workforce within the existing environment.  We propose to:</p>
<ul><li>Create a Culture of Excellence and Engagement to Enable Higher Performance.  We will foster a culture of excellence by using data-driven approaches to enhance management, performance, and innovation across the current Federal workforce.  Specifically, we will focus on employee engagement (measured by employee views about their leaders, supervisors, and work experience), as multiple evaluations have demonstrated a strong correlation between employee engagement and an organization’s productivity.  Agencies can now get access to this data for over 13,000 work-level units across the country (up from just a few hundred units four years ago).  This level of specificity in data will provide agency managers with actionable information to target areas where improvement is needed most and where there are management best practices that can provide a model for success.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul><li>Build a World-Class Federal Management Team Starting with the Senior Executive Service (SES). To ensure a first-class Federal workforce long-term, we will invest in our civil service leadership by taking administrative actions that result in a broader experience and skill base across the Federal Executive Corps.  This includes addressing the “pain points” in the hiring process and enhancing training and accountability over the terms of their service.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul><li>Enable Agencies to Hire the Best Talent from All Segments of Society.  We will collaborate with Federal stakeholders and labor groups to ensure a balanced strategic approach to improving hiring outcomes. In the short term, we will identify and address the erosion of the original flexibilities of Title 5.  In the long term, we will work closely with labor unions and use demonstration projects and/or legislation and regulatory changes to ensure that our hiring processes attract and retain America’s talent.  We will measure the success of this effort by assessing manager satisfaction with the quality of both applicants and their hires after six months on the job. </li>

                    <p>Agencies establish a variety of organizational goals to drive progress toward key outcomes for the American people. Long-term strategic goals articulate clear statements of what the agency wants to achieve to advance its mission and address relevant national problems, needs, challenges and opportunities. Strategic objectives define the outcome or management impact the agency is trying to achieve, and also include the agency's role. Each strategic objective is tracked through a suite of performance goals, indicators and other evidence.

                            <div class='thingtoshoworhide' style='display: none'><p>In 2010, the President and Congress agreed upon an ambitious new direction for NASA, laying the groundwork for a sustainable program of exploration and innovation. This new direction extends the life of the International Space Station, supports the growing commercial space industry, and addresses important scientific challenges while continuing our commitment to robust human space exploration, science, and aeronautics programs. NASA works closely with Congress, its international partners, educators, industry, the public, and other stakeholders to determine its priorities in order to lay the foundation for remarkable discoveries here on Earth and deep in space which will lead to myriad benefits for United States and people around the world. As such, NASA’s Agency Priority Goals represent a subset of key priorities set by the Administration and Congress, including the International Space Station and commercial transportation providers to reach it, as well as the Space Launch System/Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle to allow American astronauts to reach ambitious destinations in the future. All of these priorities are underpinned by  key investments in space technology. In addition, NASA continues to work towards key activities such as the James Webb Space Telescope building on Hubble's incredible success, as well as a roadmap to reach Mars by 2030.   </p>
<p>Congressional consultations occur in a variety of ways, including Agency budget planning and submissions, discussion with White House staff, Committee Members and staff, responses to legislative and Executive Acts, mandates and initiatives, participation through science councils, and other forums. Specifically for these Agency Priority Goals, NASA selected among its programs and priorities the most appropriate goals based on Executive branch guidance and provided those to Congress for review and feedback.</p>

We want to open new frontiers beyond low Earth orbit to humankind. NASA is expanding human exploration by developing the capability to transport humans to and from deep space, enabling the exploration of other planets and asteroids within our solar system using innovative, advanced technologies.</p>
<p>As a starting point, exploring deep space requires the capability to transport cargo and crew beyond low Earth orbit, or farther than 2,000 kilometers beyond Earth. NASA is developing a new transportation system that includes a crew capsule, a heavy-lift launch vehicle, and supporting ground facilities and systems.</p>
<p>NASA is developing technologies to enable the additional capabilities that will be required the farther away from Earth we travel. These include the capabilities for in-space propulsion, in-space operations, long-duration habitation, and other systems to support humans in hostile environments. Precursor robotics, robotic missions that investigate candidate destinations and provide vital information to prepare for human explorers, will lay the groundwork for humans to achieve new milestones in deep space.</p>
<p>The capability to transport humans to and from deep space will leverage incremental development of exploration capabilities that seed future discoveries and innovation, and eventually lead to creation of a permanent, long-term human space presence in the solar system. Our exploration of deep space will reward us with new knowledge. While new knowledge increases our understanding of our planet, our solar system, our universe, and ourselves, Americans expect tangible benefits and applications that we can use on Earth. If the past is prologue, scientists and entrepreneurs will generate new uses for the knowledge and technology resulting from NASA’s investments in exploration systems, and this in turn will grow the U.S. economy.</p>

                                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>NASA is developing the nation’s first human deep-space exploration capability in the form of the Space Launch System (SLS) and the Orion crew vehicle. With the supporting Exploration Ground Systems (EGS), the SLS and Orion will carry humans farther into space than ever before, and are essential for exploration of deep space, including future human exploration of Mars. Human space exploration inspires the nation to seek knowledge through scientific discovery, advancing our understanding of the universe. As the foundation of the human exploration endeavor which will drive the Space Economy, these programs are fueling the creation of new industries, job growth, and the demand for a highly skilled workforce. NASA’s human exploration portfolio will be the initial catalyst for a better life on Earth, advancing American leadership in space, and creating a path for peace, diplomacy, and global cooperation.</p>
<p>
NASA’s first flight of the SLS with the Orion crew vehicle, the EM-1, is currently targeted for launch in FY 2018. The EM-1 is the first flight of an uncrewed mission that will orbit the Moon and return safely to Earth. The EM-1 flight will exercise multiple systems and technical approaches in preparation for a crewed mission. To successfully achieve the goal of launching EM-1 in FY 2018, the SLS launch vehicle, Orion spacecraft and EGS programs will complete several significant design reviews as well as test flight and ground hardware and software prior to launch. The successful completion of these milestones, in conjunction with the final assembly and test of the launch vehicle and spacecraft hardware at the Kennedy Space Center launch site, will enable the successful launch of the EM-1 flight. By the end of FY 2015, all three programs-SLS, Orion and EGS-will have completed their individual Critical Design Reviews (CDRs), ensuring the whole exploration system progresses toward the EM-1 flight in FY 2018.</p>
<p>The SLS program CDR is the culmination of the various SLS elements’ final design reviews and will be held by the end of FY 2015. The program CDR will assess the ability of the overall launch vehicle design to meet the mission requirements with acceptable risk and appropriate margins within the defined cost, schedule and technical constraints.</p>
<p>Similar to the SLS, the Orion program CDR will be the culmination of several more detailed reviews. Critical flight data from the Exploration Flight Test-1 mission, the first Orion test flight to be launched in 2014, will provide information to finalize the design of the Orion spacecraft. Additionally, one of the final design reviews will focus on the Service Module, which will be developed for NASA by the European Space Agency (ESA). NASA is leveraging its strong international partnership with ESA-established in the development of the International Space Station (ISS). ESA will provide the European Service Module, a critical Orion element, in support of the first integrated test flight on the SLS launch vehicle, EM-1 in FY 2018. The Orion program CDR will assess the ability of the overall spacecraft design to meet the mission requirements with acceptable risk and appropriate margins within the defined cost, schedule and technical constraints.</p>
<p>The Exploration Ground Systems program CDR will be the culmination of several system-level final design reviews. For example, the mobile launcher (ML), which will provide all of the necessary ground system connections and services to the SLS launch vehicle and Orion spacecraft, will complete structural modifications by the end of this goal. After the structural modifications are complete, additional modifications of the ML will continue through FY 2017. The EGS program CDR will assess the ability of the overall ground systems designs in meeting the mission requirements with acceptable risk and appropriate margins within the defined cost, schedule and technical constraints.</p>

Enabling a U.S. industry-based capability can facilitate development of a commercial market, providing new high-technology jobs and reduce the cost of human access to space. A successful commercial market will further open the frontier for space exploration.</p>
<p>NASA is focused on ensuring that the current phase of crew system development, the Commercial Crew integrated Capability, (CCiCap), is successful at maturing the system designs and completing initial testing. Under CCiCap, U.S. space industry partners are working to mature designs of their integrated crew transportation systems, including spacecraft, launch vehicle, ground and mission systems.</p>
<p>In December 2012, NASA initiated the first phase of crew transportation systems certification by awarding three Certification Products Contracts (CPC). Under CPC, commercial partners are working with NASA to develop products that meet the agency's flight safety and performance requirements and specifications. This includes certification across all aspects of the integrated system, including the spacecraft, launch vehicle, and ground and mission operations. Integrated system verification plans, hazard reports, alternate standards and certification plans are being developed to ensure safe, crewed missions to and from the space station.</p>
<p>The second phase of certification will begin after CPC, and will involve a full and open competition. The second phase of certification will involve final systems development, qualification and acceptance testing, orbital demonstration flights, and initial service flights of NASA crew to the International Space Station. By the end of FY 2015, measurable progress on this second phase of certification will be evidenced. Competition will be maintained.</p>

Earth and the other planets of our solar system reside in this vast extended atmosphere of the Sun, called the heliosphere, which is made of electrified and magnetized matter entwined with penetrating radiation and energetic particles. To increase our understanding of the heliopshere, we seek to answer fundamental questions about this system’s behavior: What causes the Sun to vary? How do geospace, planetary space environments, and the heliosphere respond? What are the impacts to humanity?</p>
<p>The emerging science of interplanetary space weather is crucial to NASA’s human and robotic exploration objectives beyond Earth’s orbit. Humans are presently confined to low Earth orbit, where the planetary magnetic field and the body of Earth itself provide substantial protection against solar storms. Eventually, though, astronauts will travel to distant places where natural shielding is considerably less. Our new long-term exploration initiatives directly rely on our ability to successfully understand, predict, and mitigate impacts of interplanetary space weather.</p>

<p>Robotic exploration is the principal method we use to explore the solar system, and is an essential precursor to human exploration of space. Ground based observations, experiments, theoretical work, and analysis of extraterrestrial materials supplement our space-based assets. Each progression from flybys, to orbiting spacecraft, to landers and rovers, to sample return missions helps advance our understanding of the formation of planetary bodies, the chemical and physical history of the solar system, and the conditions that are capable of sustaining life. The successful Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity, for example, is allowing us to explore the potential habitats for past life on Mars.</p>
<p>Our investment in planetary science helps us protect Earth by identifying and characterizing celestial bodies and environments that may pose threats to our planet. Further, planetary science programs add to the pool of knowledge necessary for future human exploration missions. In support of the Asteroid Grand Challenge, we will enhance our Near Earth Objects Observation program to improve the detection and characterization of potential asteroid candidates for robotic and crewed exploration.<br />

How did we get here? Are we alone? The scope of astrophysics is truly breathtaking, ranging from the birth of the universe and the development of stars and galaxies over cosmic time, to the search for life on planets around other stars.</p>
<p>NASA’s astrophysics missions explore the extreme physical conditions of the universe and study the building blocks of our own existence at the most basic level: the space, time, matter, and energy that created the universe. Our telescopes have already measured the current age of the universe to be about 13.7 billion years and have uncovered remarkable new phenomena, such as the mysterious dark energy that dominates the universe. In the future, they will probe the origin and destiny of the universe, including the first moments of the Big Bang and the nature of black holes, dark energy, dark matter, and gravity.</p>
<p>We seek to understand the origin and evolution of the universe, as well as understand the processes for life on other planets. NASA’s observatories allow astronomers to explore the processes of formation of stars, galaxies, and planets. We have observed star formation occurring when the universe was at only a few percent its current age. The upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will allow us to uncover the mysteries of star formation at an even earlier age, as well as study in detail planets around other stars.</p>
<p>We are navigating a voyage of unprecedented scope and ambition: seeking to discover and study planets orbiting around other stars and to explore whether they could harbor life. NASA’s astrophysics missions, in conjunction with ground-based telescopes, have already confirmed the existence of over 2,000 extrasolar planets. Of even greater interest, we are now finding that there are many small, rocky extrasolar planets where liquid water could exist. In the future, NASA’s telescopes will continue this breathtaking journey, discovering new planets and observing signatures that could indicate possibilities for life.</p>

                                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>The James Webb Space Telescope (Webb) Program will produce an astronomical observatory capable of watching the universe light up after the Big Bang. It will revolutionize humankind's understanding of the Cosmos and our place in it.  This observatory is key for meeting NASA's strategic objective to discover how the universe works, explore how it began and evolved, and search for life on planets around other stars. Webb is NASA's new telescope that will allow us to explore deeper into space and see things that even the Hubble Space Telescope cannot see. Webb's new technologies, like those developed for the backplane components, are critical to the mission's success.</p>
<p>The Webb observatory has a deployable, segmented primary mirror made up of 18 hexagonal mirrors. When combined into a single structure, these computer-controlled mirrors will form a single crisp image.  To form these sharp images, the mirror segments must be firmly held by an extremely rigid and stable structure known as the primary mirror backplane.  This backplane can be thought of as a skeleton on which we hang the mirror segments. The backplane support structure attaches to the primary mirror backplane and holds the science instrument module.  The science instrument module contains the observatory's cameras and spectrographs.  The backplane support structure provides a rigid and thermally stable platform to guarantee that the science instruments and telescope mirror stay in perfect alignment.</p>
<p>The construction of the primary mirror backplane and backplane support structure is the pacing item in the schedule for the telescope.  Keeping these items on schedule is vital to keeping Webb on track for its planned October 2018 launch.  From now through FY 2015, the parts of the backplane (center section, wings, backplane support fixture, and test equipment) will undergo their final phases of manufacturing and testing before being assembled into a single unit.  This single unit will be delivered to the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD.  Once the completed unit is available, NASA will place the 18 mirror segments into the backplane. </p>
<p>Following the completion of the telescope, the Webb program will embark on the next major integration and test portion of its schedule.  In 2016, the program will begin the integration of the telescope with the science instrument module (denoted as Optical Telescope plus Integrated Science instrument module: OTIS).  Also in 2016, the spacecraft will begin its integration steps.  In 2017, NASA will complete the OTIS testing.  The spacecraft and sunshield will be integrated and tested in 2017.  Finally, in 2018, the complete integration of the observatory will occur, joining the OTIS and the spacecraft in preparation for their launch in October.</p>

</p>
                                                                                  <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>NASA is developing the nation’s first human deep-space exploration capability in the form of the Space Launch System (SLS) and the Orion crew vehicle. With the supporting Exploration Ground Systems (EGS), the SLS and Orion will carry humans farther into space than ever before, and are essential for exploration of deep space, including future human exploration of Mars. Human space exploration inspires the nation to seek knowledge through scientific discovery, advancing our understanding of the universe. As the foundation of the human exploration endeavor which will drive the Space Economy, these programs are fueling the creation of new industries, job growth, and the demand for a highly skilled workforce. NASA’s human exploration portfolio will be the initial catalyst for a better life on Earth, advancing American leadership in space, and creating a path for peace, diplomacy, and global cooperation.</p>
<p>
NASA’s first flight of the SLS with the Orion crew vehicle, the EM-1, is currently targeted for launch in FY 2018. The EM-1 is the first flight of an uncrewed mission that will orbit the Moon and return safely to Earth. The EM-1 flight will exercise multiple systems and technical approaches in preparation for a crewed mission. To successfully achieve the goal of launching EM-1 in FY 2018, the SLS launch vehicle, Orion spacecraft and EGS programs will complete several significant design reviews as well as test flight and ground hardware and software prior to launch. The successful completion of these milestones, in conjunction with the final assembly and test of the launch vehicle and spacecraft hardware at the Kennedy Space Center launch site, will enable the successful launch of the EM-1 flight. By the end of FY 2015, all three programs-SLS, Orion and EGS-will have completed their individual Critical Design Reviews (CDRs), ensuring the whole exploration system progresses toward the EM-1 flight in FY 2018.</p>
<p>The SLS program CDR is the culmination of the various SLS elements’ final design reviews and will be held by the end of FY 2015. The program CDR will assess the ability of the overall launch vehicle design to meet the mission requirements with acceptable risk and appropriate margins within the defined cost, schedule and technical constraints.</p>
<p>Similar to the SLS, the Orion program CDR will be the culmination of several more detailed reviews. Critical flight data from the Exploration Flight Test-1 mission, the first Orion test flight to be launched in 2014, will provide information to finalize the design of the Orion spacecraft. Additionally, one of the final design reviews will focus on the Service Module, which will be developed for NASA by the European Space Agency (ESA). NASA is leveraging its strong international partnership with ESA-established in the development of the International Space Station (ISS). ESA will provide the European Service Module, a critical Orion element, in support of the first integrated test flight on the SLS launch vehicle, EM-1 in FY 2018. The Orion program CDR will assess the ability of the overall spacecraft design to meet the mission requirements with acceptable risk and appropriate margins within the defined cost, schedule and technical constraints.</p>
<p>The Exploration Ground Systems program CDR will be the culmination of several system-level final design reviews. For example, the mobile launcher (ML), which will provide all of the necessary ground system connections and services to the SLS launch vehicle and Orion spacecraft, will complete structural modifications by the end of this goal. After the structural modifications are complete, additional modifications of the ML will continue through FY 2017. The EGS program CDR will assess the ability of the overall ground systems designs in meeting the mission requirements with acceptable risk and appropriate margins within the defined cost, schedule and technical constraints.</p>

Enabling a U.S. industry-based capability can facilitate development of a commercial market, providing new high-technology jobs and reduce the cost of human access to space. A successful commercial market will further open the frontier for space exploration.</p>
<p>NASA is focused on ensuring that the current phase of crew system development, the Commercial Crew integrated Capability, (CCiCap), is successful at maturing the system designs and completing initial testing. Under CCiCap, U.S. space industry partners are working to mature designs of their integrated crew transportation systems, including spacecraft, launch vehicle, ground and mission systems.</p>
<p>In December 2012, NASA initiated the first phase of crew transportation systems certification by awarding three Certification Products Contracts (CPC). Under CPC, commercial partners are working with NASA to develop products that meet the agency's flight safety and performance requirements and specifications. This includes certification across all aspects of the integrated system, including the spacecraft, launch vehicle, and ground and mission operations. Integrated system verification plans, hazard reports, alternate standards and certification plans are being developed to ensure safe, crewed missions to and from the space station.</p>
<p>The second phase of certification will begin after CPC, and will involve a full and open competition. The second phase of certification will involve final systems development, qualification and acceptance testing, orbital demonstration flights, and initial service flights of NASA crew to the International Space Station. By the end of FY 2015, measurable progress on this second phase of certification will be evidenced. Competition will be maintained.</p>

                                                                                  <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>The James Webb Space Telescope (Webb) Program will produce an astronomical observatory capable of watching the universe light up after the Big Bang. It will revolutionize humankind's understanding of the Cosmos and our place in it.  This observatory is key for meeting NASA's strategic objective to discover how the universe works, explore how it began and evolved, and search for life on planets around other stars. Webb is NASA's new telescope that will allow us to explore deeper into space and see things that even the Hubble Space Telescope cannot see. Webb's new technologies, like those developed for the backplane components, are critical to the mission's success.</p>
<p>The Webb observatory has a deployable, segmented primary mirror made up of 18 hexagonal mirrors. When combined into a single structure, these computer-controlled mirrors will form a single crisp image.  To form these sharp images, the mirror segments must be firmly held by an extremely rigid and stable structure known as the primary mirror backplane.  This backplane can be thought of as a skeleton on which we hang the mirror segments. The backplane support structure attaches to the primary mirror backplane and holds the science instrument module.  The science instrument module contains the observatory's cameras and spectrographs.  The backplane support structure provides a rigid and thermally stable platform to guarantee that the science instruments and telescope mirror stay in perfect alignment.</p>
<p>The construction of the primary mirror backplane and backplane support structure is the pacing item in the schedule for the telescope.  Keeping these items on schedule is vital to keeping Webb on track for its planned October 2018 launch.  From now through FY 2015, the parts of the backplane (center section, wings, backplane support fixture, and test equipment) will undergo their final phases of manufacturing and testing before being assembled into a single unit.  This single unit will be delivered to the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD.  Once the completed unit is available, NASA will place the 18 mirror segments into the backplane. </p>
<p>Following the completion of the telescope, the Webb program will embark on the next major integration and test portion of its schedule.  In 2016, the program will begin the integration of the telescope with the science instrument module (denoted as Optical Telescope plus Integrated Science instrument module: OTIS).  Also in 2016, the spacecraft will begin its integration steps.  In 2017, NASA will complete the OTIS testing.  The spacecraft and sunshield will be integrated and tested in 2017.  Finally, in 2018, the complete integration of the observatory will occur, joining the OTIS and the spacecraft in preparation for their launch in October.</p>

Studying Earth as a single complex system is essential to understanding the causes and consequences of climate change and other global environmental concerns. NASA addresses the issues and opportunities of climate change and environmental sensitivity by answering the following questions through our Earth Science programs: How is the global Earth system changing? What causes these changes in the Earth system? How will Earth’s systems change in the future? How can Earth system science provide societal benefits?</p>
<p>NASA’s Earth science programs shape an interdisciplinary view of Earth, exploring the interaction among the atmosphere, oceans, ice sheets, land surface interior, and life itself, which enables scientists to measure global and climate changes and to inform decisions by Government, organizations, and people in the United States and around the world. We make the data collected and results generated by our missions accessible to other agencies and organizations to improve the products and services they provide, including air quality indices, disaster prediction and response, agricultural yield projections, and aviation safety.<br />

By September 30, 2017, NASA will have begun integration and testing of the Exploration Mission (EM)-1 Orion Crew Module (CM), including the first power-on of the vehicle; delivered all four EM-1 Space Launch System (SLS) Core Stage RS-25 engines to the Michoud Assembly Facility in preparation for integration into the Core Stage; and completed construction of Exploration Ground Systems (EGS) Pad B.</p>
</p>
                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>NASA is developing key elements of the Nation’s first human deep-space exploration capability in the form of the Space Launch System (SLS) and the Orion crew vehicle. With the support of Exploration Ground Systems (EGS), the SLS and Orion will carry humans farther into space than ever before, and are essential for exploration of deep space, including future human exploration of Mars. Human space exploration inspires the Nation. As the foundation of the human exploration endeavor, these programs are also building a highly skilled workforce. NASA’s human exploration portfolio will advance American leadership in space, and create a path for peace, diplomacy, and global cooperation.</p>
<p>NASA’s first flight of the SLS and the Orion crew vehicle, Exploration Mission (EM)-1, will be an uncrewed mission beyond low Earth orbit with the Orion capsule returning safely to Earth. The EM-1 flight will exercise multiple systems and technical approaches in preparation for a crewed mission. In order to achieve this goal, the SLS launch vehicle, Orion spacecraft, and EGS programs will complete several significant design reviews, as well as test flight and ground hardware and software prior to launch. The successful completion of these milestones, in conjunction with the final assembly and test of the launch vehicle and spacecraft hardware at the Kennedy Space Center launch site, will enable the successful launch of the EM-1 flight. By the end of FY 2017, the SLS, Orion, and EGS programs will be past critical design and into system qualification and major flight hardware production.</p>
<p>For this reporting period, the SLS program will complete a number of significant development, qualification, and production milestones. SLS will complete the second of two qualification tests of the five segment solid rocket motor, the successful completion of which will clear the boosters for flight. Production of core stage (hydrogen and oxygen tanks, intertank, and forward and engine sections) and interim cryogenic propulsion stage qualification hardware will be complete and ready for testing. SLS will also start production of flight hardware, including the launch vehicle stage adaptor and multipurpose crew vehicle stage adaptor. The four RS-25 core stage engines allocated for EM-1 will go through testing in preparation for integration into the EM-1 core and green run testing in FY 2018. Finally, SLS will complete the development of green run and EM-1 flight software.</p>
<p>The Orion Program will complete its Critical Design Review and continue manufacturing and testing of the EM-1 flight vehicle. Manufacturing has already begun on the EM-1 Crew Module’s pressure vessel (the living space within Orion that provides life support for the crew). It will be delivered to the Kennedy Space Center in FY 2016, and then assembly of the Crew Module can begin. This will also be the first flight of the European Service Module, a milestone in the long human spaceflight partnership between NASA and the European Space Agency. The structural testing of the European Service Module will occur in this reporting period. In late FY 2017, the EM-1 Orion crew and service module assembly will undergo environmental testing at Glenn Research Center’s Plum Brook Station in Ohio.</p>
<p>The Exploration Ground Systems program will conduct a Critical Design Review in early FY 2016 to assess the ability of the overall ground systems designs in meeting the mission requirements with acceptable risk and appropriate margins within the defined cost, schedule, and technical constraints. In FY 2016, the program will conduct its System Integration Review. These reviews will be the culmination of several system-level final design and implementation reviews. In late FY 2017, several components of Exploration Ground Systems plan to kick off their respective Operational Readiness Reviews. The system, including any enabling products, will be reviewed and a determination made if it is ready to be placed in an operational status. The kickoff will initiate a process to capture all applicable lessons-learned for organizational improvement and systems operations. All waivers and anomalies will have been in final evaluation and prepared for closure as appropriate. Systems hardware, software, personnel, and procedures will initiate a review to ensure they are in place to support operations. It is anticipated that some additional modifications of the mobile launcher will continue through FY 2017.</p>

</p>
                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>The James Webb Space Telescope (Webb) Program will produce an astronomical observatory capable of watching the universe light up after the Big Bang. It will revolutionize humankind's understanding of the Cosmos and our place in it. This observatory is key for meeting NASA's strategic objective to discover how the universe works, explore how it began and evolved, and search for life on planets around other stars. Webb is NASA's new telescope that will allow us to explore deeper into space and see things that even the Hubble Space Telescope cannot see. Webb's new technologies, such as those developed for the telescope backplane components, are critical to the mission's success.</p>
<p>The Webb observatory has a deployable, segmented primary mirror made up of 18 hexagonal mirrors. When combined into a single structure, these computer-controlled mirrors will form a single, crisp image. To form these sharp images, the mirror segments must be firmly held by an extremely rigid and stable structure known as the primary mirror backplane. When the backplane is populated with the already completed mirror segments, and then joined to the Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM), Webb will have a completed telescope capable of creating images.</p>
<p>Completion of OTIS, which integrates the Optical Telescope Element (OTE) and the ISIM, is a major step in the realization of the Webb mission. Keeping these items on schedule is vital to keeping Webb on track for its planned October 2018 launch. From now through FY 2017, ISIM will complete its testing, the Pathfinder structure and mirrors will reduce the risks associated with the full OTIS tests, and the OTIS test itself will occur. The OTIS test will verify that the system will deliver the required performance in terms of optical quality and sensitivity.</p>
<p>Following the integration of the telescope and science instruments, the Webb program will embark on the next major integration and test portion of its schedule. In calendar year 2017, the spacecraft and sunshield will be integrated and tested. Finally, in fiscal year 2018, the complete integration of the observatory will occur, joining the OTIS and the spacecraft/sunshield in preparation for their launch in October.</p>

NASA’s first flight of the SLS with the Orion crew vehicle, the EM-1, is currently targeted for launch in FY 2018. The EM-1 is the first flight of an uncrewed mission that will orbit the Moon and return safely to Earth. The EM-1 flight will exercise multiple systems and technical approaches in preparation for a crewed mission. To successfully achieve the goal of launching EM-1 in FY 2018, the SLS launch vehicle, Orion spacecraft and EGS programs will complete several significant design reviews as well as test flight and ground hardware and software prior to launch. The successful completion of these milestones, in conjunction with the final assembly and test of the launch vehicle and spacecraft hardware at the Kennedy Space Center launch site, will enable the successful launch of the EM-1 flight. By the end of FY 2015, all three programs-SLS, Orion and EGS-will have completed their individual Critical Design Reviews (CDRs), ensuring the whole exploration system progresses toward the EM-1 flight in FY 2018.</p>
<p>The SLS program CDR is the culmination of the various SLS elements’ final design reviews and will be held by the end of FY 2015. The program CDR will assess the ability of the overall launch vehicle design to meet the mission requirements with acceptable risk and appropriate margins within the defined cost, schedule and technical constraints.</p>
<p>Similar to the SLS, the Orion program CDR will be the culmination of several more detailed reviews. Critical flight data from the Exploration Flight Test-1 mission, the first Orion test flight to be launched in 2014, will provide information to finalize the design of the Orion spacecraft. Additionally, one of the final design reviews will focus on the Service Module, which will be developed for NASA by the European Space Agency (ESA). NASA is leveraging its strong international partnership with ESA-established in the development of the International Space Station (ISS). ESA will provide the European Service Module, a critical Orion element, in support of the first integrated test flight on the SLS launch vehicle, EM-1 in FY 2018. The Orion program CDR will assess the ability of the overall spacecraft design to meet the mission requirements with acceptable risk and appropriate margins within the defined cost, schedule and technical constraints.</p>
<p>The Exploration Ground Systems program CDR will be the culmination of several system-level final design reviews. For example, the mobile launcher (ML), which will provide all of the necessary ground system connections and services to the SLS launch vehicle and Orion spacecraft, will complete structural modifications by the end of this goal. After the structural modifications are complete, additional modifications of the ML will continue through FY 2017. The EGS program CDR will assess the ability of the overall ground systems designs in meeting the mission requirements with acceptable risk and appropriate margins within the defined cost, schedule and technical constraints.</p>

                               <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>The Commercial Crew Program is helping facilitate the development of U.S. commercial crew space transportation capabilities with the goal of achieving safe, reliable, and cost effective access to and from low Earth orbit and the International Space Station (ISS). Enabling a U.S. industry-based capability can facilitate development of a commercial market, providing new high-technology jobs and reduce the cost of human access to space. A successful commercial market will further open the frontier for space exploration.</p>
<p>NASA is focused on ensuring that the current phase of crew system development, the Commercial Crew integrated Capability, (CCiCap), is successful at maturing the system designs and completing initial testing. Under CCiCap, U.S. space industry partners are working to mature designs of their integrated crew transportation systems, including spacecraft, launch vehicle, ground and mission systems.</p>
<p>In December 2012, NASA initiated the first phase of crew transportation systems certification by awarding three Certification Products Contracts (CPC). Under CPC, commercial partners are working with NASA to develop products that meet the agency's flight safety and performance requirements and specifications. This includes certification across all aspects of the integrated system, including the spacecraft, launch vehicle, and ground and mission operations. Integrated system verification plans, hazard reports, alternate standards and certification plans are being developed to ensure safe, crewed missions to and from the space station.</p>
<p>The second phase of certification will begin after CPC, and will involve a full and open competition. The second phase of certification will involve final systems development, qualification and acceptance testing, orbital demonstration flights, and initial service flights of NASA crew to the International Space Station. By the end of FY 2015, measurable progress on this second phase of certification will be evidenced. Competition will be maintained.</p>

<p> </p>
</p>
                               <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>The James Webb Space Telescope (Webb) Program will produce an astronomical observatory capable of watching the universe light up after the Big Bang. It will revolutionize humankind's understanding of the Cosmos and our place in it.  This observatory is key for meeting NASA's strategic objective to discover how the universe works, explore how it began and evolved, and search for life on planets around other stars. Webb is NASA's new telescope that will allow us to explore deeper into space and see things that even the Hubble Space Telescope cannot see. Webb's new technologies, like those developed for the backplane components, are critical to the mission's success.</p>
<p>The Webb observatory has a deployable, segmented primary mirror made up of 18 hexagonal mirrors. When combined into a single structure, these computer-controlled mirrors will form a single crisp image.  To form these sharp images, the mirror segments must be firmly held by an extremely rigid and stable structure known as the primary mirror backplane.  This backplane can be thought of as a skeleton on which we hang the mirror segments. The backplane support structure attaches to the primary mirror backplane and holds the science instrument module.  The science instrument module contains the observatory's cameras and spectrographs.  The backplane support structure provides a rigid and thermally stable platform to guarantee that the science instruments and telescope mirror stay in perfect alignment.</p>
<p>The construction of the primary mirror backplane and backplane support structure is the pacing item in the schedule for the telescope.  Keeping these items on schedule is vital to keeping Webb on track for its planned October 2018 launch.  From now through FY 2015, the parts of the backplane (center section, wings, backplane support fixture, and test equipment) will undergo their final phases of manufacturing and testing before being assembled into a single unit.  This single unit will be delivered to the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD.  Once the completed unit is available, NASA will place the 18 mirror segments into the backplane. </p>
<p>Following the completion of the telescope, the Webb program will embark on the next major integration and test portion of its schedule.  In 2016, the program will begin the integration of the telescope with the science instrument module (denoted as Optical Telescope plus Integrated Science instrument module: OTIS).  Also in 2016, the spacecraft will begin its integration steps.  In 2017, NASA will complete the OTIS testing.  The spacecraft and sunshield will be integrated and tested in 2017.  Finally, in 2018, the complete integration of the observatory will occur, joining the OTIS and the spacecraft in preparation for their launch in October.</p>
