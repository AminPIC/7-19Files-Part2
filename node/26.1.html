                        <p>The mission of the Department of Defense (DOD) is to provide the military forces needed to deter war and to protect the security of the United States. Since the creation of America’s first army in 1775, the Department and its predecessor organizations have evolved into a global presence of three million individuals, stationed in more than 140 countries and dedicated to defending the United States by deterring and defeating aggression and coercion in critical regions. The Department embraces the core values of leadership, professionalism, and technical knowledge. Its employees are dedicated to duty, integrity, ethics, honor, courage, and loyalty.</p>

                        <p>The  Department of Defense (DoD)  is  one  of  the  nation’s  largest  employers,  with  approximately  1.4  million  Active Component,  836,000  Selected  Reserve  and  245,000  Individual  Ready  Reserve  forces;  and 735,000 appropriated and 126,000 non-appropriated civilian employees. Our military service members and civilians operate in every time zone and in every climate, and more than 450,000 of our employees serve overseas.  As one of the nation’s largest health-care providers, the DoD cares for almost 9.5 million beneficiaries. DoD executes a multibillion dollar global supply chain, manages a five million item inventory, and operates with a $500 billion dollar budget. The DoD’s real property infrastructure includes over 561,975 facilities (buildings and structures) located on 4,800 sites worldwide. These sites represent nearly 25 million acres; sized from the training ranges of nearly 3 million acres, such as Nellis Air Force Base, to single weather towers or navigational aids isolated on sites of less than one one-hundredth (0.01) of an acre. To protect the security of the United States, the Department operates approximately 5,285 aircraft and 293 ships.</p>
<p>The Department engages in Warfighting, Humanitarian Aid, Peacekeeping, Disaster Relief and Homeland Security, while simultaneously performing functions necessary to effectively and efficiently support our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines and their families.</p>
<p>The Department has five overarching Strategic Goals, as reflected in the DoD's 2015-2018 Agency Strategic Plan:</p>
<p>1.  Defeat our Adversaries, Deter War, and Defend the Nation.</p>
<p>2.  Sustain a Ready Force to Meet Mission Needs.</p>
<p>3.  Strengthen and Enhance the Health and Effectiveness of the Total Workforce.</p>
<p>4.  Achieve Dominant Capabilities through Innovation and Technical Excellence.</p>
<p>5.  Reform and Reshape the Defense Institution.</p>

<div class="intro_text">
<p>Established by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goals are a tool used to accelerate progress on a limited number of priority areas where implementation requires active collaboration between multiple agencies, overcoming organizational barriers to achieve better performance than one agency can achieve on its own.</p>
<p>Set or revised at least every four years, CAP Goals include outcome-oriented goals that cover a limited number of crosscutting policy areas as well as management goals focused on management improvements across the Federal Government in areas of financial management, strategic human capital management, information technology management, procurement and acquisition management, and real property management.</p>
<p>A series of 16 CAP Goals were announced in the 2015 Budget with clearly named accountable officials, data-driven reviews that incorporated a broad range of quantitative and qualitative inputs, and reporting to the public through a common website as a framework to drive performance improvements on cross-government collaboration and tackle government-wide management challenges affecting most agencies.</p>

<p>On June 30, 2016, the President signed into law the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 – nearly 50 years after President Johnson signed the original FOIA into law.  This critical legislation reflects the progress made by the Administration, codifies a number of openness and transparency principles, and ensures that the Administration’s track record of openness is institutionalized throughout government and carries forward for years to come.  Concurrent with the signing of the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, the White House released a Fact Sheet committing the Administration to:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Utilizing the Chief FOIA Officers Council and FOIA Advisory Committee to address FOIA’s greatest challenges;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promoting broader release of records through a “release to one is a release to all” presumption;</p>

</div>  </div>  
  <div class="views-field views-field-field-cag-overview-revision-id">    <span class="views-label views-label-field-cag-overview-revision-id">Overview: </span>    <div class="field-content"><p>On March 19, 2015, the President issued Executive Order 13693, <em>Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade</em>, which set forth ambitious climate, energy, and environmental sustainability goals for Federal agencies over the next decade.  Executive departments and agencies have been among our Nation’s leaders as the United States works to build a clean energy economy that will sustain our prosperity and the health of our people and our environment for generations to come. Federal leadership in energy, environmental water, transportation fleets, buildings, and acquisition management will continue to drive national greenhouse gas reductions and support preparations for the impacts of climate change. The Federal Government has the opportunity to significantly reduce direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2025, while at the same time fostering innovation, reducing spending, and strengthening the communities in which our Federal facilities operate. </p>
<p>Employing this strategy for the next decade calls for expanded and updated Federal environmental performance goals with a clear overarching objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions across Federal operations and the Federal supply chain.  Goals for greenhouse gas emissions reduction (40% by 2025), renewable electricity (30% by 2025), clean energy (25% by 2025), and performance contracting ($4 billion in awarded contracts by Dec. 2016) are already well established in the Federal community. The enhanced target for each of these goals will require agencies to sharpen their focus on achieving the goals through existing mechanisms and new technologies that enhance efficiency and use of clean energy.</p>
<p>CEQ and OMB have worked closely to ensure that Federal agencies understand the necessary steps to pursuing the new environmental sustainability goals and those efforts are supported by an interagency Steering Committee.  Pursuit of these sustainability goals will involve at least 25 of the largest Federal agencies. Success will be greatly enhanced by the cross-cutting nature of the goals and the similarity in the tools and procedures used for implementation.</p>
<p>While all Federal agencies have an important role to play in ensuring the Government meets its energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets, key delivery agencies include: The General Services Administration, Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Energy, National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Department of Homeland Security.</p>

In the wake of increasing threats and incidents, the President directed a series of reviews to examine current security, suitability/fitness, and credentialing processes and to recommend areas in need of reform. The interagency reviews identified problem areas and made specific recommendations, which were approved by the Performance Accountability Council (PAC). The PAC developed the Strategic Intent to build upon these efforts and create a lasting impact by providing overarching strategic direction to personnel security, suitability/fitness, and credentialing reform efforts for the next five years.  </p>
<p>The Strategic Intent represents our framework for sustaining progress mandated by the February 2014 Suitability and Security Processes Review Report to the President, the January 2016 PAC Review of Background Investigations, relevant legislation, and other key drivers. It builds on progress since the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 and the subsequent, significant reform efforts that resulted in greater standardization and alignment of suitability and security processes. Through this framework, the PAC will work with other members of the Executive Branch to drive continuous process improvement to personnel security, suitability/fitness, and credentialing programs and address evolving threats. While we cannot eliminate risk altogether, it is imperative that we work across disciplines to maximize our collective efforts to mitigate the risks we face, while ensuring appropriate protections for privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. We must ensure measures to improve these programs avoid imposing unreasonable burdens on the Federal workforce that could negatively impact operations. Therefore, the Federal Government will pursue a balanced approach by addressing the risks posed by personnel who could do significant harm by virtue of the nature of their position.</p>
<p>These reforms will further support ongoing Insider Threat Program implementation by providing earlier detection and improving the quality of vetting. The improved attention to cybersecurity will reinforce efforts to protect sensitive mission data, including personally-identifiable information. </p>

According to AT Kearney’s Foreign Direct Investment Confidence Index, confidence in the U.S. as a location for FDI is high, ranking as the top destination for investment ahead of China, Brazil, Canada, and India.<sup>1 </sup>The U.S. remains the world’s largest economy and is also the largest recipient of foreign direct investment in the world. Over the last ten years, U.S. affiliates of foreign companies have employed more than five million workers, the majority of which are high-paying manufacturing jobs. On average, jobs created by FDI in United States pay up to 30% more.<sup>2</sup>  However, due to global capital mobility and increased foreign competition, we need to take steps to maintain and grow our share of global investment.</p>
<p>Historically, we have left our states and cities to compete for investments with a country’s investment promotion agency, limiting our opportunities to clearly demonstrate our commitment to attracting investment and to leverage our advantages as a top destination for investment. In 2011, through Executive Order, the U.S. launched SelectUSA, the first Federal effort to promote and facilitate inbound business investment. The E.O. created the Interagency Investment Working Group (IIWG) to further design and implement the first-ever coordinated U.S. investment promotion authority. As a driver for success, the global investment team, consisting of both SelectUSA headquarters in DC and investment teams at posts led by Ambassadors, will increase the number of active investment cases touched to encourage business investments.</p>
<p>At the first SelectUSA Investment Summit in Oct 31-Nov. 1 2013, the President reformed SelectUSA, creating a number of firsts: for the first time there will be a clear system for advocacy for high-priority, job-creating investments, driven by the most senior Administration officials all the way up to the President; for the first time there will be a single point of contact for ready investors looking to bring jobs and production to the U.S.; lastly, the Administration is engaging in unprecedented coordinated support for states and localities to attract investment.</p>
<p>Key contributing agencies to the Job-Creating Investment CAP goal include the Department of Commerce, Small Business Administration, US Department of Agriculture, Department of State, Department of Homeland Security, and Export-Import Bank of the U.S.</p>

Over time, the process and legal requirements for the permitting and review of major infrastructure projects have developed in a siloed and ad-hoc way, creating complex processes that in some cases have taken years or longer to complete.  Although there are several reasons why a major infrastructure project may be delayed (including applicant funding uncertainty and state and local reviews), over the past three years the Administration has undertaken an ambitious effort to modernize the Federal government’s role in permitting and review processes.</p>
<p>To ensure his Administration took action to modernize these permitting and review processes, on March 22, 2012, the President signed Executive Order 13604, Improving Performance of Federal Permitting and Review of Infrastructure Projects and subsequently a Presidential Memorandum on May 17, 2013, charging an interagency Steering Committee to lead the development of a plan to turn best practices into standard practice.  This Implementation Plan identifies four strategies, 15 reforms, and nearly 100 both near-term and long-term milestones.  The strategies are:</p>
<ul><li>Strategy 1: Institutionalize Interagency Coordination and Transparency, by formalizing interagency coordination policies, including early identification of a lead agency; synchronizing Federal review and permitting processes and decisions; standardizing the use of the Infrastructure Permitting Dashboard; and identifying best practices for early engagement with State, Local and Tribal governments.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Strategy 2:  Improve Project Planning, Siting, and Application Quality by developing tools to assist project applicants in planning for a major infrastructure project and support effective and timely decision-making by agency staff once the Federal processes begins. </li>
</ul><ul><li>Strategy 3: Improve Permitting Reviews and Mitigation by supporting agency staff in effectively implementing existing regulations, policies, and guidance as well as identifying barriers. This strategy also includes policies to facilitate advance planning for the mitigation of project impacts and landscape- or watershed-level approaches to mitigation, where appropriate.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Strategy 4: Drive Continued Improvement.  Fully implementing these actions and achieving the President’s goal will require a team dedicated to implementing the reforms on an interagency basis, further analyze agency processes, and identify additional reforms.  This strategy includes a proposal to establish a dedicated interagency team to support the ongoing improvement of Federal permitting and review responsibilities for major infrastructure projects.  In addition, this strategy includes a proposal to develop reliable metrics to track timeframes and outcomes for communities and the environment.</li>

Advances in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) have long been central to our Nation’s ability to manufacture better and smarter products, improve health care, develop cleaner and more efficient domestic energy sources, preserve the environment, safeguard national security, and grow the economy. For the United States to maintain its preeminent position in the world it will be essential that the Nation continues to lead in STEM, but evidence indicates that current educational pathways are not leading to a sufficiently large and well-trained STEM workforce to achieve this goal, nor is the U.S. education system cultivating a culture of STEM education necessary for a STEM-literate public. Thus it is essential that the United States enhance U.S. students’ engagement in STEM disciplines and inspire and equip many more students to excel in STEM fields.</p>
<p>A number of Federal agencies place a high priority on STEM education and have developed education initiatives unique to their agency’s mission, needs, and resources.  To better leverage Federal assets, expertise, and partnerships toward a goal of national importance, a cross agency priority to improve STEM education has been developed to increase agency coordination and use of evidence-based approaches to improve P-12 STEM instruction, increase and sustain youth and public engagement in STEM, enhance the STEM experience of undergraduate students, better serve groups historically underrepresented in STEM fields, design graduate education for tomorrow’s STEM workforce, build new models for leveraging assets and expertise, and build and use evidence-based approaches. </p>

</div>  </div>  
  <div class="views-field views-field-field-cag-overview-revision-id">    <span class="views-label views-label-field-cag-overview-revision-id">Overview: </span>    <div class="field-content"><p>The American people deserve a Government that is responsive to their needs. Citizens and businesses expect government services to be well-designed, efficient, and generally comparable to the services they receive from leading private sector organizations. Whether they call the IRS for an answer to a tax question or visit a Social Security Administration office to adjust their benefits, they should experience high-quality interactions with the Federal Government. Despite some important strides to improve customer service over the past fifteen years, too often many Federal Government services fail to meet the expectations of citizens and business, creating unnecessary hassle and cost for citizens, businesses, and the government itself.  The Federal Government must keep pace with the public’s expectations and transform its customer services – soliciting regular customer feedback, streamlining processes, and delivering consistent quality service across customer channels.</p>
<p>To that end, in April 2011 the President issued an<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/27/executive-order-streamlining-service-delivery-and-improving-customer-ser" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/27/executive-order-streamlining-service-delivery-and-improving-customer-ser">Executive Order</a> requiring each agency to develop a customer service plan that identified implementation steps for their customer service activities, including a "signature initiative" that uses technology to improve the customer experience. Agencies posted the plans on their Open Government websites in October 2011, and this goal will build on these plans to streamline and improve customer service delivery.</p>
<p>To build upon the progress being made by individual agencies, the Administration is taking action to deliver improved customer service across the Federal enterprise.  The Administration will:</p>
<ul><li><em>Streamline transactions.</em>  Too often the processes and procedures of government have been developed piecemeal over time, and have not been regularly reexamined to ensure they are designed with the user experience in mind.  The Administration will identify transactions with a high impact on a significant number of citizens and streamline processes, better meet customer needs, and use performance measures to improve services.  This includes areas such as TSA security screening, veterans’ pension and disability applications, income-based repayment of student loans, Social Security, and taxpayer assistance.</li>
<li><em>Develop standards for high impact services.</em>  Citizen expectations for government services are continually increasing, driven by improvements in technology and the high quality services provided by the private sector.  Government leaders have a responsibility to understand customer expectations and service needs, and continually evaluate and improve their effectiveness in meeting those needs.  To facilitate this, many government programs that provide direct services to the public can benefit from setting customer service standards, clearly communicating these standards to customers, and ensuring these standards are being met.  The Administration will identify best practices in setting customer service standards, such as placing an emphasis on first contact resolution, and facilitate implementation of these practices for high impact services.</li>
<li><em>Utilize technology to improve the customer experience.</em>  The Administration will work to deliver world-class customer services to citizens by making it faster and easier for individuals and businesses to complete transactions with government online.  Given the continually growing importance of online services, the Administration has established a separate Cross-Agency Priority Goal to focus resources and attention on this priority area. </li>

The Administration will work with agencies to utilize existing authorities to attract top talent and consult with Agencies, the Office of Personnel Management, and Congressional stakeholders to expand the use of flexible hiring authorities. The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will also work with Agencies to incubate and scale new approaches to the design, development and delivery of top digital services and transactions.</li>
<li>Get the best companies working with government. The Administration’s efforts in this area will focus on streamlining the Federal IT acquisition process. Specific initiatives include creating more visibility of contracting opportunities for small, innovative companies; maximizing the use of available contracting flexibilities and best practices; and recommending administrative changes to the IT procurement processes.</li>
<li>Put the right processes and practices in place to drive outcomes and accountability. OMB will create and apply a new oversight and management process to highest impact IT investments in the Federal government. This process will include the best IT development and management approaches employed by the public and private sectors.  Lessons learned from this oversight process will be used to expand best practices across all agency IT investments.</li>

Today, proposals for contracts are lengthy, overly prescriptive, and laden with Government-specific requirements. There is also staggering duplication of contracts across Government and very little information sharing between agencies on pricing or other important contractual information. In order to fundamentally improve how taxpayer dollars are used in the Federal contracting space, the Administration is embarking on a comprehensive initiative to enhance collaboration and cooperation and drive greater innovation and improved performance through the implementation of Category Management.</p>
<p>This cross-agency priority (CAP) goal is focused on category management and will build on the progress made in the strategic sourcing initiative, leveraging the consolidated purchasing power of the Government to buy smarter and reduce duplication.  Category management is a new, more strategic approach that will enable the federal government to buy smarter and more like a single enterprise.  It involves identifying core areas of spend, developing heightened levels of expertise, leveraging shared best practices, providing streamlined solutions for acquisition, and managing supply and demand.  The objective is to increase efficiency and effectiveness while reducing costs and redundancies.  The first area of focus for category management is information technology and the CAP goal will support this initiative.  The objectives of the Category Management CAP goal will be expanded as the Category Management Leadership Council endorses other areas of focus.  The CAP Goal metrics can be found on the “supporting materials tabs” and progress updates will begin in the final Quarter of FY15.  </p>

If we are focused, committed, systematic, and intentional, we can make the sort of transformative changes in our service delivery approach that have altered the course of the commercial retail marketplace and reinvigorated American manufacturing. </p>
<p>We need to commit to driving efficiencies by creating opportunities to leverage existing resources and pool the government’s buying power.  This involves building common standards for underlying support activities and systems and driving out redundancy in administrative service provision.  It means changing agency expectations and incentives for spending.  And it means rethinking the way that the government considers and funds long-term investments in the systems and infrastructure that support customer service delivery. </p>
<p>The Federal Government will leverage the Executive Councils to develop common standards and benchmarks to measure shared service utilization, performance, and cost. Mandate those standards and benchmarks for common administrative services. From these standards and benchmarks we will drive efficiencies and greater performance by: 1) increasing the capacity of the Federal Shared Service Providers (SSPs) at DOI, USDA, Treasury, HHS, DOT and DOD; and 2) requiring use of lower-cost, higher-performing Shared Services for all agencies and SSPs which cannot meet established targets. We will target the following areas for Shared Services (listed in order of priority): financial, HR, technology, and acquisition.</p>

<p>The Administration will sustain and intensify these efforts in the second term by:</p>
<ul><li>Establishing cost and quality benchmarks for core/administrative operations, such as HR, Finance, Acquisition, and IT.  We will leverage the agency executive councils to develop common standards and benchmarks to measure shared service utilization, performance, and cost.  We will then use those standards and benchmarks for common administrative services as the baseline for driving continuous improvements in performance.</li>
<li>Cutting improper payments.

<p>The Administration has made significant progress in improving the management of information resources to increase interoperability and openness. In executive order 13642 President Obama outlined a clear vision for “Making Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information” wherever possible and legally permissible. The subsequently released Open Data Policy (OMB memorandum M-13-13) directed agencies to effectively “manage the information as a strategic asset” throughout its lifecycle and make data open by default to the extent permitted by law, while ensuring strict controls to safeguard individual privacy, confidentiality, and national security. </p>
<p>As a direct result, Americans are getting better access to government information and services they need. Homeowners who are struggling to pay their mortgages now get prompt, clear responses because companies are competing based on open consumer financial product complaint data published by CFPB, and can stay in their homes. Similarly, patients can now comparison shop to see which hospitals have the best outcomes and best prices thanks to data published by Medicaid and HHS—including a new dataset that for the first time shows what hospitals charge for inpatient services associated with the 100 most common kinds of hospital stays, revealing huge variations in hospital charges across the country and even within metro areas.</p>
<p>To drive further impact and results, the Open Data CAP Goal will focus on a series of government-wide objectives, strategies and major metrics that facilitate and gauge the outcome-oriented and management improvement goals of Open Data.  Metrics will prioritize three channels of impact measurement: impact on economic value creation organizations, impact on existing public program outcomes, and impact on internal government efficiency.  </p>

To ensure a first-class Federal workforce long-term, we will invest in our civil service leadership by taking administrative actions that result in a broader experience and skill base across the Federal Executive Corps.  This includes addressing the “pain points” in the hiring process and enhancing training and accountability over the terms of their service.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul><li>Enable Agencies to Hire the Best Talent from All Segments of Society.  We will collaborate with Federal stakeholders and labor groups to ensure a balanced strategic approach to improving hiring outcomes. In the short term, we will identify and address the erosion of the original flexibilities of Title 5.  In the long term, we will work closely with labor unions and use demonstration projects and/or legislation and regulatory changes to ensure that our hiring processes attract and retain America’s talent.  We will measure the success of this effort by assessing manager satisfaction with the quality of both applicants and their hires after six months on the job. </li>

                                        <h2>Strategic Goals & Objectives</h2>
                    <p>Agencies establish a variety of organizational goals to drive progress toward key outcomes for the American people. Long-term strategic goals articulate clear statements of what the agency wants to achieve to advance its mission and address relevant national problems, needs, challenges and opportunities. Strategic objectives define the outcome or management impact the agency is trying to achieve, and also include the agency's role. Each strategic objective is tracked through a suite of performance goals, indicators and other evidence.
                                                    <p>The President, as Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, is the senior military authority in the nation ultimately responsible for the protection of the U.S. from all enemies, foreign and domestic. We report to our Commander-in-Chief and execute the directions of the administration elected to serve the nation. The U.S. Congress is our Board of Directors as part of the Constitution’s system of checks and balances. We further have responsibility to our armed forces who risk their well-being for the nation. The American people are our citizen stockholders we exist  to  protect.  In  developing  the DoD Agency Strategic Plan,  periodic  consultations  have  included<br />
solicitation and consideration of views and suggestions with our interested stakeholders.<br />

<p>By September 30, 2017, DoD will improve the career readiness of Service members transitioning to civilian life by: 1) ensuring at least 85% of eligible active duty Service members and 85% of eligible reserve component Service members complete the following required transition activities prior to separation from active duty: pre-separation counseling, a Department of Labor employment workshop, and Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits briefings; 2) verifying that at least 85% of eligible active duty Service members and 85% of eligible reserve component Service members meet established Career Readiness Standards or received a warm handover to appropriate partner agencies prior to separation from active duty; 3) accelerating the transition of recovering Service Members into Veteran status by reducing the disability evaluation processing time; and 4) supporting the seamless transition of recovering Service Members by sharing active recovery plans with the VA.</p>
</p>
                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p><strong>Problem / Opportunity:</strong></p>
<p>DoD and other critical federal partners are working to ensure that all eligible Service members participate in an effective program of pre-separation planning and education through evidence-based learning.  This support is delivered through a new curriculum, Transition GPS (Goals, Plans, Success) within the DoD Transition Assistance Program (TAP).</p>
<p>There are no current Government Accountability Office (GAO) or Inspector General (IG) audits related to Performance Measures 1 and 2.  On June 24, 2015, the DoD IG requested that TVPO provide follow-up on comments made in GAO Report-14-144, Transitioning Veterans: Improved Oversight Needed to Enhance Implementation of Transition Assistance Program (GAO Code 131231).  In response to this IG request, the following response was provided: The Interagency TAP Evaluation Strategy was created and subsequently approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in May 2014.  A written plan describing this strategy was completed in April 2015.  </p>
<p>There are no current Government Accountability Office (GAO) or IG audits related to Performance Measure 3 (IDES) or Performance Measure 4 (WII Active Recovery Plans).</p>
<p><strong>Relationship to Strategic Goal and Objective:</strong><br />
This performance  goal supports the Department's mission through the following strategies:<br />
1. DoD Agency Strategic Plan (ASP), Goal #3: Strengthen and Enhance the Health and Effectiveness of the Total Workforce; Strategic Objective 3.1 Service members separating from Active Duty are prepared for the transition to civilian life.<br />
2. Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) Strategic Goal 4: Preserve and Enhance the All-Volunteer Force; Strategic Goal 5: Provide an Agile, Efficient, Comprehensive Enterprise that Responds to the Warfighter and Maintains Public Confidence Strategic Objective 4.1: Provide top-quality physical and psychological care to wounded warriors while reducing growth in overall healthcare costs; Objective 5.6: Provide more effective and efficient Force Readiness Operations Support.<br />
 </p>
<p><strong>Key Barriers and Challenges:</strong></p>
<p>Securing Transition Assistance Program (TAP) resources for both the DoD and interagency partners to meet statutory and DoD policy requirements. Achieving full accountability of Service members meeting Veterans Opportunity to Work (VOW) and Congressional Research Service (CRS) compliance, given the variety of systems and data collection methods that must be integrated to verify completion of mandatory pre-separation activities and training. Mission requirements often take priority over transition activities; full integration across the military life cycle requires a cultural shift for both Service members and commanders.</p>
<p>DoD and Veteran’s Affairs (VA) are joint partners in the Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES), and both Departments’ ability to meet IDES’ goals depends on the other’s performance. The IDES process still relies in part on the exchange of paper case files.  To increase process efficiency and improve program oversight, DoD is developing a comprehensive electronic case management system that will be interoperable with VA systems.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation Efforts:</strong><br />
DoD continues to work to identify and resolve the remaining gaps in data collection and transmission of the VOW and CRS compliance rate data to ensure data accuracy and that the DD Forms 2958 are received for all eligible Service members separating from active duty. In June 2015, OSD P&amp;R Business Council approved a streamlined enterprise data collection process that will mitigate some risks to data quality.</p>
<p>DoD is taking steps to accelerate the transition of Wounded, Ill, and Injured Service Members into Veteran status.  The Department is incorporating feedback from Service members and quality assurance reviews of disability determination in addition to monitoring disability processing of timeliness to streamline the IDES process.  DoD is also collaborating with VA to eliminate duplicate work, and share medical examination and disability ratings to produce faster, more consistent determinations. To this end, DoD established and IDES performance measure, consisting of the timeliness for specific phases, Service member satisfaction, accuracy and consistency of determinations, and compliance with administrative processing requirements. The DoD will actively monitor and track these elements to ensure the performance targets are met.</p>

<p>Executive order 13693 mandates a 2.5% annual reduction in facilities energy intensity as measured in British Thermal Units per gross square foot.  Improving facility energy performance on DoD installations will lower energy costs, improve mission effectiveness, improve energy resilience, and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Energy is a fundamental enabler of military capability.  In the context of operational missions, understanding the implications of energy use in systems and weapons platforms allows DoD to improve combat effectiveness.  Specifically, the Department can assess the energy supportability of systems and concepts through scenario-based analyses that include realistic threats and logistics constraints. </p>
<p>By September 30, 2025, DoD will improve its facility energy performance by reducing average building energy intensity by 25% from the 2015 baseline: 1) By September 30, 2017, the DoD will improve its facility energy performance by reducing average facility energy intensity by 5% from a 2015 baseline.  2)  By September 30, 2018, the DoD will improve its facility energy performance by reducing average facility energy intensity by 7.5% from 2015 baseline. </p>
<p>By September 2018, DoD will institutionalize operational energy considerations in the force development process: 1) By September 30, 2016 DoD will ensure all acquisition programs that use operational energy and are designated as Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) Interest Items by the Joint Staff have an Energy Supportability Analysis (ESA)-informed Energy Key Performance Parameter (eKPP); 2) By September 30, 2017, DoD will include operational energy constraints and limitations analyses in all Title 10 war games; and 3) By September 30, 2018, ensure ESAs are used in all acquisition programs that use operational energy and were established in FY 2016 and later.</p>
</p>
                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p><strong>Problem / Opportunity:</strong><br />
As the single largest consumer of energy in the nation, accounting for around one percent of national demand, DoD spent approximately $4 billion in FY2014 to power its fixed installations and non-tactical vehicle fleet (installation energy).  Operational energy accounts for a substantial portion of DoDs overall consumption – warranting efforts for data accuracy and accountability.</p>
<p><strong>Relationship to Strategic Goal and Objective:</strong><br />
As DoD strives to better support 21st century needs by reforming and reshaping the institution to gain efficiencies and effectiveness, efforts to reduce the nation’s predominant energy consumption and consequential expenditures must remain a Defense priority.</p>
<p>Operational energy is the energy required for training, moving, and sustaining military forces and weapons platforms for military operations.  This includes energy used by tactical power systems and generators, as well as by weapons platforms themselves.  The DoD considers operational energy to be the energy used in military operations, in direct support of military operations, and in training that supports unit readiness for military operations, to include the energy used at non-enduring locations (contingency bases).</p>
<p>Improving the energy supportability of DoD systems and weapons platforms directly supports the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review statement that “Energy improvements enhance range, endurance, and agility, particularly in the future security environment where logistics may be constrained.”  Facility energy improvements support DoD’s Strategic Goal to Reform and Reshape the Defense Institution and Strategic Objective to Achieve efficiencies and effectiveness to redirect resources to direct support of combat, combat support, and combat service support elements of the DoD. Operational energy efforts directly support DoD’s Strategic Goal to Defeat our Adversaries, Deter War, and Defend the Nation.</p>
<p><strong>Key Barriers and Challenges:</strong><br />
Improving facility energy performance depends upon capital investments in energy efficiency programs.  Major reductions in the facility energy budget as a result of sequestration during FY 2013 and FY 2014 will make it very difficult for the Department to meet mandated facility energy goals.</p>
<p>To improve decision making related to operational energy, DoD needs reliable and detailed data on energy consumption.  Current methods for measuring operational energy consumption typically do not include information on end use, limiting DoD’s ability to inform planning, programming, and operational decisions. </p>
<p>Successfully institutionalizing energy supportability analyses in DoD force development is dependent on widespread adoption and understanding of the value of Energy Supportability Analyses (ESAs) as well as the consistent application of realistic threats and limited logistics capacity in our force development planning. Improved capabilities (e.g., increased range, improved force protection, etc.) are often inseparable from increased energy demand.  Addressing that increased energy demand through adaptations in the Department’s use of energy often come at the expense of significant funding gaps, as modifications, upgrades, or other design changes are expensive to implement.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation Efforts: </strong><br />
The DoD will continue to pursue opportunities to use third-party financing through performance based energy savings contracts.  DoD has a commitment to execute nearly $2.1 billion in third-party financed performance-based contracts (Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPC) and Utility Energy Service Contracts (UESC)) by the end of CY2016, in response to the President’s December. 2, 2011 commitment.  To date, DoD has awarded $1.05 billion in performance based energy contracts.</p>
<p>Additionally, improved estimate efforts on end use consumption of operational energy will better inform DoD with a credible baseline.</p>

<p>Next to supporting the armed forces at war, this is the highest priority for DoD’s acquisition professionals.  There is a continuing responsibility to procure the critical goods and services the U.S. armed forces need in the years ahead without having ever-increasing budgets to pay for them.  It has taken years for excessive costs and unproductive overhead to creep into DoD’s business practices.  The Better Buying Power Initiatives roadmap for addressing these problems includes targeting affordability, controlling cost growth, controlling cycle times, and promoting real competition.</p>

<p>This Priority Goal contributes to DoD achieving the Strategic Goal to Achieve Dominant Capabilities through Innovation and Technical Excellence and the Strategic Objective to improve acquisition process from requirement definition to execution phase and through lifecycle enhancement, to acquire and sustain military-unique and commercial items by including over 80 Major Defense Acquisition Programs and policies that enable over $250 billion in annual obligations by the Department of Defense.  The scope alone covers a significant portion of DoD’s business.     </p>
<p><strong>Congressional Input (Relevant Highlights):</strong></p>
<p>These initiatives support statutory compliance and give the taxpayer the greatest return for their money.  The initiatives also provide accurate and timely decision-making information.</p>
<p><strong>Key Barriers and Challenges:</strong></p>
<p>Budget uncertainty is the greatest risk that can impact reaching our performance goals and measures.  Stability and the ability to plan with reasonable budget projections are paramount.  All of the improvements in performance of the acquisition system can easily be undone with the inefficiencies and vagaries of budgetary uncertainty and volatility. Yet, there is a continuing responsibility to procure the critical goods and services the U.S. armed forces need in the years ahead without having ever-increasing budgets to pay for them.  The key internal challenge for DoD is to put each program on a sound footing from the beginning.  The Acquisition workforce must understand and employ a variety of Better Buying Power tools to ensure solid programmatics at program inception and throughout execution.  Through 2016, Quarterly Business Senior Integration Group (B-SIG) meetings continued with senior leader focus and attention on competition achievement to increase visibility and accountability.  At these meetings, the Service Acquisition Executives attributed difficulties with achieving Service goals for competition rates to high value sole source foreign military sales and “Bridge” contracts that impacted competition achievement.  Additionally, contracts for major non-competitive shipbuilding and aviation programs driven by historical strategic decisions made years ago continue to influence competition opportunities for the long term.  These factors contributed significantly to the Department’s FY 2016 competition rate of 52.8 (last year’s report said 55.1) percent. </p>
<p><strong>Mitigation Efforts:</strong></p>
<p>DoD can guard against cost growth by ensuring a match between requirements and resources when the program baseline is established at program initiation or Milestone B.  In other words, acquisition programs begin with mature technologies, adequate funding and personnel resources, and sufficient time to finish product development. </p>
<p>Also, requirements must be achievable given those resource constraints and must be agreed upon and remain largely intact throughout the product development phase. DoD must guard against so-called “requirements creep.” Furthermore, disciplined and constant oversight is needed. The Services and program managers (PMs) also need to overcome any shortcomings in staff capabilities to perform the kind of portfolio analyses and systems engineering tradeoff analyses that would strengthen DoD’s ability to understand and control future costs from a program’s inception. </p>
<p>Regarding competition, it is the single most powerful tool for reducing costs, and the most common reason for DoD noncompetitive awards is that one contractor is the only responsible source for the procurement.  This occurs because the program has moved past the stage in the lifecycle where competition is economically viable.  The Department continues to take steps to increase competition for major systems by introducing competition during the sustainment phase of a product's life cycle through the use of open systems and open architectures.</p>
<p>USD(AT&amp;L) is undertaking additional analysis of FY 2014-2015 competition rates.  For FY 2016, the Director of Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy (DPAP), with Component input, will examine differing circumstances and projected competitive opportunities to enable more meaningful and achievable goals.</p>
<p>To prevent cost breaches and cycle time growth for newer MDAP programs, DoD has strengthened the front end of the acquisition process through new policy and procedural guidance.  Release of the request for proposal for the Engineering and Management Development (EMD) Phase is the critical decision point in a program. The program will either successfully lead to a fielded capability or encounter problems based on the soundness of the capability requirements, the affordability of the program, and the feasibility of the program execution plan put into motion at that point. To increase emphasis on the importance of this decision, the USD(AT&amp;L) has issued policy guidance establishing a new decision point, the Pre-EMD review, designed to ensure a comprehensive and effective discussion of program business arrangements and readiness to proceed to EMD before EMD source selection and Milestone B.</p>

                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p><strong>1) Problem / Opportunity:</strong></p>
<p>Sexual assault is a significant challenge facing the United States military and the nation. It is a detriment to the welfare of men and women in uniform and is antithetic to core military values of trust, dignity, and respect. Although the military has made great strides in sexual assault prevention and response in recent years, sexual assault remains a problem in the Department. According to the 2014 RAND Military Workplace Survey, about four percent of military women and one percent of military men experience a sexual assault in a given year. Based on these prevalence rates, an estimated 18,900 Service members experienced unwanted sexual contact in 2014, down from the 26,000 Service member victims estimated in 2012. However, less than a quarter of them report the allegation to a military authority. The Department’s approach promotes a military climate that empowers all to do their part to prevent sexual assault, and encourages Service members to report the allegations. Increased reporting signals growing trust of command and confidence in the response system. Increased reporting also serves as the primary means by which the Department can provide restorative care and hold offenders appropriately accountable through the military justice system, which in turn contributes to improved force readiness.</p>
<p class="rtejustify">As outlined in the 2014 Report to the President of the United States on Sexual Assault Prevention and Response in the Military Active Bystander, “Intervention” is a, “philosophy and strategy for prevention of various types of violence, including bullying, sexual harassment, sexual assault, and intimate partner violence. The approach is based on evidence that people make decisions and continue behaviors based on the cultural conditioning and norms through subtle reactions from others and the resultant expectations of social interaction.” Bystander intervention is unique in that it:</p>
<ul><li class="rtejustify">Discourages victim blaming</li>
<li class="rtejustify">Offers the chance to change social norms</li>
<li class="rtejustify">Shifts responsibility to all Service members</li>
</ul><p class="rtejustify">Measuring interventions and reporting rates annually provides an indication of positive cultural change that can be sampled on a re-occurring basis. The Department employs multiple data collection efforts at varying timeframes. The Workplace and Gender Relations surveys for Active Duty and Reserve Component personnel are fielded every two years on off-years from each other.  Other surveys and focus groups also occur inside and outside of that timeframe.  </p>
<p class="rtejustify"><strong>Government Accountability Office (GAO) audit related to Performance Measure #3</strong>:<br /><strong>GAO-15-284, Military Personnel – Actions Needed to Address Sexual Assaults of Male Service Members.</strong><br /><strong>Issue(s):</strong></p>
<ul><li class="rtejustify">DoD needs to improve its ability to prevent and respond to sexual assaults of male Service members. DoD has not used all of the available data on male victims, such as analyses that show significantly fewer male Service members than females reporting sexual assault, to inform program decision making. </li>
<li class="rtejustify">DOD has not generally portrayed male sexual assault in its sexual assault prevention training material.</li>
</ul><p class="rtejustify"><strong>Recommendations: </strong></p>
<ul><li class="rtejustify">Develop a plan for data-driven decision-making to prioritize program efforts.</li>
<li class="rtejustify">Revise sexual assault prevention and response training to more comprehensively and directly address the incidence of sexual assault allegations by male service members and how certain behavior and activities – like hazing–can lead to a sexual assault.</li>
</ul><p class="rtejustify"><strong>DoD Actions:</strong> The Department has taken steps this past year to build a foundation of data sources to shape policy and programs and to advance the appropriate prevention and response systems that meet the needs of both men and women. DoD’s research and data collection efforts have broadened our understanding of the differences in how both men and women experience the crime of sexual assault in the military. Since 2006, our biennial Workplace and Gender Relations Survey of the force has provided invaluable data on the extent of sexual assault in the military. As part of the 2014 Military Workplace Study, DoD enlisted the support of the RAND Corporation to take a closer look at gender differences in sexual assault patterns. As a result of that study, it appears that the experience of an assault may be interpreted differently. While viewed as an assault by some, other victims might see an act as a form of “hazing.” These differences in how a victim interprets the crime often fall along gender lines. Some men may not even consider the act to be something sexual, but rather abusive and humiliating. In addition, results reveal that men are more likely to report experiencing sexual assault in their place of duty; whereas women are more likely to report experiencing sexual assault outside of the workplace. The Department is incorporating key findings about gender differences into the advocate certification program and training for Service Members, as well as enhancing the male-focused information and resources on the DoD Safe Helpline. Our prevention focus leverages commanders to regularly assess their environments and take corrective action, as appropriate, with sexual assault and hazing being specific targets for intervention. Additionally, these findings motivated the Secretary of Defense to direct that the Department fully evaluate its gender-focused treatment capabilities and provider training to ensure they address the specific needs of women and men.</p>
<p class="rtejustify"><strong>2) Relationship to Strategic Goal and Objective:</strong></p>
<p class="rtejustify">This performance goal supports the Department's mission through the following strategies:</p>
<ul><li class="rtejustify">DoD Agency Strategic Plan (ASP), Goal #2: Strengthen and Enhance the Health and Effectiveness of the Total Workforce; Strategic Objective 2.2: Support and retain the DOD workforce by fostering and encouraging workforce initiatives to ensure employees are trained, engaged and retained.</li>
<li class="rtejustify">Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) 2014, Strategic Goal: Maintain the strength of the all-volunteer force and implement new reforms.  </li>
<li class="rtejustify">DoD Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Strategy, Strategic Objective 1: Deliver consistent and effective prevention methods and programs, Strategic Objective 4: Deliver consistent and effective victim support, response, and reporting options.</li>
</ul><p class="rtejustify"><strong>3) Congressional Inputs:</strong><br />
The Department works closely with Congress to improve its programs and policies and to eliminate sexual assault from the military. National Defense Authorization Acts for fiscal years 2012 through 2016 include over 75 sections of law and contain more than 100 requirements related to sexual assault in the military, many of which were built on or in parallel with existing Secretary of Defense initiatives. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 alone provided the most sweeping changes to military law since 1968. Additionally, the Congressionally mandated Response System to Adult Sexual Crimes Panel provided over 130 recommendations to the department to improve sexual assault prevention and response in the military. In December 2015, the Department submitted the first comprehensive military justice reform package in more than 30 years to Congress, which includes 37 statutory additions and substantive amendments to 68 current provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Combined, these provisions seek to improve the military justice system’s capability to appropriately and effectively handle sexual assault and sexual harassment cases.</p>
<p class="rtejustify"><strong>4) Key Barriers and Challenges:</strong><br />
Although the military faces some of the same challenges with preventing and responding to sexual assault as civilian society, there are some unique barriers and challenges:</p>
<ul><li class="rtejustify">Individuals within the DoD come from a wide variety of backgrounds and their past experiences shape their attitudes and behavior, which may be inconsistent with serving in the military. This, coupled with the significant turnover of personnel each year, is a challenge to maintaining force readiness and eliminating sexual assault from the military.</li>
<li class="rtejustify">There is a perceived stigma associated with reporting sexual assault allegations in an environment that idealizes confidence, decisiveness, and strength. Thus, military members are particularly impacted by this stigma, as many are concerned about being mislabeled as weak or experiencing inappropriate scrutiny of their sexual orientation. This is of particular concern with men. The military is roughly 85% male and we estimate that more men experience sexual assault each year than women. However, men report the crime at a much lower rate. Approximately 10% of men estimated to have experienced a sexual assault make a restricted (confidential) or unrestricted report, and approximately 40% of women estimated to have experienced a sexual assault make a restricted or unrestricted report to DoD. We must overcome the stigma and myths that suggest that only weak people are victims of crime. </li>
<li class="rtejustify">Research indicates many civilian and military sexual assault victims fear being blamed for the crime. Victim blaming is often predicated on the false belief that a victim’s behavior somehow caused the offender to perpetrate the crime. We must overcome the stigma surrounding victim blaming within the military environment.</li>
<li class="rtejustify">Maintaining confidentiality in the military environment is difficult, even with the protections afforded certain communications in both policy and law.    </li>
<li class="rtejustify">Fear of negative career impact is also a factor in many victims’ decisions not to report a sexual assault allegation. </li>
</ul><p class="rtejustify"><strong>5) Mitigation Efforts:</strong><br />
DoD has an existing leadership structure, empowered by law to promote good order and discipline. In seeking ways to eliminate sexual assault, the Department is leveraging its existing culture of honor, dignity, and respect to drive organizational changes that empower every Service Member to take action against disrespectful and dangerous behaviors.<br />
The Department will continue to deliberately solicit victim feedback and engage subject matter experts to inform SAPR policies and programs.</p>

<p><strong>Congressional Highlights:</strong></p>
<p>As addressed in the NDAA (starting with 2010), directed requirements related to:</p>
<ul><li>The development of a plan that includes interim objectives and a schedule of milestones for each military department and for the defense agencies, supporting audit readiness goals, to include improvements and business systems modernization efforts necessary for the DoD to consistently prepare timely, reliable, and complete financial management information.</li>

<li>DoD Financial Management Regulation</li>
<li>Financial Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) Handbook of Accounting Standards and other pronouncements</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong>Key Barriers and Challenges:</strong></p>
<p>The size, diverse functional scope of business operations and frequently non-standard, decentralized execution of support operations makes this an extremely challenging endeavor.</p>
<p><u><em>Valuation of Assets:</em></u>  Valuation of General Property, Plant, and Equipment and of Inventory and Related Property is critical. Many of the Department’s assets were acquired decades ago and before there was a requirement to produce financial statements. As a result, the acquisition (cost) documents required for supporting valuation and audit are often no longer available. The Department must use alternative valuation methods.</p>
<p><em><u>Fund Balance with Treasury</u></em>:  Due to the size of the Department’s budget and the enormous amount of funds expended and collected, the number of accounting transactions that must be reconciled between the Department’s accounts and Treasury is very large and complex, compounded by nonstandard data, weak system controls, and edits at the end of the process instead at the beginning.</p>
<p><em><u>Universe of Transactions:</u></em>  Providing complete universes of transactions is especially challenging for the Components because of the numerous accounting systems used to initiate and record transactions as well as hundreds of feeder systems where most transactions originate. Components must verify that open obligations for all active and expired appropriations (beginning balances) are supported before starting SBR and full financial statement audits.</p>
<p><u><em>IT Systems:</em></u> The Department has nearly 500 individual IT systems relevant to audit. Meeting the needs of the auditors requires too many manual workarounds and stretches limited resources even more thinly. These systems are costly to maintain and result in substantial IT control issues. To efficiently audit the Department, auditors must be able to rely on the IT environment. The more systems DoD uses, the more difficult the task becomes.</p>
<p><u><em>Environmental Liabilities:</em></u> The Department has not been able to provide assurance that clean-up costs for all of its ongoing, closed, and disposal operations are identified, consistently estimated, and appropriately reported. Additionally, the Department is not able to consistently report environmental liability disclosures and supporting documentation is not properly maintained and readily available for all environmental sites.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation Efforts:</strong></p>
<p>A strategy has been implemented that includes close engagement with standards setters and audit community such as the DoD Office of the IG, the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB), and independent public accounting firms to define cost efficient solutions for audit “show stoppers.” In addition, the Department has collaborated with Independent Public Accountants and the FASAB to issue policies governing Existence, Completeness, and Rights. Further, the Department has established working groups to address critical capabilities needed for audit and is in the process of developing detailed implementation plans. The Department will continue to assess risks against these critical capabilities and adjust corrective actions accordingly.</p>
<p class="rteindent1"><u>Critical Capabilities Include:</u></p>
<p class="rteindent2">• Critical systems internal controls that impact financial statements<br />
• Fund Balance with Treasury Reconciliation<br />
• Complete Universe of Accounting Transactions<br />
• Property Existence, Completeness, Rights and Valuation<br />
• Environmental Liabilities<br />
• Unsupported Journal Vouchers</p>
<p>The OUSD(C) is partnering with the DoD CIO, DCMO, and DFAS to establish a comprehensive Department-wide solution for risks related to the identified critical capabilities to ensure the Department’s financial statements are complete, accurate, and fully supported by financial transactions.</p>

                               <p><span class="acc_content_label">Statement:</span><p>With America's involvement in Afghanistan winding down, there is a large influx of returning Service members and veterans transitioning to civilian life. To better support all Service members, DoD transformed its Wounded Warrior Agency Priority Goal from Fiscal Years 2012-2013 to an Agency Priority Goal (APG) focused on Transition to Veterans.  Transition to Veterans is a top DoD priority, and the Department wants to ensure our men and women in uniform are fully equipped for life after their military Service.</p>
<p>To that end, the Department has identified four programmatic goals that best reflect transition to veterans.  These goals include: By September 30, 2015 DoD  will improve the career readiness of Service Members’ transitioning to Veteran status by:  1)  ensuring at least 85% of eligible Service Members complete required transition activities prior to separation: pre-separation counseling, a Department of Labor (DoL) employment workshop, and Veterans Affairs’ benefits briefings; 2) verifying that at least 85% of separating service members meet  newly established Career Readiness Standards prior to separation; 3)  accelerating the transition of recovering Service Members into Veteran status by reducing disability evaluation processing time; and 4)  supporting the seamless transition of recovering Service Members by sharing active recovery plans with the VA.</p>
</p>
                               <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>Our Nation should provide the best support possible to those who keep our country free and strong as they transition to civilian life, especially during this time of planned structural reorganizations within the Department of Defense (DoD).   To this end, the DoD is partnering with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the Department of Labor, the Small Business Administration and the Department of Education, to ensure that all Service members participate in an effective program of pre-separation planning and education through evidence-based learning.  This support is delivered through a new curriculum, Transition GPS (Goals, Plans, Success), within the Department’s Transition Assistance Program (TAP).</p>
<p>The Department is also taking steps to accelerate the transition of Wounded, Ill, and Injured Service Members into Veteran status by reducing disability evaluation processing time   The Department is incorporating feedback from Service members and quality assurance reviews of disability determinations in addition to monitoring disability processing timeliness to better streamline the Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES) process.  DoD is also collaborating with VA to eliminate duplicate work, and share medical examination and disability ratings to produce faster, more consistent determinations. To this end, the Department established an overall performance measure consisting of timeliness for specific phases within the IDES, Service member satisfaction with the IDES, and quality objectives measuring the accuracy and consistency of IDES disability determinations.  The Department will actively monitor and track performance against these measures to ensure DoD performance goals are met.</p>
<p><strong>Key barriers and </strong><strong>challenges:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Securing TAP resources for both the DoD and interagency partners to meet statutory and DoD policy requirements.</li>
<li>Consolidating multiple Federal and private-sector websites into a single portal that offers resume building, military to civilian skills translation, and connections between Service members and employers.</li>
<li>Achieving full accountability for delivery of Transition GPS, given the variety of systems and data collection methods that must be integrated to verify completion of mandatory pre-separation activities and training.</li>
<li>Mission requirements often take priority over transition activities; full integration across the military lifecycle requires a cultural shift for both Service Members and Commanders.</li>
<li>DoD and VA are joint partners in the IDES, and both Departments' ability to meet IDES’ goals depends on the other's performance.</li>
<li>The IDES process still relies on paper case files; an electronic case management system is under development.</li>
<li>Delays in the proposed rating and benefits decision process increase IDES process cycle time.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives</strong></p>
<p>This goal supports the Department’s mission through Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) 2010 Goal #4: Preserve and Enhance the All-Volunteer Force. There are also four supporting performance measures:</p>
<ul><li>Require Service Members to attend pre-separation workshops and counseling sessions prior to separation:
<ul><li>Separation VOW Compliance (Active Duty) (5.6.1-2T5)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Create a Career Readiness Standard for Service Members prior to separation:
<ul><li>Separation Career Readiness Standards (Active Duty) (5.6.2-2T5)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Accelerate the transition of Wounded, Ill and Injured Service Members into Veteran status by reducing the disability evaluation processing time:
<ul><li>Percent of Wounded, Ill, or Injured Service Members who meet DoD IDES core process cycle time and satisfaction goals (4.1.3-2M)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Increase the use of Recovery Care Coordinators and ensure recovering Service Members have active recovery plans:
<ul><li>Percentage of recovering Service Members enrolled in Wounded Warrior Programs with Active Recovery Plans that are shared with the VA to aid in successful transition (4.1.4-2M)</li>
</ul></li>

<p>Executive Order 13693 mandates a 2.5% annual reduction in facilities’ energy intensity as measured in British Thermal Units per gross square foot.  Improving DoD facility energy performance on installations will lower energy costs, improve mission effectiveness, improve energy security, and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Energy is a fundamental enabler of military capability.  In the context of operational missions, understanding the implications of energy use in systems and weapons platforms enables DoD to improve combat effectiveness.  Specifically, the Department can assess the energy supportability of systems and concepts through scenario-based analyses that include realistic threats and logistics constraints. </p>
<p>By September 30, 2025, DoD will improve its facility energy performance by reducing average building energy intensity by 25% from the 2015 baseline: 1) By September 30, 2017, DoD will improve its facility energy performance by reducing average facility energy intensity by 5% from a 2015 baseline.</p>
<p>By September 2018, DoD will institutionalize operational energy considerations in the force development process: 1) By September 30, 2016 DoD will ensure all acquisition programs that use operational energy and designated as Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) Interest Items by the Joint Staff have an Energy Supportability Analysis(ESA)-informed Energy Key Performance Parameter (eKPP); 2) By September 30, 2017, DoD will include operational energy constraints and limitations analyses in all Title 10 war games; and 3) By September 30, 2018, DoD will ensure ESAs are used in all acquisition programs that use operational energy and were established in FY16 and later.</p>
</p>
                               <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>Improving facility energy performance at Department of Defense (DoD) installations will reduce reliance on fossil fuels, lower energy costs, improve mission effectiveness, and improve energy security. Efficiencies will be achieved by reducing the demand for   traditional energy while increasing the supply of renewable energy. Legislation mandates a 3 percent annual reduction in facilities energy intensity as measured in British Thermal Units per gross square foot (BTU/GSF). Additionally, the Department has a requirement to increase production or procurement of renewable energy equal to 25 percent of its electrical energy usage by fiscal year (FY) 2025.</p>
<p>Reliable and detailed data on energy consumption are essential to improving decision making within the Department. Recently, the Department has improved the measurement of operational energy consumption and is improving the use of this information in the requirements, acquisition, and resourcing processes throughout the Department.</p>
<p>The DoD is the single largest consumer of energy in the nation, accounting for   approximately one percent of national demand. For FY2014, the Department has budgeted approximately $20 billion on energy, with 80 percent going to support military operations (“operational energy”) and the remaining 20 percent to power its fixed installations (“facility energy”).</p>
<p><em>Operational Energy</em></p>
<p>Operational Energy is the use of energy to train, move, and sustain military forces and weapons platforms for military operations. Overseen by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations and Environment (ASD (EI&amp;E), “operational energy” powers generators at our contingency bases as well  as aircraft, ships, and tactical vehicles in operational and training activities around the globe.</p>
<p>Petroleum is currently the fuel of choice for military operations because of its high energy density, fungibility, and global availability. As a result, a steady and reliable supply of petroleum is essential to every military capability and mission. However, the Department’s ability to reliably deliver petroleum to deployed forces is challenged by a variety of geographic, geopolitical, and military challenges.</p>
<p>The Department’s first ever Operational Energy Strategy was released in 2011. This strategy outlines three principal ways to achieve energy security for the Department: reducing the demand for energy, expanding and securing the supply of energy, and building energy security into the future force.</p>
<p><em>Facility Energy</em></p>
<p>The second broad use of energy is to support the more than 500 fixed installations we operate in the United States and overseas. Overseen by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations and Environment, “facility energy” consists largely of traditional energy sources used to heat, cool, and provide electrical power to these buildings. It also includes the fuel used by the 200,000 non-tactical vehicles housed at our installations. The DoD has pursued a facility energy investment strategy designed to reduce the energy costs and improve the energy security of our bases.</p>
<p>Despite falling short of the FY 2014 intensity reduction goal of 27 percent, the DoD reduced its energy intensity by 17.6 percent from the FY 2003 baseline and improved by 0.4% from FY 2013. While DoD continues to invest in cost-effective energy efficiency and conservation measures to improve goal progress, there will be challenges in future reductions. These challenges will include: (1)  budget sequestration and delayed appropriations, which lead to a reduction in   energy efficiency and conservation projects, (2)  uncontrollable variables such as weather and temperature variability (i.e., heating and cooling degree days ), increasing facility energy use, and (3)  a greater reliance on  conducting missions at fixed installations and enduring locations (e.g., training, unmanned aircraft, intelligence, surveillance or  reconnaissance missions) , leading to an increased reliance on  energy from fixed installations and enduring locations. However, DoD saw significant gains in renewable energy performance in FY2014. DoD increased the amount of renewable energy it produced or procured from 11.8% in FY2013 to 12.3% in FY2014.</p>

<p>In the Better Buying Power (BBP) initiative announced in September 2010, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD(AT&amp;L)) directed the acquisition professionals in DoD to deliver better value to the taxpayer and warfighter by improving the way DoD  does business. Next to supporting the Armed Forces at war, he stated that this was the President’s and Secretary of Defense’s highest priority for DoD’s acquisition professionals. USD(AT&amp;L) pointed out their continuing responsibility to procure the critical goods and services U.S. Armed Forces need in the years ahead without having ever-increasing budgets to pay for them. It has taken years for excessive costs and unproductive overhead to creep into DoD’s business practices. The roadmap for addressing these problems includes targeting affordability, controlling cost growth, and promoting real competition. The USD(AT&amp;L) re-emphasized the management philosophy of continued improvement when he introduced Better Buying Power 2.0 in November 2012. This announcement encompassed 36 initiatives organized into seven focus areas, and included a new focus area that reflected the importance of the total acquisition workforce. The basic goal of BBP; however, remains unchanged: deliver better value to the taxpayer and Warfighter by improving the way the Department does business.</p>
<p>The key challenge for DoD is to put its acquisition programs on sound footing from their beginning. DoD can guard against cost growth by ensuring a match between requirements and resources when the APB is established at program initiation or Milestone B. In other words, acquisition programs begin with mature technologies, adequate funding and personnel resources, and sufficient time to finish product development. Also, requirements must be achievable given those resource constraints and must be agreed upon and remain largely intact throughout the product development phase. DoD must guard against so-called “requirements creep.” Furthermore, disciplined and constant oversight is needed. The Services and program managers (PMs) also need to overcome any shortcomings in staff capabilities to perform the kind of portfolio analyses and systems engineering tradeoff analyses that would strengthen DoD’s ability to understand and control future costs from a program’s inception. Regarding competition, the most common reason for DoD noncompetitive awards is that one contractor is the only responsible source for  the procurement. The challenge for DoD is to support and strengthen the supplier base to give the Government more supply options. The second most common reason is “authorized by statute.” For example, awards under the Small Business Administration’s 8(a) business development program.</p>

<p> </p>
</p>
                               <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><div>
<p>The National Defense Authorization Act of 2010 mandates that the Department of Defense (DoD) have audit ready financial statements by 2017. Audit ready means the Department has strengthened its internal controls and improved its financial practices, processes, and systems so there is reasonable confidence the information can withstand an audit by an independent auditor.</p>
<p>DoD’s four principle financial statements include:</p>
<p><u><strong>Statement of Budgetary Resources</strong></u> - Provides information about how budgetary resources were made available as well as their status at the end of the period. It is the only financial statement exclusively derived from the Department’s budgetary general ledger.</p>
<p><u><strong>Balance Sheet </strong></u>- Reflects the Department’s financial position as of the statement date. The assets are the amount of future economic benefits owned or managed by the Department. The liabilities are amounts owed by the Department. The net position is the difference between the assets and liabilities.</p>
<p><u><strong>Statement of Net Cost</strong></u> - Separately reports the components of the net cost of the Department’s operations for the period. Net cost is equal to the gross cost incurred by the Department less any exchange revenue earned from its activities, further adjusted for net gains and losses.</p>
<p><u><strong>Statement of Changes in Net Position</strong></u> - Presents the total cumulative results of operations since inception and unexpended appropriations at the end of the fiscal year. The statement focuses on how the net cost of operations is financed. The resulting financial position represents the difference between assets and liabilities as shown on the consolidated balance sheet. This statement is supported by achieving an audit ready Balance Sheet and Statement of Net Cost.</p>
</div>
<p>APG challenges include:</p>
<ul><li>Valuation of Assets: Valuation of General Property, Plant, and Equipment and of Inventory and Related Property is critical. Many of the Department’s assets were acquired decades ago and before there was a requirement to produce financial statements. As a result, the acquisition (cost) documents required for supporting valuation and audit are often no longer available. For these assets, the Department must use alternative valuation methods.</li>
<li>Fund Balance with Treasury: Due to the size of the Department’s budget and the enormous amount of funds expended and collected, the number of accounting transactions that must be reconciled between the Department’s accounts and Treasury is very large and the task complex.</li>
<li>Statement of Budgetary Resources:
<ul><li>Universe of Transactions- Providing complete universes of transactions is especially challenging for the Components because of the numerous accounting systems used to initiate and record transactions as well as hundreds of feeder systems where most transactions originate.</li>
<li>Beginning Balances-Components must verify that open obligations for all active and expired appropriations are supported before beginning Statement of Budgetary Resources (SBR) audits, and many hundreds of open and expired appropriations must be reviewed.</li>
</ul></li>

<ol><li>Evaluation and return to duty, separation, or retirement for Service members due to medical disability.</li>
<li>Access to and participation in an effective program of pre-separation planning and education through evidence-based learning.</li>
</ol><p> </p>
<p>To meet these challenges, the Department of Defense (DoD) partners with  agencies across the federal government to  medical evaluation support is delivered through the Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES), while planning and education support comes through the Transition Goals, Plans, Success (GPS) curriculum within the DoD's Transition Assistance Program (TAP).</p>
