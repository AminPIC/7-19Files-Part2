<div class="intro_text">
<p>Established by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goals are a tool used to accelerate progress on a limited number of priority areas where implementation requires active collaboration between multiple agencies, overcoming organizational barriers to achieve better performance than one agency can achieve on its own.</p>
<p>Set or revised at least every four years, CAP Goals include outcome-oriented goals that cover a limited number of crosscutting policy areas as well as management goals focused on management improvements across the Federal Government in areas of financial management, strategic human capital management, information technology management, procurement and acquisition management, and real property management.</p>
<p>A series of 16 CAP Goals were announced in the 2015 Budget with clearly named accountable officials, data-driven reviews that incorporated a broad range of quantitative and qualitative inputs, and reporting to the public through a common website as a framework to drive performance improvements on cross-government collaboration and tackle government-wide management challenges affecting most agencies.</p>

<p>On June 30, 2016, the President signed into law the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 – nearly 50 years after President Johnson signed the original FOIA into law.  This critical legislation reflects the progress made by the Administration, codifies a number of openness and transparency principles, and ensures that the Administration’s track record of openness is institutionalized throughout government and carries forward for years to come.  Concurrent with the signing of the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, the White House released a Fact Sheet committing the Administration to:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Utilizing the Chief FOIA Officers Council and FOIA Advisory Committee to address FOIA’s greatest challenges;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promoting broader release of records through a “release to one is a release to all” presumption;</p>

</div>  </div>  
  <div class="views-field views-field-field-cag-overview-revision-id">    <span class="views-label views-label-field-cag-overview-revision-id">Overview: </span>    <div class="field-content"><p>On March 19, 2015, the President issued Executive Order 13693, <em>Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade</em>, which set forth ambitious climate, energy, and environmental sustainability goals for Federal agencies over the next decade.  Executive departments and agencies have been among our Nation’s leaders as the United States works to build a clean energy economy that will sustain our prosperity and the health of our people and our environment for generations to come. Federal leadership in energy, environmental water, transportation fleets, buildings, and acquisition management will continue to drive national greenhouse gas reductions and support preparations for the impacts of climate change. The Federal Government has the opportunity to significantly reduce direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2025, while at the same time fostering innovation, reducing spending, and strengthening the communities in which our Federal facilities operate. </p>
<p>Employing this strategy for the next decade calls for expanded and updated Federal environmental performance goals with a clear overarching objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions across Federal operations and the Federal supply chain.  Goals for greenhouse gas emissions reduction (40% by 2025), renewable electricity (30% by 2025), clean energy (25% by 2025), and performance contracting ($4 billion in awarded contracts by Dec. 2016) are already well established in the Federal community. The enhanced target for each of these goals will require agencies to sharpen their focus on achieving the goals through existing mechanisms and new technologies that enhance efficiency and use of clean energy.</p>
<p>CEQ and OMB have worked closely to ensure that Federal agencies understand the necessary steps to pursuing the new environmental sustainability goals and those efforts are supported by an interagency Steering Committee.  Pursuit of these sustainability goals will involve at least 25 of the largest Federal agencies. Success will be greatly enhanced by the cross-cutting nature of the goals and the similarity in the tools and procedures used for implementation.</p>
<p>While all Federal agencies have an important role to play in ensuring the Government meets its energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets, key delivery agencies include: The General Services Administration, Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Energy, National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Department of Homeland Security.</p>

In the wake of increasing threats and incidents, the President directed a series of reviews to examine current security, suitability/fitness, and credentialing processes and to recommend areas in need of reform. The interagency reviews identified problem areas and made specific recommendations, which were approved by the Performance Accountability Council (PAC). The PAC developed the Strategic Intent to build upon these efforts and create a lasting impact by providing overarching strategic direction to personnel security, suitability/fitness, and credentialing reform efforts for the next five years.  </p>
<p>The Strategic Intent represents our framework for sustaining progress mandated by the February 2014 Suitability and Security Processes Review Report to the President, the January 2016 PAC Review of Background Investigations, relevant legislation, and other key drivers. It builds on progress since the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 and the subsequent, significant reform efforts that resulted in greater standardization and alignment of suitability and security processes. Through this framework, the PAC will work with other members of the Executive Branch to drive continuous process improvement to personnel security, suitability/fitness, and credentialing programs and address evolving threats. While we cannot eliminate risk altogether, it is imperative that we work across disciplines to maximize our collective efforts to mitigate the risks we face, while ensuring appropriate protections for privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. We must ensure measures to improve these programs avoid imposing unreasonable burdens on the Federal workforce that could negatively impact operations. Therefore, the Federal Government will pursue a balanced approach by addressing the risks posed by personnel who could do significant harm by virtue of the nature of their position.</p>
<p>These reforms will further support ongoing Insider Threat Program implementation by providing earlier detection and improving the quality of vetting. The improved attention to cybersecurity will reinforce efforts to protect sensitive mission data, including personally-identifiable information. </p>

According to AT Kearney’s Foreign Direct Investment Confidence Index, confidence in the U.S. as a location for FDI is high, ranking as the top destination for investment ahead of China, Brazil, Canada, and India.<sup>1 </sup>The U.S. remains the world’s largest economy and is also the largest recipient of foreign direct investment in the world. Over the last ten years, U.S. affiliates of foreign companies have employed more than five million workers, the majority of which are high-paying manufacturing jobs. On average, jobs created by FDI in United States pay up to 30% more.<sup>2</sup>  However, due to global capital mobility and increased foreign competition, we need to take steps to maintain and grow our share of global investment.</p>
<p>Historically, we have left our states and cities to compete for investments with a country’s investment promotion agency, limiting our opportunities to clearly demonstrate our commitment to attracting investment and to leverage our advantages as a top destination for investment. In 2011, through Executive Order, the U.S. launched SelectUSA, the first Federal effort to promote and facilitate inbound business investment. The E.O. created the Interagency Investment Working Group (IIWG) to further design and implement the first-ever coordinated U.S. investment promotion authority. As a driver for success, the global investment team, consisting of both SelectUSA headquarters in DC and investment teams at posts led by Ambassadors, will increase the number of active investment cases touched to encourage business investments.</p>
<p>At the first SelectUSA Investment Summit in Oct 31-Nov. 1 2013, the President reformed SelectUSA, creating a number of firsts: for the first time there will be a clear system for advocacy for high-priority, job-creating investments, driven by the most senior Administration officials all the way up to the President; for the first time there will be a single point of contact for ready investors looking to bring jobs and production to the U.S.; lastly, the Administration is engaging in unprecedented coordinated support for states and localities to attract investment.</p>
<p>Key contributing agencies to the Job-Creating Investment CAP goal include the Department of Commerce, Small Business Administration, US Department of Agriculture, Department of State, Department of Homeland Security, and Export-Import Bank of the U.S.</p>

  <div class="views-field views-field-field-cag-overview-revision-id">    <span class="views-label views-label-field-cag-overview-revision-id">Overview: </span>    <div class="field-content"><p>Building a 21st century infrastructure in a manner that safeguards our communities and the environment is an important component of President Obama’s effort to strengthen our Nation’s economy, create new jobs, and improve U.S. competitiveness in the global market.  Federal agencies seek to ensure that as these major infrastructure projects are proposed, potential impacts on safety, security, and environmental and community resources such as air, water, land, and historical and cultural resources are considered and minimized. Over time, the process and legal requirements for the permitting and review of major infrastructure projects have developed in a siloed and ad-hoc way, creating complex processes that in some cases have taken years or longer to complete.  Although there are several reasons why a major infrastructure project may be delayed (including applicant funding uncertainty and state and local reviews), over the past three years the Administration has undertaken an ambitious effort to modernize the Federal government’s role in permitting and review processes.</p>
<p>To ensure his Administration took action to modernize these permitting and review processes, on March 22, 2012, the President signed Executive Order 13604, Improving Performance of Federal Permitting and Review of Infrastructure Projects and subsequently a Presidential Memorandum on May 17, 2013, charging an interagency Steering Committee to lead the development of a plan to turn best practices into standard practice.  This Implementation Plan identifies four strategies, 15 reforms, and nearly 100 both near-term and long-term milestones.  The strategies are:</p>
<ul><li>Strategy 1: Institutionalize Interagency Coordination and Transparency, by formalizing interagency coordination policies, including early identification of a lead agency; synchronizing Federal review and permitting processes and decisions; standardizing the use of the Infrastructure Permitting Dashboard; and identifying best practices for early engagement with State, Local and Tribal governments.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Strategy 2:  Improve Project Planning, Siting, and Application Quality by developing tools to assist project applicants in planning for a major infrastructure project and support effective and timely decision-making by agency staff once the Federal processes begins. </li>
</ul><ul><li>Strategy 3: Improve Permitting Reviews and Mitigation by supporting agency staff in effectively implementing existing regulations, policies, and guidance as well as identifying barriers. This strategy also includes policies to facilitate advance planning for the mitigation of project impacts and landscape- or watershed-level approaches to mitigation, where appropriate.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Strategy 4: Drive Continued Improvement.  Fully implementing these actions and achieving the President’s goal will require a team dedicated to implementing the reforms on an interagency basis, further analyze agency processes, and identify additional reforms.  This strategy includes a proposal to establish a dedicated interagency team to support the ongoing improvement of Federal permitting and review responsibilities for major infrastructure projects.  In addition, this strategy includes a proposal to develop reliable metrics to track timeframes and outcomes for communities and the environment.</li>

Advances in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) have long been central to our Nation’s ability to manufacture better and smarter products, improve health care, develop cleaner and more efficient domestic energy sources, preserve the environment, safeguard national security, and grow the economy. For the United States to maintain its preeminent position in the world it will be essential that the Nation continues to lead in STEM, but evidence indicates that current educational pathways are not leading to a sufficiently large and well-trained STEM workforce to achieve this goal, nor is the U.S. education system cultivating a culture of STEM education necessary for a STEM-literate public. Thus it is essential that the United States enhance U.S. students’ engagement in STEM disciplines and inspire and equip many more students to excel in STEM fields.</p>
<p>A number of Federal agencies place a high priority on STEM education and have developed education initiatives unique to their agency’s mission, needs, and resources.  To better leverage Federal assets, expertise, and partnerships toward a goal of national importance, a cross agency priority to improve STEM education has been developed to increase agency coordination and use of evidence-based approaches to improve P-12 STEM instruction, increase and sustain youth and public engagement in STEM, enhance the STEM experience of undergraduate students, better serve groups historically underrepresented in STEM fields, design graduate education for tomorrow’s STEM workforce, build new models for leveraging assets and expertise, and build and use evidence-based approaches. </p>

</div>  </div>  
  <div class="views-field views-field-field-cag-overview-revision-id">    <span class="views-label views-label-field-cag-overview-revision-id">Overview: </span>    <div class="field-content"><p>The American people deserve a Government that is responsive to their needs. Citizens and businesses expect government services to be well-designed, efficient, and generally comparable to the services they receive from leading private sector organizations. Whether they call the IRS for an answer to a tax question or visit a Social Security Administration office to adjust their benefits, they should experience high-quality interactions with the Federal Government. Despite some important strides to improve customer service over the past fifteen years, too often many Federal Government services fail to meet the expectations of citizens and business, creating unnecessary hassle and cost for citizens, businesses, and the government itself.  The Federal Government must keep pace with the public’s expectations and transform its customer services – soliciting regular customer feedback, streamlining processes, and delivering consistent quality service across customer channels.</p>
<p>To that end, in April 2011 the President issued an<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/27/executive-order-streamlining-service-delivery-and-improving-customer-ser" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/27/executive-order-streamlining-service-delivery-and-improving-customer-ser">Executive Order</a> requiring each agency to develop a customer service plan that identified implementation steps for their customer service activities, including a "signature initiative" that uses technology to improve the customer experience. Agencies posted the plans on their Open Government websites in October 2011, and this goal will build on these plans to streamline and improve customer service delivery.</p>
<p>To build upon the progress being made by individual agencies, the Administration is taking action to deliver improved customer service across the Federal enterprise.  The Administration will:</p>
<ul><li><em>Streamline transactions.</em>  Too often the processes and procedures of government have been developed piecemeal over time, and have not been regularly reexamined to ensure they are designed with the user experience in mind.  The Administration will identify transactions with a high impact on a significant number of citizens and streamline processes, better meet customer needs, and use performance measures to improve services.  This includes areas such as TSA security screening, veterans’ pension and disability applications, income-based repayment of student loans, Social Security, and taxpayer assistance.</li>
<li><em>Develop standards for high impact services.</em>  Citizen expectations for government services are continually increasing, driven by improvements in technology and the high quality services provided by the private sector.  Government leaders have a responsibility to understand customer expectations and service needs, and continually evaluate and improve their effectiveness in meeting those needs.  To facilitate this, many government programs that provide direct services to the public can benefit from setting customer service standards, clearly communicating these standards to customers, and ensuring these standards are being met.  The Administration will identify best practices in setting customer service standards, such as placing an emphasis on first contact resolution, and facilitate implementation of these practices for high impact services.</li>
<li><em>Utilize technology to improve the customer experience.</em>  The Administration will work to deliver world-class customer services to citizens by making it faster and easier for individuals and businesses to complete transactions with government online.  Given the continually growing importance of online services, the Administration has established a separate Cross-Agency Priority Goal to focus resources and attention on this priority area. </li>

The Administration will work with agencies to utilize existing authorities to attract top talent and consult with Agencies, the Office of Personnel Management, and Congressional stakeholders to expand the use of flexible hiring authorities. The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will also work with Agencies to incubate and scale new approaches to the design, development and delivery of top digital services and transactions.</li>
<li>Get the best companies working with government. The Administration’s efforts in this area will focus on streamlining the Federal IT acquisition process. Specific initiatives include creating more visibility of contracting opportunities for small, innovative companies; maximizing the use of available contracting flexibilities and best practices; and recommending administrative changes to the IT procurement processes.</li>
<li>Put the right processes and practices in place to drive outcomes and accountability. OMB will create and apply a new oversight and management process to highest impact IT investments in the Federal government. This process will include the best IT development and management approaches employed by the public and private sectors.  Lessons learned from this oversight process will be used to expand best practices across all agency IT investments.</li>

Today, proposals for contracts are lengthy, overly prescriptive, and laden with Government-specific requirements. There is also staggering duplication of contracts across Government and very little information sharing between agencies on pricing or other important contractual information. In order to fundamentally improve how taxpayer dollars are used in the Federal contracting space, the Administration is embarking on a comprehensive initiative to enhance collaboration and cooperation and drive greater innovation and improved performance through the implementation of Category Management.</p>
<p>This cross-agency priority (CAP) goal is focused on category management and will build on the progress made in the strategic sourcing initiative, leveraging the consolidated purchasing power of the Government to buy smarter and reduce duplication.  Category management is a new, more strategic approach that will enable the federal government to buy smarter and more like a single enterprise.  It involves identifying core areas of spend, developing heightened levels of expertise, leveraging shared best practices, providing streamlined solutions for acquisition, and managing supply and demand.  The objective is to increase efficiency and effectiveness while reducing costs and redundancies.  The first area of focus for category management is information technology and the CAP goal will support this initiative.  The objectives of the Category Management CAP goal will be expanded as the Category Management Leadership Council endorses other areas of focus.  The CAP Goal metrics can be found on the “supporting materials tabs” and progress updates will begin in the final Quarter of FY15.  </p>

If we are focused, committed, systematic, and intentional, we can make the sort of transformative changes in our service delivery approach that have altered the course of the commercial retail marketplace and reinvigorated American manufacturing. </p>
<p>We need to commit to driving efficiencies by creating opportunities to leverage existing resources and pool the government’s buying power.  This involves building common standards for underlying support activities and systems and driving out redundancy in administrative service provision.  It means changing agency expectations and incentives for spending.  And it means rethinking the way that the government considers and funds long-term investments in the systems and infrastructure that support customer service delivery. </p>
<p>The Federal Government will leverage the Executive Councils to develop common standards and benchmarks to measure shared service utilization, performance, and cost. Mandate those standards and benchmarks for common administrative services. From these standards and benchmarks we will drive efficiencies and greater performance by: 1) increasing the capacity of the Federal Shared Service Providers (SSPs) at DOI, USDA, Treasury, HHS, DOT and DOD; and 2) requiring use of lower-cost, higher-performing Shared Services for all agencies and SSPs which cannot meet established targets. We will target the following areas for Shared Services (listed in order of priority): financial, HR, technology, and acquisition.</p>

<p>The Administration has made significant progress in improving the management of information resources to increase interoperability and openness. In executive order 13642 President Obama outlined a clear vision for “Making Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information” wherever possible and legally permissible. The subsequently released Open Data Policy (OMB memorandum M-13-13) directed agencies to effectively “manage the information as a strategic asset” throughout its lifecycle and make data open by default to the extent permitted by law, while ensuring strict controls to safeguard individual privacy, confidentiality, and national security. </p>
<p>As a direct result, Americans are getting better access to government information and services they need. Homeowners who are struggling to pay their mortgages now get prompt, clear responses because companies are competing based on open consumer financial product complaint data published by CFPB, and can stay in their homes. Similarly, patients can now comparison shop to see which hospitals have the best outcomes and best prices thanks to data published by Medicaid and HHS—including a new dataset that for the first time shows what hospitals charge for inpatient services associated with the 100 most common kinds of hospital stays, revealing huge variations in hospital charges across the country and even within metro areas.</p>
<p>To drive further impact and results, the Open Data CAP Goal will focus on a series of government-wide objectives, strategies and major metrics that facilitate and gauge the outcome-oriented and management improvement goals of Open Data.  Metrics will prioritize three channels of impact measurement: impact on economic value creation organizations, impact on existing public program outcomes, and impact on internal government efficiency.  </p>

<ul><li>Create a Culture of Excellence and Engagement to Enable Higher Performance.  We will foster a culture of excellence by using data-driven approaches to enhance management, performance, and innovation across the current Federal workforce.  Specifically, we will focus on employee engagement (measured by employee views about their leaders, supervisors, and work experience), as multiple evaluations have demonstrated a strong correlation between employee engagement and an organization’s productivity.  Agencies can now get access to this data for over 13,000 work-level units across the country (up from just a few hundred units four years ago).  This level of specificity in data will provide agency managers with actionable information to target areas where improvement is needed most and where there are management best practices that can provide a model for success.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul><li>Build a World-Class Federal Management Team Starting with the Senior Executive Service (SES). To ensure a first-class Federal workforce long-term, we will invest in our civil service leadership by taking administrative actions that result in a broader experience and skill base across the Federal Executive Corps.  This includes addressing the “pain points” in the hiring process and enhancing training and accountability over the terms of their service.</li>

<ul><li>Enable Agencies to Hire the Best Talent from All Segments of Society.  We will collaborate with Federal stakeholders and labor groups to ensure a balanced strategic approach to improving hiring outcomes. In the short term, we will identify and address the erosion of the original flexibilities of Title 5.  In the long term, we will work closely with labor unions and use demonstration projects and/or legislation and regulatory changes to ensure that our hiring processes attract and retain America’s talent.  We will measure the success of this effort by assessing manager satisfaction with the quality of both applicants and their hires after six months on the job. </li>

                            <div class='thingtoshoworhide' style='display: none'><p>GSA engaged key stakeholders in the development of this plan. These stakeholders include customers, suppliers, executive councils, and the Office of Management and Budget. Both federal and non-federal stakeholders were consulted when developing and formulating goals. Through activities like the Top to Bottom Review, the Great Ideas Hunt, and numerous town hall meetings, people at every level of GSA provided input about how we can be more efficient and effective. We conducted strategic visioning sessions, which included external stakeholders to define the future state of the agency, and published our draft Strategic Plan on our website and requested comments from stakeholders: including Congressional stakeholders and the American public. All comments received were considered when finalizing this plan and updating our internal processes for planning and performance management.</p>

Federal agencies purchase over $500B of goods and services annually. A key vehicle used by GSA, and other top purchasing federal government agencies, to promote cost savings, improved management visibility and adoption of best practices, has been the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative. Established in 2005, FSSI is designed to improve government management of commonly purchased goods and services. FSSI provides customers with significant savings, decreases administrative redundancy, and improves business intelligence while meeting or exceeding small business and sustainability goals.</p>

We are a government-wide leader and expert in real estate solutions. We will assist and educate federal departments and agencies to develop plans that will assist agencies with consolidating their space to reduce their footprint.</p>
<p>GSA is encouraging agencies to reduce space to minimize costs. We use a variety of tools, strategies, and portfolio planning options to determine the optimal housing solutions for agencies. We are also targeting our large, more costly new construction, major repairs and alterations, and leasing prospectus projects. By working with customer agencies, GSA will identify opportunities to optimize federal real estate portfolios by reducing space, improving utilization, disposing of underutilized assets, and leveraging market opportunities to reduce the footprint and investment and operating costs.</p>
<p>GSA supports the Office of Management and Budget’s “Freeze the Footprint” policy – aimed at maintaining government-wide square footage for offices and warehouses – by collecting government-wide data and conducting analysis to assess the performance of each agency towards meeting the national goal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Strategies:</strong></p>
<ol><li>Use of the Customer Portfolio Plans process to develop and implement space saving opportunities with demonstrated value for both the client and GSA. These plans create value by proposing solutions which align Administration, Client Agency and GSA goals, and help optimize an agency’s existing portfolio while more effectively anticipating, capturing, and advising on future portfolio needs.</li>
<li>Where it is advantageous to the federal government, work to house tenants in federally owned space, rather than leasing from the private sector.</li>
<li>Minimize the amount of vacant space in the inventory and increase the utilization of existing space.</li>
</ol><p> </p>

Federal agencies purchase over $500B of goods and services annually. A key vehicle used by GSA, and other top purchasing federal government agencies, to promote cost savings, improved management visibility and adoption of best practices, has been the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative. Established in 2005, FSSI is designed to improve government management of commonly purchased goods and services. FSSI provides customers with significant savings, decreases administrative redundancy, and improves business intelligence while meeting or exceeding small business and sustainability goals.</p>

</p>                                          
                                                                                    <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>GSA achieved mixed results in meeting its financial performance goals for improving organizational efficiency. GSA achieved a total of $190 million savings in indirect costs from the FY 2010 baseline, far exceeding its goal of $155 million. However, GSA did not meets its target to improve operational efficiency to reduce GSA operating costs to 9.4 percent of revenue from goods and services provided.  The primary reason for not meeting the target is due to the lower than expected revenue from goods and services provided.  GSA  savings are being realized through consolidation and realignment of key support functions and organizations, and by reviewing, improving and standardizing internal processes and controls.  Three efficiency initiatives of note include data center consolidation, the print management program, and consolidation of GSA’s information technology, human resources, administrative, and financial functions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>·         GSA is consolidating its data centers to increase efficiency through economies of scale.  GSA recently eliminated and/or re-purposed 12,000 square feet of floor space, decommissioned over 230 servers, and moved over 200 servers to other data centers.  By the end of FY2015, GSA projects a net five years savings of $24 million.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>·         GSA also reduced its inventory of printers to increase resource efficiency from 5 to 25 employees per printer. GSA has also developed seven Print-Wise tips to guide employees to make cost-cutting print decisions.  Wide spread adoption of Print-Wise behaviors by other agencies, such as double-sided printing, can save the government hundreds of millions of dollars annually.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>·         GSA determined from a top-to-bottom review that the best way to build a stronger GSA would be to consolidate the IT, HR, administrative, and financial functions of GSA.  By consolidating each of these administrative functions, GSA will improve efficiency with greater clarity around responsibility and accountability.  In the past year, GSA has completed consolidation of each of the four functions.  Each functional organization is going through realignment to ensure the most efficient use of resources to fully meet their area of responsibility.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>GSA has significantly improved the on-time activation of occupancy agreements (OAs) in owned space to 98 percent and leased space to 90 percent.  This is a substantial improvement from the on-time activation rates of  86 percent for owned space and 75 percent for leased space.  At the same time, GSA is having considerable success supporting agencies in their efforts to consolidate their footprints and implement more cost effective workplace solutions.  In part as a result of these consolidation actions, which in some cases lead to vacant leased space that GSA is obligated to continue to pay for, GSA faces challenges achieving full cost recovery in the leasing program.</p>
<p>GSA exceeded its cycle time goals for real property disposal services.  GSA continued to effectively award public sales properties within 135 days. GSA also exceeded its performance target for non-competitive sales and donations within 220 days. GSA continues to efficiently provide training courses through the Federal Acquisition Institute with course attendance levels consistently exceeding 80 percent.</p>

</p>
                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>The mission of the U.S. General Service Administration’s Public Buildings Service (PBS) is to provide effective, mobile, sustainable workplace solutions for federal agencies at the best value and service for the American people. PBS is one of the largest and most diversified public real estate organizations in the world. At the end of FY15, its portfolio consisted of 374.1 million rentable square feet (RSF) in 8,792 active assets across the United States, in all 50 states, 6 U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>GSA is using the Lease Cost Relative to Market (LCRM) measure to demonstrate value for the American taxpayer.  Under the LCRM methodology, the net present value (NPV) of the life-cycle costs of GSA leases in the fiscal year signed for office space in major markets will be compared to the NPV of a market lease.  The market lease rate is based on GSA’s Bullseye report, which combines respected nationwide commercial real estate sources.  This metric covers all off-airport office leases that are located in markets covered by these national real estate market information sources.</p>
<p>This metric covers 42 percent of GSA’s current lease inventory which accounts for 70 percent of the total annual lease rent and 63 percent of total square feet. GSA will count the number of transactions at or below market, with the goal of having at least 55 percent of transactions at or below market.</p>
<p>GSA compares its deals to market costs in order to ensure it is getting the best deal possible for the American taxpayers. While the final comparison to market for this measure is based on post-award rates, a preliminary comparison to market is also run prior to lease award, allowing GSA to continue negotiations if rates are not competitive. By negotiating a majority of lease transaction below market rates, GSA is providing cost savings to our customer agencies and the American taxpayer.  By focusing on the number of transactions that are below market, GSA is demonstrating its commitment to negotiate the best deal possible in every lease transaction.</p>

<p>Whether it’s buying office supplies, electric vehicles, or complex information technology solutions, FAS gets them at a discounted price and delivers the savings back to our customer agencies. FAS  has developed defined methodologies for quantifying savings for the myriad of products and services offered to customer agencies.  The methodologies can generally be grouped into the following categories:</p>
<p>• Savings realized by utilizing FAS procurement vehicles compared to what is available commercially</p>
<p>• Savings realized by using FAS offerings compared to other government offerings</p>
<p>• Savings returned to customers via bank refunds given for using FAS purchase, travel, and fleet cards</p>
