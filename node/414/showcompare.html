            <div class="">
                <p>The FY13 baseline number for Disaster Loan Application Return Rate was 24%, so the goal for FY14 is to achieve 29% and 34% in FY15.  Increasing the application return rate will improve the delivery of the Disaster Loan Program. The primary opportunity being addressed is that a higher application return rate should result in a greater number of disaster survivors that will apply for disaster loan assistance and receive much needed Federal disaster assistance. SBA’s plan to increase the application return rate also ensures that SBA's disaster assistance resources for businesses, non-profit organizations, homeowners, and renters can be deployed quickly, effectively and efficiently in order to preserve jobs and help return small businesses to operation.</p>
<p>SBA’s plan to increase the application return rate will indirectly make the Disaster Loan Program more efficient by: 1) saving costs on mailing application packets to 100% of disaster survivors referred to SBA; and 2) freeing up resources dedicated to preparing and mailing application packets that can be utilized in other critical areas of the application screening process that directly impact processing times.</p>

            <!--<div class="teaser collapsed">

            <div class="">
                <p>SBA will actively market the SBA Disaster Loan Program to disaster survivors. We will explore ways of making on-line access to Electronic Loan Application (ELA) and program information readily available to disaster survivors.  Office of Disaster Assistance will upgrade ODA's marketing to increase public knowledge of SBA’s disaster programs, with emphasis on direct links to the ELA application.  We will capitalize on news media to attract interest in the Disaster Loan Program and provide immediate access to disaster survivors.  The overall strategy will be aimed at our internal partners and the external recipients of disaster assistance.</p>
<p>The application return rate is largely impacted by the footprint of individual disasters and the variance in types of disaster (flooding, wind, fire, etc.) and declaration types (Presidential-Iindividual Assistance, Agency, Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) only). SBA will monitor the impact that these contextual indicators have on the overall progress of the priority goal to increase the application return rate.</p>
<p>We will also look at the return rate to see if there is any impact on goal achievement based on location of the disaster, size of the disaster and type of the disaster.</p>
<p>Key Barriers and Challenges:</p>
<ul><li>Disaster survivors’ reluctance to applying for Federal disaster loan assistance, possibly due to the following reasons: unwilling to apply for additional debt; share financial information, pledge collateral to secure loan or general concerns over uncertain recovery of local economy.</li>
<li>Disaster survivors may also be reluctant to apply for disaster loan assistance if other programs with more desirable terms (e.g. grants, forgivable loans, etc.) are available to them.</li>

            <h2>Progress Update</h2>
            <div>
                <p>The process improvements from previous fiscal years (i.e. implementing separate application tracks for home and business loans, use of electronic loan applications) enabled the SBA to successfully achieve a high Application Return Rate in FY 2015.  Also implementing a new process for issuing applications to disaster survivors in Presidential disaster declarations for Individual Assistance (IA), SBA attained a disaster loan application return rate of 98%.  Prior to FY 2014, SBA mailed a disaster loan application to every individual and business that registered with FEMA and referred to SBA for disaster loan assistance.  Now the referrals from FEMA are contacted by telephone via Disaster Assistant Customer Service Center's auto-dialer and offered the options of applying on-line, applying in-person or applying by mail.  Those individuals not contacted receive a letter detailing the various options for applying. </p>
<p>In all fiscal quarters except one from FY 2014 through FY 2015, the SBA increased the disaster loan application return rate, going from 24% at the end of FY 2013 to 98% at the end of FY 2015.  The SBA improved disaster assistance by integrating user-friendly technology and streamlining the loan application process.  For example, the electronic loan application rate increased to 84 percent in FY 2015, more than tripling the rate from FY 2011.  The SBA is continually reviewing and implementing process improvements to enhance program delivery and improve the customer experience.  For example, the electronic loan application (ELA) for disaster assistance loans has simplified the loan application process, speeding delivery of assistance to eligible disaster survivors and improving the integrity of data used in the underwriting process via the Disaster Credit Management System (DCMS). Also, SBA established approximate loan processing time standards based on tiered levels of application volumes (from less than 50,000 applications to more than 500,000 applications) which will help SBA better manage customer expectations based on the level of disaster activity.</p>
<p> SBA’s new process for issuing applications in Presidential-IA declarations helped increase the application return rate and improves customer service by adding multiple touch points with disaster survivors.  SBA's priority goal strategy has also resulted in reduced mailing costs and savings of $145,000.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>The SBA’s Office of Disaster Assistance (ODA) administers the Disaster Loan Program, one of the Agency’s main tools for helping drive economic recovery for local communities following a disaster. This goal emphasizes the importance of efficient delivery and high quality service in lending to small business owners (up to $2 million for physical damages and/or economic injury) and residents (up to $200,000 for real estate damages and $40,000 personal property losses) following a disaster.  These critical dollars provide a foundation for reestablishing and growing local and/or regional economies.  The Disaster Loan Program is the only SBA loan program directly administered by the agency itself; not through a bank or credit union.</p>
<p>ODA will work with the Office of Communication and Public Liaison (OCPL) to develop messaging to the disaster survivors.  We will work with the Office of Field Operations through District and Regional offices to get the message out to disaster survivors.  In partnership with the Office of Entrepreneurial Development, ODA will work with its resource partners, i.e. Small Business Development Centers (SBDC), Women’s Business Centers (WBC) and SCORE, to distribute information about the SBA Disaster Loan Program and encourage disaster survbivors to apply.</p>
<p>External Stakeholder:  The Office of Disaster Assistance will receive an electronic file from FEMA containing of the contact information for disaster victims that may be eligible for SBA disaster loan.</p>

</p>
                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>Providing access to capital has been one of the SBA’s critical strategies in meeting its objective to drive business formation, job growth and economic expansion particularly in underserved markets since the agency was created in 1953. By providing loan guarantees to reduce lenders’ loss exposure, the SBA provides an important credit lifeline to small businesses, especially startup businesses and businesses owned by women, minorities, veterans and other underserved groups who often cannot easily obtain credit in the  conventional market.  In the current economic conditions, SBA loan programs become even more crucial for ensuring that small businesses are not only surviving but also leading the way toward economic recovery and growth, as they have done time-and-time again throughout U.S. history.</p>
<p>SBA will increase small business access to capital by increasing the number of new or returning lenders in the fiscal year for the flagship 7(a) program (including the Community Advantage pilot program). New and returning lenders are a major component of SBA’s lending portfolio and are essential to growth in the quantity of loans approved and small businesses assisted. Each new or returning lender will expand SBA’s footprint and increase small business access to capital. Attaining a high volume of new and returning lenders from one fiscal year to the next will create a consistent pipeline of SBA loans into the hands of small business.</p>
<p>There are barriers and challenges to the SBA in achieving its priority goals:</p>
<ul><li>Economic Trends; micro and macro</li>
<li>Issues within the Finance Industry as a whole</li>
<li>Shrinking workforce in field offices which provide training</li>
<li>Recent cases from the OIG reviewing SBA lenders underwriting criteria have triggered a more cautious approach from some lenders with some loan guaranty types</li>

</p>
                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>Congress has mandated that small businesses receive <strong>23%</strong> of federal government prime contracting dollars, including <strong>5</strong><strong>% </strong>of prime and subcontracts to Small Disadvantage Businesses; <strong>5% </strong>of prime and subcontracts to Women-Owned Small Businesses; <strong>3% </strong>of prime and subcontracts to HUBZone Small Businesses; and <strong>3% </strong>of prime and subcontracts to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses</p>
<p>Meeting and exceeding the federal government’s small business procurement goals continues to be an Administration priority.  Federal contracting with small businesses is a win-win.  Small businesses get the revenue they need to grow their businesses and create jobs, and the federal government gets the opportunity to work with some of America’s most innovative and nimble small businesses, often times with a direct line to the CEO.</p>
<p>In FY 2012, the federal government made real progress toward the 23 percent goal, with 22.25 percent or $89.9 billion in federal contracting dollars going to small businesses compared to 21.65 percent in FY 2011, with significant impact in key areas:</p>
<ul><li>For the first time, more agencies than ever before met or surpassed all of their prime contracting goals.</li>
<li>Also, for the first time, the federal government exceeded the goal for service disabled veterans.</li>
<li>The federal government had the highest percentage of contracts going to Small Disadvantage Businesses to date.</li>
</ul><p>As a result of a government wide focus on increasing small business contracting opportunities, during President Obama’s first term (FY2009 - FY2012) the federal government awarded $376.2 billion in federal contracting dollars to small businesses.  This is a $48.1 billion increase over the four preceding years even as we have seen reduced spending overall.</p>
<p>Also, since President Obama took office, the SBA has supported more than $132.61 billion in Federal government contracting dollars to small disadvantaged businesses. This represents a 36.6 percent increase when compared to the prior Administration. Under the Bush Administration’s first term, $97.10 billion in federal government contracting dollars were awarded to small disadvantaged businesses.</p>
<p>Although we have seen marked success over the last few years, we know more must be done.  Many challenges exist for small businesses seeking to enter the federal procurement marketplace.</p>
<ul><li>The unpredictable and changing budget climate is a challenge for small businesses, and SBA is working hard to create an environment where small businesses can be successful in the federal procurement marketplace.</li>
<li>The instability and ambiguity caused by Continuing Resolutions make it difficult to agency acquisition staff to plan effectively for small business utilization.</li>
<li>Entering the federal supply chain can often be a lengthy and arduous process for many small businesses.</li>
</ul><p>SBA’s GCBD unit must implement effective and efficient strategies to monitor the agencies’ progress to goal, support small businesses interested in working with the government and encourage agencies to improve data quality when reporting their contracting activities.  SBA will increase its efforts to collaborate with and hold federal agencies accountable to achieving their goals.</p>

                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Statement:</span><p>Expand small business access to export financing by increasing the number of lenders providing export financing solutions from 430 to 555 and the number of small business exporters receiving financing through SBA loan programs from 1,346 to 1,480 by FY2015.</p>
</p>
                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>The priority goal is directly tied to the objective of both the National Export Initiative (NEI) and the Export Promotion Cabinet (EPC) to expand SME access to trade financing, which has been identified as a gap issue for smaller exporters.  Increasing access to export financing, combined with trade counseling and training, will contribute to the enhanced ability of current and future U.S. small business exporters to succeed in the global marketplace and supports the cross-agency goal of doubling U.S. exports.</p>
<p> There are barriers and challenges to the SBA in achieving its priority goals:</p>
<ul><li>From a marketing perspective, communicating and disseminating trade financing information to lenders and small business exporters could provide challenging given current, and anticipated, budget constraints on staffing.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Inter-agency collaboration and joint initiatives can be challenging to manage, given the differing regulations and performance metrics of individual agencies, which might reduce the commitment of other agencies to help support this priority.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Unique, and sometimes additional, Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) requirements for core export loans vs. other 7(a) loan products can confuse lenders and may require the creation of “Lender Training Manuals,” more extensive lender training, and Office of Capital Access support in implementing needed SOP revisions.</li>
</ul><ul><li>In terms of operations, a reduced travel budget could greatly restrict the ability of field staff to deliver the necessary training to lenders and businesses that would expand the use of SBA loan programs for exporters, given that SBA's specialized trade finance specialists cover multiple states.</li>
</ul><ul><li>The banking sector could receive another “financial shock,” forcing it to tighten lending requirements to small businesses and/or Basel III capital requirements could limit lending capacity.*</li>
</ul><ul><li> U.S. export growth could slow, reducing demand for trade financing, as a result of slow overseas economic growth and/or a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, making U.S. exports less competitive.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>Trade financing historically has been perceived by many lenders, especially community banks, as being too complex to be incorporated into their suite of financial products. Working with other federal agencies, SBA will help reduce the complexity of USG trade financing and export marketing programs and highlight the growing importance of exports to the U.S. economy, thereby encouraging more lenders to offer comprehensive business solutions to their export customers.  In addition, SBA will leverage its outreach by working with state, federal, and other resource partners in order to promote customized trade financing options to the small business exporting community.</p>

                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>The FY13 baseline number for Disaster Loan Application Return Rate was 24%, so the goal for FY14 is to achieve 29% and 34% in FY15.  Increasing the application return rate will improve the delivery of the Disaster Loan Program. The primary opportunity being addressed is that a higher application return rate should result in a greater number of disaster survivors that will apply for disaster loan assistance and receive much needed Federal disaster assistance. SBA’s plan to increase the application return rate also ensures that SBA's disaster assistance resources for businesses, non-profit organizations, homeowners, and renters can be deployed quickly, effectively and efficiently in order to preserve jobs and help return small businesses to operation.</p>
<p>SBA’s plan to increase the application return rate will indirectly make the Disaster Loan Program more efficient by: 1) saving costs on mailing application packets to 100% of disaster survivors referred to SBA; and 2) freeing up resources dedicated to preparing and mailing application packets that can be utilized in other critical areas of the application screening process that directly impact processing times.</p>

</p>
                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>Providing access to capital has been one of the SBA’s critical strategies in meeting its objective to drive business formation, job growth and economic expansion particularly in underserved markets since the agency was created in 1953. By providing loan guarantees to reduce lenders’ loss exposure, the SBA provides an important credit lifeline to small businesses, especially startup businesses and businesses owned by women, minorities, veterans and other underserved groups who often cannot easily obtain credit in the  conventional market.  In the current economic conditions, SBA loan programs become even more crucial for ensuring that small businesses are not only surviving but also leading the way toward economic recovery and growth, as they have done time-and-time again throughout U.S. history.</p>
<p>SBA will increase small business access to capital by increasing the number of new or returning lenders in the fiscal year for the flagship 7(a) program (including the Community Advantage pilot program). New and returning lenders are a major component of SBA’s lending portfolio and are essential to growth in the quantity of loans approved and small businesses assisted. Each new or returning lender will expand SBA’s footprint and increase small business access to capital. Attaining a high volume of new and returning lenders from one fiscal year to the next will create a consistent pipeline of SBA loans into the hands of small business.</p>
<p>There are barriers and challenges to the SBA in achieving its priority goals:</p>
<ul><li>Economic Trends; micro and macro</li>
<li>Issues within the Finance Industry as a whole</li>
<li>Shrinking workforce in field offices which provide training</li>
<li>Recent cases from the OIG reviewing SBA lenders underwriting criteria have triggered a more cautious approach from some lenders with some loan guaranty types</li>

<p>Meeting and exceeding the federal government’s small business procurement goals continues to be an Administration priority.  Federal contracting with small businesses is a win-win.  Small businesses get the revenue they need to grow their businesses and create jobs, and the federal government gets the opportunity to work with some of America’s most innovative and nimble small businesses, often times with a direct line to the CEO.</p>
<p>In FY 2012, the federal government made real progress toward the 23 percent goal, with 22.25 percent or $89.9 billion in federal contracting dollars going to small businesses compared to 21.65 percent in FY 2011, with significant impact in key areas:</p>
<ul><li>For the first time, more agencies than ever before met or surpassed all of their prime contracting goals.</li>
<li>Also, for the first time, the federal government exceeded the goal for service disabled veterans.</li>
<li>The federal government had the highest percentage of contracts going to Small Disadvantage Businesses to date.</li>
</ul><p>As a result of a government wide focus on increasing small business contracting opportunities, during President Obama’s first term (FY2009 - FY2012) the federal government awarded $376.2 billion in federal contracting dollars to small businesses.  This is a $48.1 billion increase over the four preceding years even as we have seen reduced spending overall.</p>
<p>Also, since President Obama took office, the SBA has supported more than $132.61 billion in Federal government contracting dollars to small disadvantaged businesses.

</ul><p>SBA’s GCBD unit must implement effective and efficient strategies to monitor the agencies’ progress to goal, support small businesses interested in working with the government and encourage agencies to improve data quality when reporting their contracting activities.  SBA will increase its efforts to collaborate with and hold federal agencies accountable to achieving their goals.</p>

The primary opportunity being addressed is that a higher application return rate should result in a greater number of disaster survivors that will apply for disaster loan assistance and receive much needed Federal disaster assistance. SBA’s plan to increase the application return rate also ensures that SBA's disaster assistance resources for businesses, non-profit organizations, homeowners, and renters can be deployed quickly, effectively and efficiently in order to preserve jobs and help return small businesses to operation.</p>
<p>SBA’s plan to increase the application return rate will indirectly make the Disaster Loan Program more efficient by: 1) saving costs on mailing application packets to 100% of disaster survivors referred to SBA; and 2) freeing up resources dedicated to preparing and mailing application packets that can be utilized in other critical areas of the application screening process that directly impact processing times.</p>
