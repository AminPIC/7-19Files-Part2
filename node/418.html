            <div class="">
                <p>Providing access to capital has been one of the SBA’s critical strategies in meeting its objective to drive business formation, job growth and economic expansion particularly in underserved markets since the agency was created in 1953. By providing loan guarantees to reduce lenders’ loss exposure, the SBA provides an important credit lifeline to small businesses, especially startup businesses and businesses owned by women, minorities, veterans and other underserved groups who often cannot easily obtain credit in the  conventional market.  In the current economic conditions, SBA loan programs become even more crucial for ensuring that small businesses are not only surviving but also leading the way toward economic recovery and growth, as they have done time-and-time again throughout U.S. history.</p>
<p>SBA will increase small business access to capital by increasing the number of new or returning lenders in the fiscal year for the flagship 7(a) program (including the Community Advantage pilot program). New and returning lenders are a major component of SBA’s lending portfolio and are essential to growth in the quantity of loans approved and small businesses assisted. Each new or returning lender will expand SBA’s footprint and increase small business access to capital. Attaining a high volume of new and returning lenders from one fiscal year to the next will create a consistent pipeline of SBA loans into the hands of small business.</p>
<p>There are barriers and challenges to the SBA in achieving its priority goals:</p>
<ul><li>Economic Trends; micro and macro</li>
<li>Issues within the Finance Industry as a whole</li>
<li>Shrinking workforce in field offices which provide training</li>
<li>Recent cases from the OIG reviewing SBA lenders underwriting criteria have triggered a more cautious approach from some lenders with some loan guaranty types</li>
</ul>                            </div>

            <h2>Strategies</h2>
            <!--<div class="teaser collapsed">

            <div class="">
                <p>Two barriers to entering the SBA lending program are program complexities and program fees.  By focusing on continuous improvement to the loan programs and reducing borrower and lender fees, SBA will become more attractive to new and returning lenders. Specifically with the issuance of SOP 50 10 5(f) (effective 1/1/2014), the Office of Capital Access made several revisions to its policies to streamline, standardize, and simplify its loan program. Effective 10/1/2013, SBA eliminated borrower and lender fees for all 7(a) loans up to $150,000.  Effective 1/1/2014, SBA eliminated borrower and lender fees for SBA Express loans to Veteran owned businesses up to $350,000. These changes will lower the barriers of entry to new and returning banks, especially community banks.</p>
<p>In FY2014 and FY2015, the Office of Capital Access will continue improving the SBA loan programs and will work with trade groups, field offices, technology partners, and lenders themselves to communicate these improvements and assist lenders who are interested in joining SBA’s lending network.</p>

            <h2>Progress Update</h2>
            <div>
                <p>New and returning lenders are a major component of SBA's lending portfolio and are essential to growth in the quantity of loans approved.  Attaining a high volume of new and returning lenders from one fiscal year to the next creates a consistent pipeline of SBA loans for small businesses.  In FY 2015, SBA added 292 new and returning lenders towards its goal of 325.  These new and returning lenders made 752 loans for $260 million.  The number of new or returning lenders recruited slowed in the fourth quarter, particularly as fewer active lenders remain in busi­ness each year.  Bank mergers have also impacted the number of active lending partners providing 7(a) Loans. The priority goal to increase new and returning lenders has reduced the decline from FY 2012 to FY 2014.  </p>
<p>While the number of new and returning lenders is under target, the dollars of loans approved for 7(a) loans exceeded the FY 2015 goal.  The SBA's 7(a) loan program increased by 23% from previous fiscal year, leading to a record year of approvals.  This priority goal has helped expand SBA’s footprint to increase small business access to capital.  The SBA lending community has been very responsive to SBA’s strategy of fee relief and loan program improvement.  Actions taken to reverse the downward trend:</p>

</p>
                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>Providing access to capital has been one of the SBA’s critical strategies in meeting its objective to drive business formation, job growth and economic expansion particularly in underserved markets since the agency was created in 1953. By providing loan guarantees to reduce lenders’ loss exposure, the SBA provides an important credit lifeline to small businesses, especially startup businesses and businesses owned by women, minorities, veterans and other underserved groups who often cannot easily obtain credit in the  conventional market.  In the current economic conditions, SBA loan programs become even more crucial for ensuring that small businesses are not only surviving but also leading the way toward economic recovery and growth, as they have done time-and-time again throughout U.S. history.</p>
<p>SBA will increase small business access to capital by increasing the number of new or returning lenders in the fiscal year for the flagship 7(a) program (including the Community Advantage pilot program). New and returning lenders are a major component of SBA’s lending portfolio and are essential to growth in the quantity of loans approved and small businesses assisted. Each new or returning lender will expand SBA’s footprint and increase small business access to capital. Attaining a high volume of new and returning lenders from one fiscal year to the next will create a consistent pipeline of SBA loans into the hands of small business.</p>
<p>There are barriers and challenges to the SBA in achieving its priority goals:</p>
<ul><li>Economic Trends; micro and macro</li>
<li>Issues within the Finance Industry as a whole</li>
<li>Shrinking workforce in field offices which provide training</li>
<li>Recent cases from the OIG reviewing SBA lenders underwriting criteria have triggered a more cautious approach from some lenders with some loan guaranty types</li>

</p>
                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>Congress has mandated that small businesses receive <strong>23%</strong> of federal government prime contracting dollars, including <strong>5</strong><strong>% </strong>of prime and subcontracts to Small Disadvantage Businesses; <strong>5% </strong>of prime and subcontracts to Women-Owned Small Businesses; <strong>3% </strong>of prime and subcontracts to HUBZone Small Businesses; and <strong>3% </strong>of prime and subcontracts to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses</p>
<p>Meeting and exceeding the federal government’s small business procurement goals continues to be an Administration priority.  Federal contracting with small businesses is a win-win.  Small businesses get the revenue they need to grow their businesses and create jobs, and the federal government gets the opportunity to work with some of America’s most innovative and nimble small businesses, often times with a direct line to the CEO.</p>
<p>In FY 2012, the federal government made real progress toward the 23 percent goal, with 22.25 percent or $89.9 billion in federal contracting dollars going to small businesses compared to 21.65 percent in FY 2011, with significant impact in key areas:</p>
<ul><li>For the first time, more agencies than ever before met or surpassed all of their prime contracting goals.</li>
<li>Also, for the first time, the federal government exceeded the goal for service disabled veterans.</li>
<li>The federal government had the highest percentage of contracts going to Small Disadvantage Businesses to date.</li>
</ul><p>As a result of a government wide focus on increasing small business contracting opportunities, during President Obama’s first term (FY2009 - FY2012) the federal government awarded $376.2 billion in federal contracting dollars to small businesses.  This is a $48.1 billion increase over the four preceding years even as we have seen reduced spending overall.</p>
<p>Also, since President Obama took office, the SBA has supported more than $132.61 billion in Federal government contracting dollars to small disadvantaged businesses. This represents a 36.6 percent increase when compared to the prior Administration. Under the Bush Administration’s first term, $97.10 billion in federal government contracting dollars were awarded to small disadvantaged businesses.</p>
<p>Although we have seen marked success over the last few years, we know more must be done.  Many challenges exist for small businesses seeking to enter the federal procurement marketplace.</p>
<ul><li>The unpredictable and changing budget climate is a challenge for small businesses, and SBA is working hard to create an environment where small businesses can be successful in the federal procurement marketplace.</li>
<li>The instability and ambiguity caused by Continuing Resolutions make it difficult to agency acquisition staff to plan effectively for small business utilization.</li>
<li>Entering the federal supply chain can often be a lengthy and arduous process for many small businesses.</li>
</ul><p>SBA’s GCBD unit must implement effective and efficient strategies to monitor the agencies’ progress to goal, support small businesses interested in working with the government and encourage agencies to improve data quality when reporting their contracting activities.  SBA will increase its efforts to collaborate with and hold federal agencies accountable to achieving their goals.</p>

</p>
                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>The priority goal is directly tied to the objective of both the National Export Initiative (NEI) and the Export Promotion Cabinet (EPC) to expand SME access to trade financing, which has been identified as a gap issue for smaller exporters.  Increasing access to export financing, combined with trade counseling and training, will contribute to the enhanced ability of current and future U.S. small business exporters to succeed in the global marketplace and supports the cross-agency goal of doubling U.S. exports.</p>
<p> There are barriers and challenges to the SBA in achieving its priority goals:</p>
<ul><li>From a marketing perspective, communicating and disseminating trade financing information to lenders and small business exporters could provide challenging given current, and anticipated, budget constraints on staffing.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Inter-agency collaboration and joint initiatives can be challenging to manage, given the differing regulations and performance metrics of individual agencies, which might reduce the commitment of other agencies to help support this priority.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Unique, and sometimes additional, Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) requirements for core export loans vs. other 7(a) loan products can confuse lenders and may require the creation of “Lender Training Manuals,” more extensive lender training, and Office of Capital Access support in implementing needed SOP revisions.</li>
</ul><ul><li>In terms of operations, a reduced travel budget could greatly restrict the ability of field staff to deliver the necessary training to lenders and businesses that would expand the use of SBA loan programs for exporters, given that SBA's specialized trade finance specialists cover multiple states.</li>
</ul><ul><li>The banking sector could receive another “financial shock,” forcing it to tighten lending requirements to small businesses and/or Basel III capital requirements could limit lending capacity.*</li>
</ul><ul><li> U.S. export growth could slow, reducing demand for trade financing, as a result of slow overseas economic growth and/or a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, making U.S. exports less competitive.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>Trade financing historically has been perceived by many lenders, especially community banks, as being too complex to be incorporated into their suite of financial products. Working with other federal agencies, SBA will help reduce the complexity of USG trade financing and export marketing programs and highlight the growing importance of exports to the U.S. economy, thereby encouraging more lenders to offer comprehensive business solutions to their export customers.  In addition, SBA will leverage its outreach by working with state, federal, and other resource partners in order to promote customized trade financing options to the small business exporting community.</p>

The primary opportunity being addressed is that a higher application return rate should result in a greater number of disaster survivors that will apply for disaster loan assistance and receive much needed Federal disaster assistance. SBA’s plan to increase the application return rate also ensures that SBA's disaster assistance resources for businesses, non-profit organizations, homeowners, and renters can be deployed quickly, effectively and efficiently in order to preserve jobs and help return small businesses to operation.</p>
<p>SBA’s plan to increase the application return rate will indirectly make the Disaster Loan Program more efficient by: 1) saving costs on mailing application packets to 100% of disaster survivors referred to SBA; and 2) freeing up resources dedicated to preparing and mailing application packets that can be utilized in other critical areas of the application screening process that directly impact processing times.</p>

</p>
                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>Providing access to capital has been one of the SBA’s critical strategies in meeting its objective to drive business formation, job growth and economic expansion particularly in underserved markets since the agency was created in 1953. By providing loan guarantees to reduce lenders’ loss exposure, the SBA provides an important credit lifeline to small businesses, especially startup businesses and businesses owned by women, minorities, veterans and other underserved groups who often cannot easily obtain credit in the  conventional market.  In the current economic conditions, SBA loan programs become even more crucial for ensuring that small businesses are not only surviving but also leading the way toward economic recovery and growth, as they have done time-and-time again throughout U.S. history.</p>
<p>SBA will increase small business access to capital by increasing the number of new or returning lenders in the fiscal year for the flagship 7(a) program (including the Community Advantage pilot program). New and returning lenders are a major component of SBA’s lending portfolio and are essential to growth in the quantity of loans approved and small businesses assisted. Each new or returning lender will expand SBA’s footprint and increase small business access to capital. Attaining a high volume of new and returning lenders from one fiscal year to the next will create a consistent pipeline of SBA loans into the hands of small business.</p>
<p>There are barriers and challenges to the SBA in achieving its priority goals:</p>
<ul><li>Economic Trends; micro and macro</li>
<li>Issues within the Finance Industry as a whole</li>
<li>Shrinking workforce in field offices which provide training</li>
<li>Recent cases from the OIG reviewing SBA lenders underwriting criteria have triggered a more cautious approach from some lenders with some loan guaranty types</li>

</p>
                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>Congress has mandated that small businesses receive <strong>23%</strong> of federal government prime contracting dollars, including <strong>5</strong><strong>% </strong>of prime and subcontracts to Small Disadvantage Businesses; <strong>5% </strong>of prime and subcontracts to Women-Owned Small Businesses; <strong>3% </strong>of prime and subcontracts to HUBZone Small Businesses; and <strong>3% </strong>of prime and subcontracts to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses</p>
<p>Meeting and exceeding the federal government’s small business procurement goals continues to be an Administration priority.  Federal contracting with small businesses is a win-win.  Small businesses get the revenue they need to grow their businesses and create jobs, and the federal government gets the opportunity to work with some of America’s most innovative and nimble small businesses, often times with a direct line to the CEO.</p>
<p>In FY 2012, the federal government made real progress toward the 23 percent goal, with 22.25 percent or $89.9 billion in federal contracting dollars going to small businesses compared to 21.65 percent in FY 2011, with significant impact in key areas:</p>
<ul><li>For the first time, more agencies than ever before met or surpassed all of their prime contracting goals.</li>
<li>Also, for the first time, the federal government exceeded the goal for service disabled veterans.</li>
<li>The federal government had the highest percentage of contracts going to Small Disadvantage Businesses to date.</li>
</ul><p>As a result of a government wide focus on increasing small business contracting opportunities, during President Obama’s first term (FY2009 - FY2012) the federal government awarded $376.2 billion in federal contracting dollars to small businesses.  This is a $48.1 billion increase over the four preceding years even as we have seen reduced spending overall.</p>
<p>Also, since President Obama took office, the SBA has supported more than $132.61 billion in Federal government contracting dollars to small disadvantaged businesses. This represents a 36.6 percent increase when compared to the prior Administration. Under the Bush Administration’s first term, $97.10 billion in federal government contracting dollars were awarded to small disadvantaged businesses.</p>
<p>Although we have seen marked success over the last few years, we know more must be done.  Many challenges exist for small businesses seeking to enter the federal procurement marketplace.</p>
<ul><li>The unpredictable and changing budget climate is a challenge for small businesses, and SBA is working hard to create an environment where small businesses can be successful in the federal procurement marketplace.</li>
<li>The instability and ambiguity caused by Continuing Resolutions make it difficult to agency acquisition staff to plan effectively for small business utilization.</li>
<li>Entering the federal supply chain can often be a lengthy and arduous process for many small businesses.</li>
</ul><p>SBA’s GCBD unit must implement effective and efficient strategies to monitor the agencies’ progress to goal, support small businesses interested in working with the government and encourage agencies to improve data quality when reporting their contracting activities.  SBA will increase its efforts to collaborate with and hold federal agencies accountable to achieving their goals.</p>

</p>
                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:<span class="acc_content_label"><p>Providing access to capital has been one of the SBA’s critical strategies in meeting its objective to drive business formation, job growth, and economic expansion particularly in underserved markets since the Agency’s creation in 1953. By providing loan guarantees to reduce lenders’ loss exposure, the SBA provides an important credit lifeline to small businesses, especially startup businesses and businesses owned by women, minorities, veterans and other underserved groups that often cannot easily obtain credit in the  conventional market.  SBA loan programs are necessary to ensure that small businesses are not only surviving but also leading the way toward US economic expansion and growth.</p>
<p>The <strong>7(a) Loan</strong> program is the federal government’s primary small business loan program, assisting small businesses to obtain financing when they do not qualify for or otherwise have access to traditional credit.  The SBA guarantees a portion of each loan (typically 50 to 90%) that participating lenders make by using the adjusted credit standards of the 7(a) loan program.</p>
<p>SBA's FY 2014-2015 Priority Goal to increase new and returning 7(a) lenders has reduced the decline from FY 2012 to FY 2014.  SBA will continue to support small business access to capital by increasing the number of lenders participating in the flagship 7(a) loan program (including the Community Advantage pilot program). Lender participation is essential to growth in the quantity of loans approved and small businesses assisted. Attaining a high volume of lender participation will create a consistent pipeline of SBA loans to small businesses.</p>
<p>This Priority Goal directly supports SBA’s <a href="http://www.performance.gov/content/expand-access-capital">Strategic Objective 1.1</a> – Expand access to capital through SBA’s extensive lending network.  Access to capital is critical to the long-term success of America’s small businesses.  The top priority at the SBA is to get lending flowing to small businesses.</p>
<p>Key barriers and challenges:</p>
<ul><li>Economic Trends; micro- and macro-economic that impact whether banks want to provide SBA-backed loans such as:
<ul><li>Lender may not have the technology in  place to support migration to SBA systems</li>
<li>Some industries may have a high default rate and a risk that would not allow a lender to underwrite a SBA backed loan</li>
<li>Lender located in an area where some industries are effected by geographic factors that would make a risk (for example, Northeast Area has a big fishing industry that depends on weather, availability of product, regulations, etc.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bank mergers impact the number of lending partners providing 7(a) loan</li>
<li>Program awareness of SBA products and services and a shrinking workforce in field offices which provide training</li>
</ul></p>

</p>
                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:<span class="acc_content_label"><p>The priority goal is directly tied to the objective of both the National Export Initiative (NEI) and the Export Promotion Cabinet (EPC) to expand SME access to trade financing, which has been identified as a gap issue for smaller exporters.  Increasing access to export financing, combined with trade counseling and training, will contribute to the enhanced ability of current and future U.S. small business exporters to succeed in the global marketplace and supports the cross-agency goal of doubling U.S. exports.</p>
<p> There are barriers and challenges to the SBA in achieving its priority goals:</p>
<ul><li>From a marketing perspective, communicating and disseminating trade financing information to lenders and small business exporters could provide challenging given current, and anticipated, budget constraints on staffing.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Inter-agency collaboration and joint initiatives can be challenging to manage, given the differing regulations and performance metrics of individual agencies, which might reduce the commitment of other agencies to help support this priority.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Unique, and sometimes additional, Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) requirements for core export loans vs. other 7(a) loan products can confuse lenders and may require the creation of “Lender Training Manuals,” more extensive lender training, and Office of Capital Access support in implementing needed SOP revisions.</li>
</ul><ul><li>In terms of operations, a reduced travel budget could greatly restrict the ability of field staff to deliver the necessary training to lenders and businesses that would expand the use of SBA loan programs for exporters, given that SBA's specialized trade finance specialists cover multiple states.</li>
</ul><ul><li>The banking sector could receive another “financial shock,” forcing it to tighten lending requirements to small businesses and/or Basel III capital requirements could limit lending capacity.*</li>
</ul><ul><li> U.S. export growth could slow, reducing demand for trade financing, as a result of slow overseas economic growth and/or a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, making U.S. exports less competitive.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>Trade financing historically has been perceived by many lenders, especially community banks, as being too complex to be incorporated into their suite of financial products. Working with other federal agencies, SBA will help reduce the complexity of USG trade financing and export marketing programs and highlight the growing importance of exports to the U.S. economy, thereby encouraging more lenders to offer comprehensive business solutions to their export customers.  In addition, SBA will leverage its outreach by working with state, federal, and other resource partners in order to promote customized trade financing options to the small business exporting community.</p>

</p>
                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:<span class="acc_content_label"><p>Congress has mandated that small businesses receive <strong>23%</strong> of federal government prime contracting dollars, including <strong>5</strong><strong>% </strong>of prime and subcontracts to Small Disadvantage Businesses; <strong>5% </strong>of prime and subcontracts to Women-Owned Small Businesses; <strong>3% </strong>of prime and subcontracts to HUBZone Small Businesses; and <strong>3% </strong>of prime and subcontracts to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses</p>
<p>Meeting and exceeding the federal government’s small business procurement goals continues to be an Administration priority.  Federal contracting with small businesses is a win-win.  Small businesses get the revenue they need to grow their businesses and create jobs, and the federal government gets the opportunity to work with some of America’s most innovative and nimble small businesses, often times with a direct line to the CEO.</p>
<p>In FY 2012, the federal government made real progress toward the 23 percent goal, with 22.25 percent or $89.9 billion in federal contracting dollars going to small businesses compared to 21.65 percent in FY 2011, with significant impact in key areas:</p>
<ul><li>For the first time, more agencies than ever before met or surpassed all of their prime contracting goals.</li>
<li>Also, for the first time, the federal government exceeded the goal for service disabled veterans.</li>
<li>The federal government had the highest percentage of contracts going to Small Disadvantage Businesses to date.</li>
</ul><p>As a result of a government wide focus on increasing small business contracting opportunities, during President Obama’s first term (FY2009 - FY2012) the federal government awarded $376.2 billion in federal contracting dollars to small businesses.  This is a $48.1 billion increase over the four preceding years even as we have seen reduced spending overall.</p>
<p>Also, since President Obama took office, the SBA has supported more than $132.61 billion in Federal government contracting dollars to small disadvantaged businesses. This represents a 36.6 percent increase when compared to the prior Administration. Under the Bush Administration’s first term, $97.10 billion in federal government contracting dollars were awarded to small disadvantaged businesses.</p>
<p>Although we have seen marked success over the last few years, we know more must be done.  Many challenges exist for small businesses seeking to enter the federal procurement marketplace.</p>
<ul><li>The unpredictable and changing budget climate is a challenge for small businesses, and SBA is working hard to create an environment where small businesses can be successful in the federal procurement marketplace.</li>
<li>The instability and ambiguity caused by Continuing Resolutions make it difficult to agency acquisition staff to plan effectively for small business utilization.</li>
<li>Entering the federal supply chain can often be a lengthy and arduous process for many small businesses.</li>
</ul><p>SBA’s GCBD unit must implement effective and efficient strategies to monitor the agencies’ progress to goal, support small businesses interested in working with the government and encourage agencies to improve data quality when reporting their contracting activities.  SBA will increase its efforts to collaborate with and hold federal agencies accountable to achieving their goals.</p>
