            <div class="">
                <p>Background:</p>
<p>Reducing roadway fatalities continues to be a top priority at the Department of Transportation (DOT).  Roadway crashes are among the leading causes of death in the United States, especially among young people. In 2015, an estimated 35,200 people died on the Nation’s roadways and action must be taken to address this serious public health and safety problem.  The financial impact of roadway crashes also puts a significant burden on the Nation: approximately $871 billion per year in economic and societal losses underscores the magnitude of the problem.  Roadway crashes are one of the leading causes of traumatic brain injuries as well as permanent spinal cord injuries, putting a heavy burden on our medical systems.</p>
<p>The importance of improving transportation safety is reflected in DOT’s Strategic Plan. The Department strives to make the U.S. transportation system the safest in the world. DOT will work with all of its stakeholders — transportation agencies, elected officials, law enforcement, industry, safety advocates, novice drivers, the disability and older adult communities, and the public — to reduce transportation-related fatalities and injuries and make our roadway system safe for all users.</p>
<p>Progress toward a national roadway safety goal requires collaboration with a diverse group of stakeholders and partners across a range of disciplines.  Within DOT, the relevant operating administrations can leverage the respective resources and expertise to more effectively achieve a safer transportation environment. These organizations include the following:</p>
<ul><li>Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) provides Federal State and local partners the tools, resources, and information necessary to make sound safety investment decisions and coordinates with States to develop Strategic Highway Safety Plans (SHSP) and implement programs that improve the safety of roadway infrastructure on all public roads.</li>
<li>Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) promotes safe commercial motor vehicle (CMV) (large truck and bus) operations through education, innovation, regulation, enforcement, financial assistance, partnerships, and full accountability to reduce crashes, injuries, and fatalities on our Nation’s roadways involving CMVs.</li>
<li>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) develops vehicle safety standards, conducts research on new vehicle safety and technology, and oversees compliance, defect investigations and recalls.  NHTSA equally focuses on driver behavior by developing effective traffic safety programs, providing grant funds to States to implement these programs, and implementing national high visibility enforcement campaigns.</li>
</ul><p> </p>

            <h2>Strategies</h2>
            <!--<div class="teaser collapsed">
                                            </div>-->
            <div class="">
                <p>The Department has chosen to focus on DOT’s top safety initiatives in the next two years rather than document a large list of activities associated with established programs.  The top initiatives are designed to focus on solutions tailored to the specific issues contributing to roadway fatalities, and the Department believes that this set of initiatives and associated milestones will ultimately lead to improved outcomes and a reduction in roadway fatalities. The strategies and principles of the Roadway Safety Plan provide a roadmap for these initiatives:</p>
<p>PRINCIPLE 1:  Collaboration for Roadway Safety</p>
<p>Everyone has a stake in roadway safety.   The collaboration of all stakeholders will yield cross-cutting opportunities to improve roadway safety with the promise of stronger outcomes.  DOT will lead this collaboration within its operating administrations and through outreach to potential partners, starting with the development of a national roadway safety goal.</p>
<p>PRINCIPLE 2:  Safer Behaviors</p>
<p>The greatest potential for reducing crashes lies in the difficult task of transforming public and personal attitudes toward roadway safety.  Citizens should consider roadway deaths along with the attendant suffering and economic costs as unacceptable rather than inevitable.  A shift in safety culture will bring us closer to making these changes.  DOT can support the needed change by targeting at-risk operators and users through education and enforcement. Of current interest is distracted driving. which addresses drivers' use of handhed cell phones behind the wheel.</p>
<p>PRINCIPLE 3:  Safer Vehicles</p>
<p>Safer and smarter vehicles will prevent crashes or mitigate their severity.  DOT will continue to foster development of the engineering and technology critical to improved vehicle crash avoidance, crashworthiness, and communication.  The public needs to understand and demand current and innovative vehicle technologies that save lives.  Some of these innovations will enhance the safety of the user within the roadway environment through connectivity of the vehicle and the infrastructure.</p>
<p>PRINCIPLE 4:  Safer Roadways</p>
<p>The nation should have the safest roads in the world, not just for vehicles, but for all users.  Safer roadways will result from expanding improved infrastructure, safer design, using technological innovations and countermeasures, and integrating safety into all phases of the roadway life cycle.</p>
<p>PRINCIPLE 5:  Empower Communities</p>
<p>Local jurisdictions must be able to prioritize transportation objectives based on their own specific needs.  By developing data-driven roadway safety plans, communities can meet the needs of all the road users in their locality.  The Department will empower communities by enhancing state and local participation in safety planning processes, providing greater flexibility in their resources, and fostering linkages between safety and livability initiatives.</p>
<p>PRINCIPLE 6:  Accountability and Managing for Results</p>
<p>The public expects its roadway investment to produce tangible program results.  Program success is achieved through improved data, integrated planning, and measurable performance targets.  Greater accountability and results-oriented management will provide the transparency necessary to maintain the commitment and support to significantly reduce roadway fatalities.</p>

            <h2>Progress Update</h2>
            <div>
                <p>There were 35,092 motor vehicle traffic fatalities in the United States in 2015, a 7.2 percent increase from the 32,744 fatalities in 2014. An estimated 2.44 million people were injured in motor vehicle traffic crashes, an increase of 4.5 percent from 2014.  Overall, 2015 vehicle miles traveled (VMT) also increased by 3.5 percent from 2014 to 3,131 billion, the largest increase since 1992.  There were increases in fatalities across most categories.  Human choices were also a factor in the increase of fatalities.  For example, fatalities in distraction-affected crashes increased 8.8 percent. The number of fatalities in crashes involving an alcohol-impaired driver increased 3.2 percent.  Fatalities in speeding-related crashes increased 3 percent.  Unrestrained passenger vehicle occupant fatalities (those who were unbelted) increased by 4.9 percent to 9,874.  Passenger vehicles include passenger car, SUVs and light trucks.</p>
<p>Increases were seen across most modes of travel.  The number of passenger vehicle occupant fatalities increased by 6.6-percent from 2014, which accounted for 59 percent of the overall increase. The 2015 passenger vehicle fatality count (22,441) is the highest number since 2009.  </p>
<p>Motorcyclist fatalities increased 8.3-percent to 4,976.  In States without universal helmet laws, 58 percent of motor­cyclists killed in 2015 were not wearing helmets, as compared to 8 percent in States with universal helmet laws.</p>
<p>Pedestrian fatalities increased 9.5-percent from 2014.  The 2015 pedestrian fatality count (5,376) is the highest number since 1996. Pedalcyclist fatalities increased 12.2-percent from 2014. The 2015 pedalcyclist fatality count (818) is the highest number since 1995.</p>
<p>There were 295 bus crash-related fatalities in 2015, an increase from the 281 fatalities in 2014.</p>
<p>Finally, there were 4,067 fatalities in crashes involving large trucks, 4.1 percent more fatalities than in 2014, the highest since 2008. Of the 4,067 fatalities, 667 (16.4%) were occupants of large trucks, 10.1 percent were nonoccupants, and 73.5 per­cent were occupants of other vehicles. </p>
<p><strong>Stakeholders:</strong></p>
<p>FHWA, FMCSA, and NHTSA have formed strategic alliances with partners from a wide array of backgrounds to enhance and forward the Nation’s roadway safety agenda through guidance, technical assistance, and development of resource materials. Many stakeholders currently address transportation safety issues independently, through individual goals, plans, and activities. Some have implemented substantial safety initiatives, and these contributions are vital to maintaining and improving roadway safety. Involvement by multiple stakeholders provides opportunities for broader public outreach and for the development and implementation of cross-cutting roadway safety strategies reflecting the common interests of many parties.</p>
<p>Each partner offers unique strengths and abilities to assist each mode to deliver its programs and leverage resources in protecting the public on the Nation’s roadways.  Progress toward a national roadway safety goal requires collaboration with a diverse group of stakeholders and partners across a range of disciplines.  The agencies within DOT work with a network of partner organizations, such as State Highway Safety Offices, State transportation departments, Tribal governments, local and county traffic engineers, law enforcement agencies, public health associations, safety advocacy groups, the motorcoach industry, hazardous shipping businesses, interstate trucking operations and the auto industry on the development of evidence-based roadway safety programs, projects, and safety standards.  Such collaboration will help to integrate a broad range of factors affecting roadway safety and create more efficient and effective problem-solving synergies across the transportation industry.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<p>A number of challenges could slow down or even reverse positive trends.  Many States continue to face budget shortfalls and are under tremendous pressure to reduce services, resulting in cut backs to roadway safety programs.  Cutbacks in State, Tribal and local law enforcement agency budgets could weaken national enforcement campaigns and local traffic safety enforcement efforts.  States, Tribes, and local governments must be willing to use data-driven analytical processes to make the best and most effective safety investments.</p>
<p>Distracted driving has emerged as a new threat over the past few years as the rise of portable electronic devices has swiftly expanded.  Moreover, as in-vehicle electronic systems become ever more sophisticated and complex, distracted driving could become an even greater threat if it is not addressed in a manner keeping pace with technological advancements.  In fact, a new report by the Governors' Highway Safety Association (GHSA) cites 50 percent of the US adult population now owning smartphones and the wireless industry reports a subscription penetration rate of 102.2 percent (^1).  Also, as the economy continues to gain momentum, more recreational travel and driving may lead to higher crash rates.  Additionally, safety defects in vehicles that are not addressed in a safe and efficient manner can lead toward more serious vehicle crashes and injuries.  Finally, the repeal of proven life-saving traffic safety laws at the State level, such as universal motorcycle helmet or primary seat belt laws, could also result in higher injuries and fatalities.  Nevertheless, significant opportunities remain for continued progress in reducing roadway fatalities.  The Department will seek new and innovative ways to serve the American people and keep our roadways safe.</p>
<p>The FAST Act, Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act, was signed into law by President Obama on December 4, 2015.  With the passage of the FAST Act, all DOT surface operating administrations have been updating their implementation plans to accommodate the new requirements and authorities contained in the act. This five-year reauthorization bill includes additional motor vehicle safety measures, such as the authority to prohibit rental car companies from knowingly renting vehicles that are subject to safety recalls.  It also increased maximum fines against non-compliant auto manufactures from $35 million to $105 million.  The law also will help streamlines the Federal truck and bus safety grant programs, giving more flexibility to States to improve safety in these areas.  </p>

                                <p><p>Roadway crashes are among the leading causes of death in the United States, especially amongst young people ages 3 through 34.  The highest priority of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is to improve safety.  For roadway safety, to achieve this goal, the DOT uses a multi-faceted approach that seeks to develop safer roads and vehicles, and safer behaviors by all road users:  drivers, passengers, pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorcyclists.  The primary indicator is the national roadway fatality rate, which is a ratio of the number of fatalities over the total vehicle miles traveled.  Including the number of vehicle miles traveled in the equation allows DOT to factor elements that contribute to the rise or fall of fatalities, such as fluctuations in fuel prices, weather, and economic conditions.</p>
<p>The 2014 fatality rate represents a 2 percent decrease over 2013, and a 22 percent decline over the past 10 years.  Additional subgoals are:</p>
<p>(a)  Reduce passenger vehicle occupant fatalities per 100 million passenger vehicle VMT to 0.82 in 2017.</p>
<p>(b)  Reduce motorcycle rider fatalities per 100 thousand motorcycle registrations to 58 in 2017.</p>
<p>(c)  Reduce non-occupant (pedestrian and bicycle) fatalities per 100,000 population to 1.78 in 2017.</p>
<p>(d)  Reduce roadway fatalities involving large trucks and buses per 100 million VMT to 0.114 in 2017.</p>

<ul><li>An increase in the spending rate of the Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) and roadway infrastructure improvements such as Safety Edge, Innovative Intersection and Interchange Geometrics, and High Friction Surface Treatments, which are some of the innovative technologies being deployed as part of the Federal Highway Administration’s (FHWA’s) <em>Every Day Counts</em> (EDC) initiative.</li>
<li>High visibility enforcement campaigns (HVE) such as<em> Click It or Ticket </em>to increase seatbelt use along with other HVE efforts to reduce drunk driving and distracted driving.</li>
<li>Enactment of effective traffic safety laws at the State level on seat belts, child passenger safety, impaired driving, distracted driving, and Graduate Driving Licensing (GDL). </li>
<li>Better oversight of licensing for young drivers and commercial operators.</li>
<li>Safer vehicles also played an important role in reducing crashes, injuries, and fatalities. Electronic stability control systems (ESC) alone saved an estimated 3,900 lives between 2008 and 2012.  This will likely  increase each year as more of the overall vehicle fleet is equipped with ESC. Advanced new crash avoidance technology, such as automatic emergency braking systems and vehicle-to-vehicle communications hold great promise and represent the next generation of vehicle safety technology. </li>

<p>In 2015, 4,976 motorcyclists died in crashes, the highest number since 2012. This was an increase of 8.3 percent from 2014. According to 2015 figures, in States without universal helmet laws, 58 percent of motorcyclists killed were not wearing helmets, as compared to 8 percent in States with universal helmet laws.</p>
<p>In 2015, 5,376 pedestrians were killed. This was an increase over 9.5 percent from 2014. This was the highest number since 1996. Pedalcyclist fatalities, 818 in 2015, increased 12.2 percent from 2014, the highest number since 1995.</p>
<p>There were 295 bus crash-related fatalities in 2015, an increase from the 281 fatalities in 2014. Finally, there were 4,067 fatalities in crashes involving large trucks, which is 4.1 percent more fatalities than in 2014, and the highest since 2008. Of the 4,067 fatalities, 16.4 percent were occupants of large trucks, 10.1 percent were non-occupants, and 73.5 percent were occupants of other vehicles.</p>

<p>The 2014 fatality rate represents a 2 percent decrease over 2013, and a 22 percent decline over the past 10 years.  Additional subgoals are:</p>
<p>(a)  Reduce passenger vehicle occupant fatalities per 100 million passenger vehicle VMT to 0.82 in 2017.</p>
<p>(b)  Reduce motorcycle rider fatalities per 100 thousand motorcycle registrations to 58 in 2017.</p>
<p>(c)  Reduce non-occupant (pedestrian and bicycle) fatalities per 100,000 population to 1.78 in 2017.</p>
<p>(d)  Reduce roadway fatalities involving large trucks and buses per 100 million VMT to 0.114 in 2017.</p>

<p>In 2010, 4,502 motorcyclists were killed—a slight increase from the 4,469 motorcyclists killed in 2009.  This rate has leveled off from a high of 43.77 in 2005.  In 2010, motorcyclists accounted for 14 percent of total traffic fatalities, 16 percent of all occupant fatalities, and 4 percent of all occupants injured.</p>
<p>Motorcycles made up 3 percent of all registered vehicles in the United States in 2010 and accounted for only 0.6 percent of all vehicle miles traveled. Per vehicle mile traveled in 2010, motorcyclists were about 30 times more likely than passenger car occupants to die in a motor vehicle traffic crash.  Per registered vehicle, the fatality rate for motorcyclists in 2010 was 6 times the fatality rate for passenger car occupants. From 2001 to 2010, motorcyclist fatalities increased by 41 percent. Among those increases, the 40 and older age group made up 39 percent of motorcyclists killed in 2001 as compared to 56 percent in 2010. Within this motorcyclist age group, fatalities increased by 100 percent over a 10-year period. Data has also shown, the average age of motorcycle riders killed in motor vehicle traffic crashes was 42.</p>
<p>Over half of all motorcycles involved in fatal crashes collided with another type of motor vehicle in transport. In two-vehicle crashes, 75 percent of the motorcycles involved were struck in the front. Only 6 percent were struck in the rear.</p>
<p>Motorcycles are more likely to be involved in a fatal collision with a fixed object than are other vehicles. In 2010, 24 percent of the motorcycles involved in fatal crashes collided with fixed objects, compared to 18 percent for passenger cars, 13 percent for light trucks, and 4 percent for large trucks.</p>
<p>In 2010, 1,214 (29%) of all fatally injured motorcycle riders had BAC levels of .08 g/ dL or higher. An additional 338 (8 %) had lower alcohol levels (BAC .01 to .07 g/ dL). Almost one fourth of all motorcycle riders involved in a fatal crash did not have valid licenses.</p>
<p>NHTSA estimates that helmets saved the lives of 1,550 motorcyclists in 2010. If all motorcyclists had worn helmets, an additional 706 lives could have been saved. According to NHTSA’s National Occupant Protection Use Survey, use of DOT-compliant helmets in 2010 stood at 54 percent, a decrease from 67 percent in 2009.</p>
<p>In 2010, 20 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico required helmet use by all motorcyclists. Whereas 27 States only required helmet use by a subset of motorcyclists (typically motorcyclists under age 18) and 3 States (Illinois, Iowa, and New Hampshire) do not require helmet use by motorcyclists of any age.</p>
<p>Sixty-six percent of motorcyclists killed in 2010 were not wearing helmets in States without universal helmet laws, as compared to 10 percent in States with universal helmet laws.</p>

                                <p><p>In FY 2016, DOT is changing the scale of this indicator to measure fatalities per capita by units of 100,000 persons.  This will better align with the DOT Strategic Plan and address concerns that pedestrian and bicyclist fatalities should be measured against population numbers.</p>
<p>The primary indicator of the Agency Priority Goal is the national fatality rate, which is a ratio of the number of fatalities over the total vehicle miles traveled.  Including the number of vehicle miles traveled in the equation allows DOT to factor elements that contribute to the rise or fall of fatalities, such as fluctuations in fuel prices, weather, and economic conditions. The number of non-occupant fatalities will still be a contributing subgoal to the national fatality rate.</p>

</div>                                <div class='data-items'><span>Indicator Overview:</span> <p>In FY 2016, DOT is changing the scale of this indicator to measure fatalities per capita by units of 100,000 persons.  This will better align with the DOT Strategic Plan and address concerns that pedestrian and bicyclist fatalities should be measured against population numbers.</p>
<p>The primary indicator of the Agency Priority Goal is the national fatality rate, which is a ratio of the number of fatalities over the total vehicle miles traveled.  Including the number of vehicle miles traveled in the equation allows DOT to factor elements that contribute to the rise or fall of fatalities, such as fluctuations in fuel prices, weather, and economic conditions. The number of non-occupant fatalities will still be a contributing subgoal to the national fatality rate.</p>

The number of passenger vehicle occupant fatalities is a contributing subgoal to the national fatality rate.</p>

</p>
                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>Background:</p>
<p>Reducing roadway fatalities continues to be a top priority at the Department of Transportation (DOT).  Roadway crashes are among the leading causes of death in the United States, especially among young people. Over the past 10 years, there has been a 25 percent reduction in the number of fatalities on the Nation’s roadways. In 2014, there were a projected 32,675 motor vehicle fatalities. This decline in fatalities shows a continuation in the general trend downward in fatalities that started in 2006.  In fact, the projected 2014 fatality rate of 1.08 per 100 vehicle million miles traveled (VMT) is the lowest ever recorded.</p>
<p>The importance of improving transportation safety is reflected in DOT’s Strategic Plan. The Department strives to make the U.S. transportation system the safest in the world. DOT will work with all of its stakeholders — transportation agencies, elected officials, law enforcement, industry, safety advocates, novice drivers, the disability and older adult communities, and the public — to reduce transportation-related fatalities and injuries and make our roadway system safe for all users.</p>
<p>Progress toward a national roadway safety goal requires collaboration with a diverse group of stakeholders and partners across a range of disciplines.  Within DOT, the relevant operating administrations can leverage the respective resources and expertise to more effectively achieve a safer transportation environment. These organizations include the following:</p>
<ul><li>Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) provides Federal State and local partners the tools, resources, and information necessary to make sound safety investment decisions and coordinates with States to develop Strategic Highway Safety Plans (SHSP) and implement programs that improve the safety of roadway infrastructure on all public roads.</li>
<li>Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) promotes safe commercial motor vehicle (CMV) (large truck and bus) operations through education, innovation, regulation, enforcement, financial assistance, partnerships, and full accountability to reduce crashes, injuries, and fatalities on our Nation’s roadways involving CMVs.</li>
<li>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) develops vehicle safety standards, conducts research on new vehicle safety and technology, and oversees compliance, defect investigations and recalls.  NHTSA equally focuses on driver behavior by developing effective traffic safety programs, providing grant funds to States to implement these programs, and implementing national high visibility enforcement campaigns.</li>
</ul><p>Roadway fatalities impact all road users, including drivers, passengers, pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclists, commercial vehicle operators, and those who work to build and maintain the Nation’s four million miles of roadways. The  Federal government is the only entity that has the authority to establish national safety standards for vehicles, regulate interstate motor carriers, and mandate roadway safety features.</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholders:</strong></p>
<p>FHWA, FMCSA, and NHTSA have formed strategic alliances with partners from a wide array of backgrounds to enhance and forward the Nation’s roadway safety agenda through guidance, technical assistance, and development of resource materials. Many stakeholders currently address transportation safety issues independently, through individual goals, plans, and activities. Some have implemented substantial safety initiatives, and these contributions are vital to maintaining and improving roadway safety. As described in the RSP, involvement by multiple stakeholders provides opportunities for broader public outreach and for the development and implementation of cross-cutting roadway safety strategies reflecting the common interests of many parties.</p>
<p>Each partner offers unique strengths and abilities to assist each mode to deliver its programs and leverage resources in protecting the public on the Nation’s roadways.  Progress toward a national roadway safety goal requires collaboration with a diverse group of stakeholders and partners across a range of disciplines.  The agencies within DOT work with a network of partner organizations, such as State Highway Safety Offices, State transportation departments, Tribal governments, local and county traffic engineers, law enforcement agencies, public health associations, safety advocacy groups, the motorcoach industry, hazardous shipping businesses, interstate trucking operations and the auto industry on the development of evidence-based roadway safety programs, projects, and safety standards.  Such collaboration will help to integrate a broad range of factors affecting roadway safety and create more efficient and effective problem-solving synergies across the transportation industry.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<p>A number of challenges could slow down or even reverse positive trends.  Many States continue to face budget shortfalls and are under tremendous pressure to reduce services, resulting in cut backs to roadway safety programs.  Cutbacks in State, Tribal and local law enforcement agency budgets could weaken national enforcement campaigns and local traffic safety enforcement efforts.  States, Tribes, and local governments must be willing to use data-driven analytical processes to make the best and most effective safety investments.</p>
<p>Distracted driving has emerged as a new threat over the past few years as the rise of portable electronic devices has swiftly expanded.   Moreover, as in-vehicle electronic systems become ever more sophisticated and complex, distracted driving could become an even greater threat if it is not addressed in a manner keeping pace with technological advancements.  In fact, a new report by the Governors' Highway Safety Association (GHSA) cites 50 percent of the US adult population now owning smartphones and the wireless industry reports a subscription penetration rate of 102.2 percent (^1).  Also, as the economy continues to gain momentum, more recreational travel and driving may lead to higher crash rates.  Additionally, safety defects in vehicles that are not addressed in a safe and efficiently manner can lead toward more serious vehicle crashes and injuries.  Finally, the repeal of proven life-saving traffic safety laws at the State level, such as universal motorcycle helmet or primary seat belt laws, could also result in higher injuries and fatalities.  Nevertheless, significant opportunities remain for continued progress in reducing roadway fatalities.  The Department will seek new and innovative ways to serve the American people and keep our roadways safe.</p>
<p>MAP-21, The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (P.L 112-141), was signed into law by President Obama on July 6, 2012.  MAP-21 provides an increase in safety funds available for the Highway Safety Improvement Program along with a focus on performance-based programming.  Implementation of MAP-21 will rely heavily on increased partnership across State agencies with DOT.  Additionally, the shift to performance-based programming may require additional effort on the part of some States.  There are also challenges associated with improving safety with local roads and local agencies with Federal-aid program funds, as well as the capacity and willingness of States to use data-driven and analytical processes to make the best safety infrastructure investments.</p>

<li>Laying the groundwork, through corridor and state planning, for future high-speed rail services.</li>
</ul><p>For the High-Speed and Intercity Passenger Rail Program, FRA selected 153 projects across the country, with nearly 85 percent of rail investments concentrated in 6 corridors (San Francisco-Los Angeles, Boston-New York City-Washington, D.C., Seattle-Portland-Eugene, Charlotte-Washington, D.C., Chicago-St. Louis, and Chicago-Detroit). These corridors are in five mega-regions, in which about 65 percent of the U.S. population resides and which will likely absorb the bulk of future population growth.</p>
<p>FRA has developed a sophisticated grants management apparatus, laid the foundation for sustainable long-term passenger rail improvements, and strengthened industry capacity to deliver rail projects through technical assistance and strategic initiatives. FRA is strongly committed to robust stakeholder outreach, communication, and collaboration as central components of program management, allowing FRA to identify program improvements, engage in project planning and development, and provide the support necessary for grantees to carry out projects successfully.</p>

                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:<span class="acc_content_label"><p>Air traffic control systems can improve the efficiency of airspace. As of December 2014, ERAM achieved Initial Operation Capability at all 20 Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs).  By March 2015, all 20 Air Route Traffic Control Centers will have achieved Operational Readiness Date (ORD) for ERAM.</p>
<p>The En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) System replaces the 40-year-old En Route HOST Computer System and backup system used at 20 FAA ARTCCs around the country.  ERAM is the main computer system air traffic controllers use to guide airplanes flying at high altitudes.  Air traffic control towers, terminal radar approach control facilities, the Air Traffic Control System Command Center, flight service stations, and other agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense, all connect to and use the information managed by the En Route HOST Computer System.  The original HOST computer software architecture was developed in the late 1960s and was implemented as National Airspace System (NAS) Stage A in the early 1970s.</p>
<p>For controllers, ERAM provides a user-friendly interface with customizable displays.  Trajectory modeling is more accurate than in HOST, allowing maximum airspace use, better conflict detection, and improved decision making.  ERAM will substantially increase the number of flights that can be tracked and displayed to controllers from 1,100 to 1,900.  The ERAM system also provides two functionally identical channels with dual redundancy, providing a more robust back-up capability than today's environment.  Coverage will also extend beyond facility boundaries, enabling controllers to handle additional traffic more efficiently because ERAM is designed to process data from up to 64 radars instead of the current 24.  The ERAM system is needed to replace the current HOST system and allow the FAA to continue to provide the high level of safe, reliable air traffic control services that the nation has come to expect; and also put in place the infrastructure necessary to transition the NAS to NextGen.</p>

                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Statement:<span class="acc_content_label"><p>Reduce the rate of roadway fatalities from 1.26 in 2008 to 1.03 per 100 million vehicle miles traveled (VMT) by December 31, 2018.</p>
</p>
                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:<span class="acc_content_label"><p>Background:</p>
<p>Reducing roadway fatalities continues to be a top priority at the Department of Transportation (DOT).  Roadway crashes are among the leading causes of death in the United States, especially among young people. Over the past 10 years, there has been a 25 percent reduction in the number of fatalities on the Nation’s roadways. In 2014, there were a projected 32,675 motor vehicle fatalities. This decline in fatalities shows a continuation in the general trend downward in fatalities that started in 2006.  In fact, the projected 2014 fatality rate of 1.08 per 100 vehicle million miles traveled (VMT) is the lowest ever recorded.</p>
<p>The importance of improving transportation safety is reflected in DOT’s Strategic Plan. The Department strives to make the U.S. transportation system the safest in the world. DOT will work with all of its stakeholders — transportation agencies, elected officials, law enforcement, industry, safety advocates, novice drivers, the disability and older adult communities, and the public — to reduce transportation-related fatalities and injuries and make our roadway system safe for all users.</p>
<p>Progress toward a national roadway safety goal requires collaboration with a diverse group of stakeholders and partners across a range of disciplines.  Within DOT, the relevant operating administrations can leverage the respective resources and expertise to more effectively achieve a safer transportation environment. These organizations include the following:</p>
<ul><li>Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) provides Federal State and local partners the tools, resources, and information necessary to make sound safety investment decisions and coordinates with States to develop Strategic Highway Safety Plans (SHSP) and implement programs that improve the safety of roadway infrastructure on all public roads.</li>
<li>Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) promotes safe commercial motor vehicle (CMV) (large truck and bus) operations through education, innovation, regulation, enforcement, financial assistance, partnerships, and full accountability to reduce crashes, injuries, and fatalities on our Nation’s roadways involving CMVs.</li>
<li>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) develops vehicle safety standards, conducts research on new vehicle safety and technology, and oversees compliance, defect investigations and recalls.  NHTSA equally focuses on driver behavior by developing effective traffic safety programs, providing grant funds to States to implement these programs, and implementing national high visibility enforcement campaigns.</li>
</ul><p>Roadway fatalities impact all road users, including drivers, passengers, pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclists, commercial vehicle operators, and those who work to build and maintain the Nation’s four million miles of roadways. The  Federal government is the only entity that has the authority to establish national safety standards for vehicles, regulate interstate motor carriers, and mandate roadway safety features.</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholders:</strong></p>
<p>FHWA, FMCSA, and NHTSA have formed strategic alliances with partners from a wide array of backgrounds to enhance and forward the Nation’s roadway safety agenda through guidance, technical assistance, and development of resource materials. Many stakeholders currently address transportation safety issues independently, through individual goals, plans, and activities. Some have implemented substantial safety initiatives, and these contributions are vital to maintaining and improving roadway safety. As described in the RSP, involvement by multiple stakeholders provides opportunities for broader public outreach and for the development and implementation of cross-cutting roadway safety strategies reflecting the common interests of many parties.</p>
<p>Each partner offers unique strengths and abilities to assist each mode to deliver its programs and leverage resources in protecting the public on the Nation’s roadways.  Progress toward a national roadway safety goal requires collaboration with a diverse group of stakeholders and partners across a range of disciplines.  The agencies within DOT work with a network of partner organizations, such as State Highway Safety Offices, State transportation departments, Tribal governments, local and county traffic engineers, law enforcement agencies, public health associations, safety advocacy groups, the motorcoach industry, hazardous shipping businesses, interstate trucking operations and the auto industry on the development of evidence-based roadway safety programs, projects, and safety standards.  Such collaboration will help to integrate a broad range of factors affecting roadway safety and create more efficient and effective problem-solving synergies across the transportation industry.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<p>A number of challenges could slow down or even reverse positive trends.  Many States continue to face budget shortfalls and are under tremendous pressure to reduce services, resulting in cut backs to roadway safety programs.  Cutbacks in State, Tribal and local law enforcement agency budgets could weaken national enforcement campaigns and local traffic safety enforcement efforts.  States, Tribes, and local governments must be willing to use data-driven analytical processes to make the best and most effective safety investments.</p>
<p>Distracted driving has emerged as a new threat over the past few years as the rise of portable electronic devices has swiftly expanded.   Moreover, as in-vehicle electronic systems become ever more sophisticated and complex, distracted driving could become an even greater threat if it is not addressed in a manner keeping pace with technological advancements.  In fact, a new report by the Governors' Highway Safety Association (GHSA) cites 50 percent of the US adult population now owning smartphones and the wireless industry reports a subscription penetration rate of 102.2 percent (^1).  Also, as the economy continues to gain momentum, more recreational travel and driving may lead to higher crash rates.  Additionally, safety defects in vehicles that are not addressed in a safe and efficiently manner can lead toward more serious vehicle crashes and injuries.  Finally, the repeal of proven life-saving traffic safety laws at the State level, such as universal motorcycle helmet or primary seat belt laws, could also result in higher injuries and fatalities.  Nevertheless, significant opportunities remain for continued progress in reducing roadway fatalities.  The Department will seek new and innovative ways to serve the American people and keep our roadways safe.</p>
<p>MAP-21, The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (P.L 112-141), was signed into law by President Obama on July 6, 2012.  MAP-21 provides an increase in safety funds available for the Highway Safety Improvement Program along with a focus on performance-based programming.  Implementation of MAP-21 will rely heavily on increased partnership across State agencies with DOT.  Additionally, the shift to performance-based programming may require additional effort on the part of some States.  There are also challenges associated with improving safety with local roads and local agencies with Federal-aid program funds, as well as the capacity and willingness of States to use data-driven and analytical processes to make the best safety infrastructure investments.</p>

Between 2001 and 2010, an average of 13 people in the United States died every year in incidents related to the transportation of hazardous material—a rate of one death for every 21 billion ton-miles of hazardous material moved.  In addition to causing deaths and injuries, hazardous material transportation incidents disrupt communities when people are evacuated from their homes, business activity is curtailed, and transportation services are interrupted.  We will continue to develop and encourage the use of safety tools - such as improved data collection, risk management practices, and incident response planning - to prevent, mitigate, and respond to hazardous material transportation accidents.</p>
