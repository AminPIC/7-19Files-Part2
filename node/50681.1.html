                <p>USAID with its partners in the U.S. Government (USG) and the global community are committed to the goal of ending preventable child and maternal deaths.  While many challenges remain, today more than ever, we are equipped with the tools and knowledge to reach this goal. Child deaths nearly halved from 1990 to 2013, saving an estimated 100 million child lives. Maternal deaths decreased by 45 percent over the same period. Between 2001 and 2013, malaria mortality rates decreased globally by 47 percent and by 54 percent in Africa alone. Estimates indicate that more than four million global malaria-related deaths were averted, primarily in children under five in Africa.  Rates of modern contraceptive use have increased from 12 percent in 1990 to 31 percent in 2013 in the countries with the largest USAID-supported programs, enabling healthy timing and spacing of pregnancies, which could lower child deaths by 25 percent and cut maternal deaths by 30 percent.  USAID reduced stunting, caused by a lack of essential vitamins and nutrients during early years and by frequent illness that robs growing bodies of the capacity to utilize available nutrients, from 55.6 percent in 1990 to 37.7 percent in 2014 in its 19 nutrition-focus countries. </p>
<p>To continue progress on these issues, USAID focuses its work to end preventable child and maternal deaths in 24 high burden countries around the world.  These 24 countries account for approximately 70 percent of maternal and child deaths and 50 percent of the global unmet need for family planning.  USAID selected these countries because of the magnitude and severity of child and maternal deaths, high country commitment, and the greatest potential to leverage U.S. Government programs, as well as those of other partners and donors.</p>
<p>By analyzing the causes of child and maternal death and the current coverage of life-saving interventions, USAID has identified the investments that will have the greatest impact. In the <a href="http://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1864/USAID_ActingOnTheCall_2014.pdf"><em>Acting on the Call</em></a> report, released in June 2014, USAID developed a plan of action for the 24 priority countries.  These plans quantified the potential impact on lives saved if USAID scaled high impact interventions at rates previously achieved by countries with similar characteristics (so-called “best performers”).  This information allows the global community to sharpen implementation of these high-impact interventions and align investments for maximum efficiency.</p>

            <div class="">
                <p>USAID’s approach to ending preventable child and maternal deaths, as outlined in the <a href="http://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1864/USAID_ActingOnTheCall_2014.pdf"><em>Acting on the Call</em></a> report, is informed by the documented successes of countries that have adopted effective interventions.  Buoyed by the momentum to reach the Millennium Development Goals, USAID is poised for the upcoming Sustainable Development Goals.  The U.S. Government’s contributions to global efforts are demonstrated in the millions of child and maternal lives saved during the past six years.  In USAID’s 24 priority countries,<u>[1]</u> 770,000 child lives were saved and 6,200 maternal deaths were averted in 2013 alone as compared to 2008. Ending preventable child and maternal deaths is not an outcome of U.S. Government assistance alone, nor is it solely the outcome of narrowly defined programs in maternal and child health (MCH). Rather, improvements in mortality outcomes are the result of increasingly effective efforts to link diverse health programs─MCH, malaria, family planning (FP), HIV/AIDS, and sanitation and hygiene improvement.  All of these efforts contribute to ending preventable child and maternal deaths.</p>
<p>Family Planning (FP) continues to drive down both maternal and child mortality by enabling families to achieve healthy timing and spacing of births. Countries are advancing toward the global goal of meeting 75 percent of demand for modern contraceptive methods. This is due, in part, to progress in expanding access to FP services. Activities will also support the key elements of successful FP programs, including mobilizing demand for modern FP services through behavior change communication; commodity supply and logistics; service delivery; policy analysis and planning; biomedical, social science, and program research; knowledge management; and monitoring and evaluation. Priority areas include leveraging opportunities to expand services through MCH and HIV platforms; contraceptive security; community-based approaches; expanding access to voluntary long-acting and permanent contraceptive methods; promoting healthy birth spacing; and focusing on cross-cutting issues of gender, youth, and equity.</p>
<p>USAID’s strategy to accelerate reduction in preventable maternal deaths includes the promotion of respectful care and high-impact interventions for the major causes of death, especially postpartum hemorrhage and preeclampsia/eclampsia; strengthening health systems; and changing family and community behaviors to access maternity care. USAID programs take into account and address cultural and financial factors that limit utilization of life-saving care. Programs pay special attention to strengthening care during labor, delivery, and the vital first 24 hours postpartum, a particularly vulnerable time for women and their infants.</p>
<p>Reducing the number of babies who die in the first 28 days of life continues to be a key part of USAID’s strategy.  The two dozen priority countries have decreased newborn deaths at a faster pace than the world as a whole (3.05 percent annual rate of reduction per year in USAID-priority countries versus 2.88 percent globally from 2000-2013). Despite this success, neonatal mortality still accounts for nearly half of the deaths among children under five years old ─ and USAID’s priority countries made up more than two-thirds of those deaths in 2013. Common causes of newborn mortality (such as premature birth and asphyxia) are difficult to diagnose and treat, which is why a greater portion of child deaths occur in the newborn period. Ensuring that babies survive those first days of life remains a top priority.</p>
<p>Vaccines are another critical life-saving intervention. Recently, six of the 24 priority countries reached the important Global Vaccine Action Plan milestone of maintained coverage for three consecutive years of more than 90 percent of children receiving their third dose of the diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (DPT3) vaccine.  By 2014, many of the 24 priority countries had adopted new and underutilized vaccines into their routine immunization systems: 17 introduced pneumococcal vaccines, 13 introduced rotavirus vaccines, and 12 introduced the second dose of measles vaccine in the second year of life.  Current efforts focus on establishing the systems and ground work needed to introduce these vaccines in all 24 countries.</p>
<p>Undernutrition, which is a type of malnutrition that includes stunting, wasting and micronutrient deficiencies, contributes to almost half of all the deaths of children under five by undermining all aspects of their health and development. A stunted child is 4.6 times more likely to die from infectious diseases compared to a non-stunted child. The problem is complex and difficult to tackle because many factors from health to agriculture and overall development influence stunting. Yet, USAID, incorporating activities under the Feed the Future Initiative (FTF), contributed to reducing stunting by nearly two percent in 19 FTF nutrition countries from 2013 to 2014. Activities focus on the prevention of undernutrition through integrated services. These include nutrition education to improve maternal diets, nutrition during pregnancy, exclusive breastfeeding, and infant and young child feeding practices; diet quality and diversification through fortified or biofortified staple foods, specialized food products, and community gardens; and delivery of nutrition services such as micronutrient supplementation and community management of acute malnutrition.</p>

            <h2>Progress Update</h2>
            <div>
                <p><em>Overview</em></p>
<p>USAID, with its partners in the U.S. Government and the global community, is committed to the goal of ending preventable child and maternal deaths (EPCMD).  All women deserve to give birth safely, and all children — no matter where they are born — deserve the same chance to survive and thrive.</p>
<p>Over the past two and a half decades, the world has reduced child mortality by more than half, and maternal mortality by nearly as much.  This means that 18,000 more children and 650 more mothers will survive today, than each day in 1990.  Despite this progress, 5.9 million children under age five still die each year, almost 1 million of them on their first day of life, and 303,000 women die annually during what should be one of the happiest days in their life.  The vast majority of these deaths are caused by complications and illnesses for which there are known, affordable treatments. </p>
<p>USAID focuses on ending preventable child and maternal deaths in the following 25 priority countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Haiti, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Rwanda, Senegal, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Yemen, and Zambia.  USAID chose these countries based on highest need, demonstrable commitment, and the greatest opportunity to save lives.  In priority countries, USAID is working with national governments, partners, civil society, and faith based organizations to support national health plans and improve access to quality services for women and children.  Notably, all fiscal year (FY) 2016 results reflect progress in USAID’s 24 priority countries (excluding Myanmar, as data are not yet available).  USAID’s approach to ending preventable child and maternal deaths, as outlined in the <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/ActingOnTheCall">Acting on the Call Report</a>, is informed by the documented successes of countries that have adopted effective interventions, buoyed by the momentum to reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and poised for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  The U.S. Government’s contributions to global efforts are evident in the millions of child and maternal lives saved during the past six years.</p>
<p>Ending preventable child and maternal deaths is not an outcome of U.S. Government assistance alone, nor is it solely the outcome of narrowly defined programs in maternal and child health (MCH).  Rather, improvements in mortality outcomes are the result of increasingly effective efforts to link diverse health programs –MCH, malaria, family planning, nutrition, HIV/AIDS, and sanitation and hygiene.  All of these efforts contribute to ending preventable child and maternal deaths.</p>
<p>In FY 2016, USAID reached a global coverage across its 24 USAID-priority countries for the percentage of births attended by a skilled doctor, nurse, or midwife (SBA) to 54.1 percent, and the percentage of children receiving the third dose of diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough) and tetanus vaccine (DPT3) to 81 percent.  While the Agency met its target for DPT3 and increased coverage for SBA, it did not achieve the target of increasing SBA coverage by 1 percent every year.  While USAID devotes significant resources to ensuring universal coverage and high quality care to all mothers and children, the difficulty in achieving higher coverage of skilled birth attendance cannot be underestimated, given the significant challenges of sufficiently training and maintaining critical staff, as well as supporting health facilities and systems. </p>
<p>Another major component of EPCMD is ensuring access to family planning contraceptives.  By enabling women and couples to practice healthy timing and spacing of pregnancies and providing family planning commodities, family planning could reduce maternal deaths by 30 percent and child deaths by 25 percent globally.  USAID’s Family Planning/Reproductive Health 24 priority countries align with EPCMD countries, including: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Haiti, India, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, Rwanda, Senegal, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Yemen, and Zambia.  The average use of modern contraceptives in these priority countries increased by 1.4 percent in FY 2016 (exceeding the target of 1 percentage point by 40 percent).  Use of modern contraceptives is a high impact intervention, which reduces unintended pregnancies and abortion rates.  Similarly, in FY 2016 quarter four (Q4), USAID again exceeded its target by delivering 94 percent of purchased contraceptive commodities on time (4 percentage points above the target).  Timely delivery of commodities was due to proactive measures taken by the Agency to prevent delays.</p>
<p>As a result of USAID’s support to malaria programs and coordination with other major donors including the Global Fund, the World Bank, and UNICEF, 17 of the 19 President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI) focus countries in Africa show significant declines, ranging from 8 percent to 67 percent, in all-cause mortality rates among children under five years of age.  The support for insecticide treated nets scale-up alone resulted in over 72 million people protected in FY 2015.  While results are not yet available for FY 2016, USAID continues to support malaria programs in coordination with other major donors, including the Global Fund, the World Bank, and UNICEF, to ensure hundreds of millions of people benefit from protective measures and diagnosis and treatment for malaria.</p>
<p>USAID continues to employ data-driven decision-making to sharpen programming; USAID’s annual review of Mission Health Implementation Plans (HIPs), strategic plans for use of FY 2016 funds, is underway.  The HIP review process this year successfully ensured that programs, budgets, and implementing mechanisms were aligned with Agency health priorities and supported state-of-the-art, evidence-based programs.  The reviews assessed whether Mission and headquarter interventions optimally address the key drivers of morbidity and mortality, with clear linkages to evidence-based national or regional strategies.  In addition, reviews focused on how operating units work with partner governments, regional organizations, other donors and partners to leverage resources, ensure sustainability, and build country ownership.  As a result, USAID is well positioned to accelerate sustainable reductions in child and maternal mortality.</p>
<p>Finally, USAID uses integrated management to address complex health issues, analyzing trends in global health data, and working with missions across the world to monitor performance and apply strategic planning, core program analytics, and other pertinent information to reaffirm a multidisciplinary and cross-sectoral approach toward USAID’s priority health goals.  The Bureau for Global Health continues to monitor over 100 indicators across more than 60 countries.  In addition, Technical Officers across the Bureau for Global Health worked with missions, and their partners, to utilize results, identify gaps and address technical assistance needs.</p>
<p><em>Explanation of Results</em></p>
<p>Ending preventable child and maternal deaths requires a health service delivery system that provides high quality, equitable, and sustainable essential services to women, newborns, and children.  USAID’s equity-focused approach prioritizes services for the poorest and the most marginalized.  Work in health governance that equips local governments to effectively plan, manage, and finance high-quality maternal and child services and commodities supports this approach.</p>
<p>The procurement and shipment of family planning commodities is central to USAID’s efforts to address the unmet need for family planning in USAID-supported countries.  USAID advances and supports family planning/reproductive health programs worldwide through:  field-driven program design and implementation, efficient service and commodity delivery, comprehensive technical support, timely and authoritative research, global leadership, and high-impact partnerships.</p>
<p>In FY 2016 Q4, despite a transition from the USAID | DELIVER Project to the Global Health Supply Chain - Procurement and Supply Management Program, on- time shipments again exceeded the target value.  USAID achieved this by taking proactive measures to prevent delays in delivering contraceptive shipments to missions and programs.  In addition to utilizing FY 2016 Q3 improvements in global supply chain operation, USAID also enacted weekly transition management meetings and consistently followed up with programs to mitigate impact to the field.</p>
<p><em>Challenges and Opportunities</em></p>
<p>USAID continues to address bottlenecks and identify challenges that impact results so that it can ensure family planning commodities continue to be available where needed.  In the delivery of family planning commodities, pre-clearance, custom clearance and manufacturing delays vary from country to country and can affect the timely shipment of procurements.  Overcoming these obstacles involves working closely with other USAID projects, missions, and partner country governments; the introduction of new in-country clearance agents better equipped to manage the clearance process; a change in the shipping lane assignment; and adjustment of the order lead times for procurement planning purposes. </p>

            <div>
                <p>Milestones:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 quarter one:  <strong>Approve Annual Malaria Operational Plans for the 19 priority President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) countries</strong></strong> <strong>and 1 subregion</strong><strong><strong>. </strong></strong></li>
<li>Context: PMI Malaria Operational Plans (MOPs) are detailed one year implementation plans for PMI focus countries. The USG Global Malaria Coordinator formally approved all 20 MOPs during the Interagency Advisory Group meeting on October 14, 2015. </li>
<li>Complete: The MOPs was formally approved by the USG Global Malaria Coordinator during the Interagency Advisory Group meeting on October 14, 2015. </li>
<li><strong>FY 2016 quarter two:  Review country performance results. </strong></li>
<li>Context: USAID conducted a holistic review of our Performance Plan and Report (PPR) results against our health goals across our Field Missions and evaluated operational and management processes to ensure optimal program implementation and overall impacts of USAID-funded programs as well as collaborations with international donors, bilateral partners and public-private partnerships. USAID augmented its review of country performance results through data and success stories across maternal, child and newborn health, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, population and reproductive health, nutrition, malaria and neglected tropical diseases. </li>
<li>Complete: The review fortified USAID’s current approach while highlighting opportunities for innovation, science, technology and partnerships toward achieving our goal of ending preventable child and maternal deaths. The review resulted in concrete recommendations for future data collection and use by the Bureau and across USAID activities for future management and performance monitoring.</li>
<li><strong>FY 2016 quarter three:  Release Acting on the Call Report.</strong>                             </li>
<li>Context:  USAID's 2014 Acting on the Call Report formulated country-specific plans for working with partners in 24 priority countries to save the lives of mothers and children. The follow-on 2015 Acting on the Call Report provided country-by-country progress updates with new recommendations for reaching 38 million women with increased access to high-quality health services.                           </li>
<li>Complete:  The 2016 Acting on the Call Report further outlines how, with a new emphasis on equitable access to health services, USAID and partners can save the lives of eight million women and children in the bottom two wealth quintiles by 2020.</li>
<li><strong>FY 2016 quarter four:  Review Health Implementation Plans for the 24 USG priority countries.<strong>                                                                                            </strong></strong></li>
<li>Context: The Health Implementation Plan is the health portion of an Operating Unit's Operational Plan and is composed of four sections:  (1) A Health Key Issue narrative; (2) Implementing Mechanism (IM) narratives for those IMs receiving health funds; (3) Operational Plan budget tables for Global Health Program Account and Economic Support Fund Account (where applicable) funds; and (4) optional supporting documentation. The Bureau reviews HIPs to ensure that programs, budgets, and IMs are optimally aligned with Agency health priorities, support state-of-the-art, evidence-based programs, bring to bear the Agency’s technical expertise, and share best practices from the field.  </li>
<li>Complete:  The GH Bureau's Health Implementation Plan review process this year successfully ensured that programs, budgets, and implementing mechanisms were aligned with Agency health priorities and supported state-of-the-art, evidence-based programs.  The reviews assessed whether mission and headquarters interventions optimally address the key drivers of morbidity and mortality, with clear linkages to evidence-based national or regional strategies.  In addition, reviews focused on how operating units work with partner governments, regional organizations, other donors and partners to leverage resources, ensure sustainability, and build country ownership.  As a result, USAID is well-positioned to accelerate sustainable reductions in child and maternal mortality. </li>

                                <p><p>An estimated 85 percent of all deaths from malaria occur in children under five. In malaria-endemic areas, 50 million women will become pregnant each year.  These women are highly susceptible to the consequences of malaria, which lead to increased maternal death, severe maternal anemia, low birth weight, and infant death. In FY 2014, USAID’s malaria projects supported the Presidential Malaria Initiative’s (PMI) continued efforts to support the scale-up of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), indoor residual spraying (IRS), appropriate malaria case management including parasitological diagnosis and treatment with artemisinin-based combination therapies, and intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy.  PMI includes 19 focus countries in Africa and one regional program in the Greater Mekong sub-region.  USAID also supports malaria control activities in three other countries in Africa (Burkina Faso, Burundi, and South Sudan), as well as a regional program in Latin America.</p>
<p>If used properly, ITNs are one of the best ways to prevent mosquitoes from biting individuals and infecting them with malaria.  During the past eight years, household ownership of at least one ITN increased from an average of 29 percent to 60 percent in all 19 PMI-focus countries.  Additionally, use of an ITN among children under five more than doubled from an average of 18 percent to 46 percent, and similar increases have been documented for use of ITNs by pregnant women (from an average of 17 percent to 43 percent).</p>
<p>Measuring the number of people protected against malaria with an ITN distributed with PMI funds is a key indicator as to whether U.S. assistance is succeeding in extending prevention measures that are necessary to reach the goal of reducing the number of malaria deaths in 19 African countries.  The expected impact of ITNs is to reduce the number of malaria deaths in PMI countries.  Targets for this indicator are set by estimating the number of ITNs that will be distributed with PMI funds based on Malaria Operational Plans for the 19 PMI-focus countries.  Funding levels and the addition of countries are also considered.</p>

In malaria-endemic areas, 50 million women will become pregnant each year.  These women are highly susceptible to the consequences of malaria, which lead to increased maternal death, severe maternal anemia, low birth weight, and infant death. In FY 2014, USAID’s malaria projects supported the Presidential Malaria Initiative’s (PMI) continued efforts to support the scale-up of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), indoor residual spraying (IRS), appropriate malaria case management including parasitological diagnosis and treatment with artemisinin-based combination therapies, and intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy.  PMI includes 19 focus countries in Africa and one regional program in the Greater Mekong sub-region.  USAID also supports malaria control activities in three other countries in Africa (Burkina Faso, Burundi, and South Sudan), as well as a regional program in Latin America.</p>
<p>If used properly, ITNs are one of the best ways to prevent mosquitoes from biting individuals and infecting them with malaria.  During the past eight years, household ownership of at least one ITN increased from an average of 29 percent to 60 percent in all 19 PMI-focus countries.  Additionally, use of an ITN among children under five more than doubled from an average of 18 percent to 46 percent, and similar increases have been documented for use of ITNs by pregnant women (from an average of 17 percent to 43 percent).</p>
<p>Measuring the number of people protected against malaria with an ITN distributed with PMI funds is a key indicator as to whether U.S. assistance is succeeding in extending prevention measures that are necessary to reach the goal of reducing the number of malaria deaths in 19 African countries.  The expected impact of ITNs is to reduce the number of malaria deaths in PMI countries.  Targets for this indicator are set by estimating the number of ITNs that will be distributed with PMI funds based on Malaria Operational Plans for the 19 PMI-focus countries.  Funding levels and the addition of countries are also considered.</p>

Universal coverage in DPT3 coverage across 24 USAID-assisted countries increased in FY 2014 to 74.5 percent. Limited increments in future year targets are due to the challenge in the 24 USAID priority countries of reaching an entirely new birth cohort with all routinely recommended vaccines each year. The data source for this indicator has changed. Some of the difference between 2013 and 2014 values is attributed to the change in data source alone. While DPT3 is an indicator with robust history, harmonization efforts by USAID and global partners have led USAID to use the UNICEF/World Health Organization  database as the primary source for DPT3 coverage. While this source serves as USAID’s best metric, progress, data collection, and quality are in a continual process of assessment and refinement to adjust for recall bias, administration of mass campaigns in countries with variable reporting systems, and random error.

<p>Proven preventive and curative interventions are often packaged together to target the leading causes of death of children under five (e.g., pneumonia, diarrhea, malaria and undernutrition). More than 40 percent of all child deaths now occur in the neonatal period; in many countries, reduction of neonatal mortality is progressing more slowly than reduction of child mortality.

                                <p><p>The procurement and shipment of family planning commodities is central to USAID’s efforts to address the unmet need for family planning in USAID-supported countries.  USAID advances and supports family planning/reproductive health programs worldwide through: field-driven program design and implementation; comprehensive technical support; timely and authoritative research; global leadership; and high-impact partnerships.</p>
<p>The availability of contraceptive products and related supplies is a critical determinant of the success of any family planning program. This indicator measures the ability of USAID and its contraceptive commodity procurement contractors to deliver the supply of contraceptive products in country according to the procurement plan. In the delivery of family planning commodities, pre-clearance, customs clearance and manufacturing delays vary from country to country and can affect the timely shipment of procurements.  Delays in shipments can cause stock-outs at health facilities, which prevents women and couples from being able to access, and use, family planning commodities. </p>
<p>This indicator measures contraceptive commodity shipments made to the following countries:  Afghanistan, Angola, Bangladesh, Benin, Burundi, Dominican Republic, Ethiopia, Georgia, Ghana, Guinea, Haiti, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Rwanda, Saint Vincent, Senegal, South Africa, South Sudan, Suriname, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Trinidad and Tobago, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. This indicator is calculated as the cumulative commodities shipped and delivered each quarter as a proportion of the known orders for the year at the time, across all appropriate countries noting that the needs of countries (and therefore the number of countries) may vary quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.  Shipments included are those requested by USAID missions through the Central Contraceptive Procurement program.</p>

</div>                                <div class='data-items'><span>Indicator Overview:</span> <p>The procurement and shipment of family planning commodities is central to USAID’s efforts to address the unmet need for family planning in USAID-supported countries.  USAID advances and supports family planning/reproductive health programs worldwide through: field-driven program design and implementation; comprehensive technical support; timely and authoritative research; global leadership; and high-impact partnerships.</p>
<p>The availability of contraceptive products and related supplies is a critical determinant of the success of any family planning program. This indicator measures the ability of USAID and its contraceptive commodity procurement contractors to deliver the supply of contraceptive products in country according to the procurement plan. In the delivery of family planning commodities, pre-clearance, customs clearance and manufacturing delays vary from country to country and can affect the timely shipment of procurements.  Delays in shipments can cause stock-outs at health facilities, which prevents women and couples from being able to access, and use, family planning commodities. </p>
<p>This indicator measures contraceptive commodity shipments made to the following countries:  Afghanistan, Angola, Bangladesh, Benin, Burundi, Dominican Republic, Ethiopia, Georgia, Ghana, Guinea, Haiti, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Rwanda, Saint Vincent, Senegal, South Africa, South Sudan, Suriname, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Trinidad and Tobago, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. This indicator is calculated as the cumulative commodities shipped and delivered each quarter as a proportion of the known orders for the year at the time, across all appropriate countries noting that the needs of countries (and therefore the number of countries) may vary quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.  Shipments included are those requested by USAID missions through the Central Contraceptive Procurement program.</p>

                                <p><p>Family planning is a critically important and cost-effective response to the serious public health issues of child and maternal mortality.  By enabling women and couples to practice healthy timing and spacing of pregnancies, family planning could reduce maternal deaths by 30 percent and child deaths by 25 percent globally.  In addition, family planning is a necessary intervention for achievement of the Agency’s goal to eliminate extreme poverty.  USAID’s family planning program contributes directly to one of the priority goals of the U.S. Government – ending preventable child and maternal deaths.</p>
<p>Increased contraceptive use leads to decreases in unintended pregnancies. mCPR measures the percentage of married women of reproductive age (15-49 years) using, or whose partner is using, a modern method of contraception at the time of the survey.  Modern contraceptive methods can include: voluntary female sterilization, voluntary male sterilization, oral contraceptives, intrauterine device (IUD), injectables, implants, female condom, male condom, diaphragm, contraceptive foam or contraceptive jelly, monthly pill, country-specific modern methods, cervical cap, contraceptive sponge, and others. </p>
<p>From 2011-2015, the Bureau for Global Health has calculated the aggregated average for the following 24 priority countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Haiti, India, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, Rwanda, Senegal, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Yemen, and Zambia. FY 2016/2017 targets have been projected using Demographic and Reproductive Health Survey data for the following 32 USAID-assisted countries:  Afghanistan, Angola, Bangladesh, Benin, Burundi, Cambodia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guatemala, Guinea, Haiti, India, Jordan,  Kenya,  Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan,  Philippines, Rwanda, Senegal, South Sudan, Tanzania, , Uganda, Yemen, Zambia and Zimbabwe. FY 2015 results and FY 2016/2017 targets are based on the number of countries receiving  more than  $2 million in family planning/reproductive health funding in FY 2014 and with two or more Reproductive Health Survey , Multi Indicator Cluster Survey, or Demographic Health Survey data points available at the time of reporting. South Sudan has been included since it meets the funding criterion but only has one survey data point. </p>

<p>Increased contraceptive use leads to decreases in unintended pregnancies. mCPR measures the percentage of married women of reproductive age (15-49 years) using, or whose partner is using, a modern method of contraception at the time of the survey.  Modern contraceptive methods can include: voluntary female sterilization, voluntary male sterilization, oral contraceptives, intrauterine device (IUD), injectables, implants, female condom, male condom, diaphragm, contraceptive foam or contraceptive jelly, monthly pill, country-specific modern methods, cervical cap, contraceptive sponge, and others. </p>
<p>From 2011-2015, the Bureau for Global Health has calculated the aggregated average for the following 24 priority countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Haiti, India, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, Rwanda, Senegal, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Yemen, and Zambia. FY 2016/2017 targets have been projected using Demographic and Reproductive Health Survey data for the following 32 USAID-assisted countries:  Afghanistan, Angola, Bangladesh, Benin, Burundi, Cambodia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guatemala, Guinea, Haiti, India, Jordan,  Kenya,  Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan,  Philippines, Rwanda, Senegal, South Sudan, Tanzania, , Uganda, Yemen, Zambia and Zimbabwe. FY 2015 results and FY 2016/2017 targets are based on the number of countries receiving  more than  $2 million in family planning/reproductive health funding in FY 2014 and with two or more Reproductive Health Survey , Multi Indicator Cluster Survey, or Demographic Health Survey data points available at the time of reporting. South Sudan has been included since it meets the funding criterion but only has one survey data point. </p>

                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>We will strengthen America’s foreign policy impact as we work independently and with our partners to build a new stability in the Middle East and North Africa.  Success in this endeavor is essential to U.S. global interests and is linked to other pressing challenges and opportunities for U.S. national security:  preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon remains a top priority; terrorist groups active in the region continue to seek the capability to attack our allies, interests, and homeland; the region’s strategic energy supplies are essential to support the global economy; and regional stability and Middle East peace efforts are vital for the security of Israel and our other friends in the region.</p>
<p>Recent events have again demonstrated the need to look beyond traditional security concerns and consider the full range of issues that affect and contribute to regional stability.  A new regional stability will be built on the premise that increased democracy with respect for the rights of all citizens of a country, including minorities, will benefit both the region and the United States.  Regional stability must be built on a foundation of responsive and accountable governance, inclusive economic growth, and rights-respecting and capable security institutions.</p>
<p>The crisis in Syria embodies these complex challenges.  The Asad regime has violently defied the Syrian people’s demands for reform, and the regime’s brutality has destabilized the region through its partnership with Iran and the regime’s increasing reliance upon Hizballah.  Neighboring states, including Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, and Iraq, struggle to cope with vast refugee flows, spillover violence, and, in the case of Lebanon, serious threats to political stability.</p>
<p><strong>Strategies for Achieving the Objective</strong></p>
<p>The United States will build regional stability by working toward a comprehensive Middle East peace; forging strong partnerships to address regional threats; supporting economic growth and prosperity; and promoting democratic governance and political reforms, among other measures.</p>
<p><strong>Working towards a comprehensive Middle East Peace between Israel and the Palestinians, and Israel and its neighbors:</strong></p>
<p>The United States is committed to a just, lasting, and comprehensive peace in the Middle East, central to which is a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  We define comprehensive peace as peace between Israel and a future Palestinian state, as well as between Israel and its neighbors.  With the resumption of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations in July 2013, Middle East peace efforts now focus on the conclusion and full implementation of a final status agreement and the realization of the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative, which promises normalization of relations between Israel and Arab League states in the context of a comprehensive peace.  Should the efforts of the United States and the international community succeed in a two-state resolution to the conflict, U.S. assistance will remain critical in building Palestinian governance capacity and implementing an agreement.  Comprehensive peace also will require Israel and a Palestinian state to normalize political and economic relations with the region. </p>
<p>The United States is building strong partnerships to address regional security threats.  The United States will work with international partners to ensure that Syrian chemical weapons are removed and eliminated and that Syria complies with the Chemical Weapons Convention, UN Security Council resolutions, and Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons requirements.  We will continue to deliver humanitarian assistance to affected communities inside Syria and in neighboring countries, and to work to achieve a negotiated political solution that ends the violence in Syria and begins a political transition.  The United States will continue our unwavering commitment to Israel's security.</p>
<p>Egypt continues to face economic and political instability, while Jordan struggles to handle an influx of refugees from Syria even as it simultaneously addresses dire economic challenges, including an energy crisis.  </p>
<p><strong>Build strong partnerships to address regional security threats: </strong></p>
<p>U.S. strategic partnerships, globally and within the region, enhance our security efforts on counterterrorism and nonproliferation.  We will continue to work with the P5+1 (the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Russia, and China, facilitated by the European Union), the broader international community, and international organizations like the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to ensure that Iran complies with its obligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), and relevant UN Security Council resolutions.</p>
<p>Building upon the work at the NATO Summit in Wales, Jeddah Conference, and U.N. General Assembly meetings in September 2014, we will continue to strengthen the global coalition formed to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) through humanitarian and security assistance to partner countries in the region threatened by ISIL.  This also includes coordinating broad efforts to counter terrorist financing the flow of foreign fighters within and through the region.</p>
<p>The United States seeks to achieve a comprehensive agreement that fully resolves the international community’s concerns with Iran’s nuclear program.  Syria’s accession to the Chemical Weapons Convention was a major accomplishment.  In cooperation with like-minded international partners, we have dismantled one of the largest remaining chemical weapons arsenals in the world and eliminated those weapons as a strategic threat to Israel.  We will continue to work to achieve a negotiated solution that ends the violence in Syria and begins a political transition. </p>
<p>In addition, U.S. security cooperation and assistance to our partners will cover all aspects of counterterrorism, including legal frameworks and rights-respecting security approaches.  We will undertake efforts to prevent and mitigate extremism, sectarian conflicts, and mass atrocities; and we will counter Iran's destabilizing activities in the region.  We will also emphasize our work with states undergoing democratic transitions to assist them in establishing the capacity to provide a stable and rights-respecting domestic security environment.</p>
<p>The Syrian regime could resist a negotiated settlement to its current situation.  Terrorist organizations may take advantage of regional instability, fragile security environments in transition countries, and ongoing conflicts to launch attacks.  Governments backsliding on democratic transitions could further endanger long-term regional stability.  We must continue to undermine the violent extremist narrative by encouraging states to establish democratic and accountable institutions thereby supporting our needs to advance our broader regional security priorities.</p>
<p><strong>Promote economic growth, job creation, open markets, and energy security</strong>:</p>
<p>The United States will address economic marginalization through the promotion of economic growth, job creation, open markets, and energy security.  Economic growth and inclusive prosperity fueled by private sector development, increased investment, and inclusive employment are fundamental to regional stability and to counter the terrorist narrative.  The free flow of energy resources to the global economy is critical to promoting economic prosperity.  Sound regulatory, economic, education, and health policies are needed for enduring private sector expansion and stable employment.  Achieving these goals requires coordination with partners to design and implement reforms.  We will need to partner with governments and the private sector in the region as they develop economic incentives, protect critical infrastructure, and achieve local backing for reforms.  We will support implementation of projects that increase access to finance for small and medium enterprises.  We will encourage sound fiscal and economic policies and improved regulation to attract private investment and spur growth.  We also will support development of improved regulatory and rules-based markets to attract foreign investors to the region, including U.S. businesses.</p>
<p>Setbacks to the global economic recovery, particularly in European markets, could have negative effects in the region.  Regional conflicts, security deterioration, and increased acts of terrorism would deter investment, undermine growth, and threaten energy supplies.  The influx of Syrian refugees into neighboring countries could have a crippling effect on the respective country’s financial stability.  We will work to sustain the positive synergies and mutual reinforcement between security, democratic political reforms, and economic growth.</p>
<p><strong>Promote improved, democratic governance, empowered and effective civil society, and respect for the rule of law and human rights:</strong></p>
<p>The United States will continue to support democratic governance, civil society, and respect for the rule of law and human rights.  Responsive, inclusive, and accountable governance serves as the strongest foundation for long-term regional stability.  Governments and societies that are more inclusive, equitable, and representative are better positioned to address challenges and to partner with the United States.  We will, therefore, promote government institutions that are democratic, responsive to citizens, respect minority rights, and deliver public services transparently and equitably; legislatures that represent constituent interests; and expanded opportunities for meaningful political participation by all citizens.  Many civil society groups in the region lack capacity.  We will support the development of civil society that is effective, empowered, and able to interact constructively with government.  And we will work to strengthen and improve legal systems and weak government institutions in the region, expand access to justice, promote greater respect for human rights, and empower women, minorities, and other marginalized groups.</p>
<p>Factors beyond the U.S. government's control may affect our efforts in the region.  The Syrian regime could resist a negotiated settlement to the conflict.  Terrorist organizations may take advantage of regional instability, fragile security environments in transition countries, and ongoing conflicts to launch attacks.  Governments rejecting or backsliding on reform could further endanger long-term regional stability.  Other factors that may affect our efforts include setbacks to the global economic recovery, particularly in European markets, that could have negative effects in the region.  Regional conflicts, security deterioration, and increased acts of terrorism could deter investment, undermine growth, and threaten energy supplies.  The influx of Syrian refugees into neighboring countries also places added financial costs and demands on the infrastructure in hosting communities, as well as on social services, such as education and health care.</p>
<p>Countries in the region face serious challenges, including stagnant growth and lack of economic opportunity; internal and cross-border conflicts and associated refugee flows; resource scarcity; religious and ethnic tension and discrimination; and a demographic youth bulge.  We are convinced that responsive and accountable governments are more capable of addressing those challenges, and are committed to use our engagement, influence, and assistance to help address them.</p>

                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>The United States “rebalance” to the Asia-Pacific reflects the recognition that the future security and prosperity of our nation will be significantly defined by events and developments in that region.  The United States must enhance and deepen its strategic engagement and leadership role to influence and benefit from a rising Asia-Pacific.  At a time when the region is building a more mature security and economic architecture to promote stability and prosperity, sustained, active U.S. engagement is essential.  U.S. leadership will help strengthen that architecture and pay dividends for our security and prosperity well into this century.  The U.S. goal in the Asia-Pacific is to establish a stable security environment, an open and transparent economic environment, and a political environment that respects universal rights and freedoms.  Our efforts will yield benefits for the region and increase the economic prosperity and security of the United States.</p>
<p>Maintaining peace and security across the Asia-Pacific is central to global progress, whether through halting North Korea’s proliferation activities, defending freedom of navigation and managing growing tensions over territorial disputes, or ensuring transparency in the region’s military activities.  Supporting trade liberalization and economic development in the region stands at the center of American economic and strategic interests, and is a key U.S. priority.  U.S. economic vitality depends, in part, on the extent to which our private sector can access the opportunities offered by the Asia-Pacific’s growing consumer base.  Open markets in the region provide the United States unprecedented opportunities for commercial engagement and expansion of  trade and investment ties.  Adherence to our nation’s values – in particular, our steadfast support for democracy and human rights – greatly enhances our credibility, stature, and authority.  Strengthening and deepening people-to-people ties across the region underpins the goals of the rebalance.</p>
<p>While the Asia-Pacific is widely recognized as a region of economic dynamism, it is also home to 29 percent of the world’s poor and the site of 60 percent of the globe’s natural disasters.  Many countries in the region face challenges associated with weak institutions, inadequate rule of law, and rising inequality.  The United States seeks to help our partners in the region ensure that, as economies grow, the benefits of this growth are shared by those who are most in need.</p>
<p><strong>Strategies for Achieving the Objective</strong></p>
<p>The United States has strong and historic strategic ties and trade linkages with the Asia-Pacific, which is home to the world’s fastest growing economies.  Treaty alliances with Australia, Japan, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, and Thailand form the cornerstone of our strategic position in the Asia-Pacific.  To meet transnational threats of terrorism, violent extremism, cybercrime, and nuclear, chemical, and biological proliferation, the United States supports Asia-Pacific partners as they adopt internationally recognized legal and policy frameworks, and build their capacity to deter and mitigate these pressing threats.  In cooperation with the Department of Defense and other national security agencies, our diplomats and programs help maintain peace and security across the Asia-Pacific through efforts to achieve verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, halt North Korea's proliferation activities, maintain freedom of navigation, discourage aggressive acts, and promote increased transparency in military activities.</p>
<p>The United States’ comprehensive economic agenda for the region combines expansion of trade and investment with greater regional economic integration.  U.S. trade and investment ties with the Asia-Pacific region underpin the nation's prosperity and influence across the region.  The United States is promoting development of a rules-based regional economic and trade framework that provides an open and fair commercial environment.  Concluding the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement, the centerpiece of our economic strategy in the region, is the most important step we can take to advance prosperity in the Asia-Pacific. The TPP, with 12 members uniting Asia and the Western Hemisphere across the Pacific Rim, will foster economic growth and facilitate regional economic integration as membership expands.  In collaboration with other U.S. government agencies and the private sector, the Department will also build on past successes within the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum to foster trade and investment liberalization and strengthen regional economic integration, including initiatives on climate change and environmental protection, disaster resiliency, and health security.  The Department of State is conducting sustained diplomatic efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions among Asia’s biggest economies.  We will increase U.S. development assistance to foster trade ties, entrepreneurial activity, cleaner and more secure energy, food security, and economic empowerment of women in the region.  Continued U.S. support for Taiwan maintains peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, underpins economic and commercial relations with our 10<sup>th</sup> largest trading partner, and reinforces U.S. support for democracy and human rights. </p>
<p>The United States is modernizing its treaty alliances to provide the flexibility to effectively respond to traditional and non-traditional security challenges.  The United States seeks to strengthen partner capabilities and policies to address shared challenges and to bolster a rules-based order that operates in accordance with international laws, norms, and standards. Strengthened partnerships with Burma, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam contribute to regional stability and prosperity.  A cooperative partnership with China will strengthen U.S. national security, promote trade and economic growth, and help address transnational challenges.  The United States’ engagement with Burma supports and encourages its political and economic reforms and national reconciliation. Mongolia, New Zealand, and Pacific Island countries are important partners through their contributions to peacekeeping activities, UN votes, and efforts that align with our international economic and security priorities.  People-to-people activities, including continued outreach to international exchange alumni, play a critical role in building support within these countries for sustained partnerships with the United States.</p>
<p>The United States engages regional institutions and groupings such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the ASEAN Regional Forum, East Asia Summit, APEC, Lower Mekong Initiative (LMI), and the Pacific Islands Forum to reinforce our bilateral relationships and advance our economic, political, and security interests with regional allies and partners.  U.S. engagement with these bodies helps them establish and implement rules and norms consistent with the international norms that promote peace and stability, spur greater economic growth, and enable the region to respond more effectively to security threats and manage crises.</p>
<p>Across the Asia-Pacific, the United States is promoting democratic practices and improved governance, quality health and education, food security, strengthened disaster preparedness/emergency response, and improved environmental stewardship.  Democratic development will contribute to greater civilian security, stability, and prosperity and stronger ties throughout the region.  Strong democratic institutions and responsive governments provide the framework that paves the way for solid economic growth, improved health outcomes, greater food security, quality education, strengthened emergency response, adaptability to climate change, and stronger livelihoods overall.</p>

                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>Despite the worldwide reduction of deaths from armed conflict since the end of the Cold War, more than 1.5 billion people live in fragile or conflict-affected states or countries trapped in cycles of violence.  Fragility and conflict impede development and undermine U.S. interests worldwide.  When states in crisis cannot control their territory, protect their people, or support economic growth, the resulting instability disrupts the people’s well-being and fosters environments ripe for violent extremists, armed factions, weapons proliferation, and crime.  Fragile countries are especially vulnerable to shocks, such as natural disasters and economic crises, and their spillover effects.  Complex emergencies may arise that put demands on scarce humanitarian assistance resources.</p>
<p>The U.S. government leads the international community in responding to crises, conflicts, and natural disasters.  An estimated 45 million people worldwide, primarily women and children, have been uprooted from their homes due to conflict and persecution.  Each year, natural disasters displace tens of millions more and climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of events such as hurricanes and drought.  U.S. humanitarian assistance aims to save lives, alleviate suffering, and minimize the costs of conflict, crises, disasters, and displacement.  This requires that the United States respond urgently to emergencies, and make concerted efforts to address hunger, resolve protracted humanitarian situations, and build the capacity to prevent and mitigate the effects of conflict and disasters.</p>
<p>Most natural disasters such as drought or floods cannot be prevented.  However, the U.S. government aims to enhance the resilience of countries so that they can respond and recover as quickly as possible.  Strengthening resilience enables our humanitarian assistance to start the rebuilding and transition to long-term political, economic, and social investments that will consolidate and protect future development gains.</p>
<p><strong>Strategies for Achieving the Objective</strong></p>
<p>The United States will convene stakeholders, marginalize spoilers, and catalyze local efforts aimed at preventing and responding to crisis and conflict.  U.S. diplomacy will support peace and reconciliation efforts at the national, regional, and local levels; and it will encourage parties to negotiate solutions, to manage peaceful transitions, and to hold accountable perpetrators of mass atrocities.  To strengthen fragile states, U.S. diplomacy and development will promote inclusive economic growth, job creation, and the sound policies needed for sustainable private sector expansion and stable employment.  The U.S. will direct resources to support local initiatives and to build the capacity of civil society actors so they can successfully advocate for peaceful change.  The U.S. National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security (NAP) demonstrates that integrating women and gender considerations into peacebuilding processes promotes democratic governance and long-term stability.  As such, we will strengthen women's rights, leadership, and substantive participation in peace processes, conflict prevention, peacebuilding, transitional processes, and decision-making institutions in conflict-affected settings. Finally, we will multiply the impact of our efforts by engaging the UN and partner governments, and will strengthen partnerships with the private sector and experts outside of government.</p>
<p>The United States will expand and improve U.S. government activities that lead to effective strategies, policies, diplomacy, and development programs that avoid negative impacts ("Do no harm") on conflict dynamics, and create the potential to manage and mitigate sources of violent conflict.  The United States will promote learning agendas, and share lessons learned and best practices. And through interagency collaboration, policy development, enhanced professional training, and evaluation, the United States will institutionalize a gender-sensitive approach to our diplomatic and development activities in conflict-affected environments.</p>
<p>UN peacekeeping operations represent the international collective will to promote peace and reconciliation.  The United States will continue as the largest financial contributor to UN peacekeeping operations. The United States will use its contributions to promote effective operations, including strengthening mandates to address the needs and vulnerabilities of women and children in conflict and post-conflict zones.  The United States will also continue to support regional and sub-regional organizations and their member states as they seek to provide a cost-effective regional capacity for conflict management and crisis response.</p>
<p>The U.S. government will support country transitions out of fragility and political instability by fostering more inclusive, responsive, accountable, and democratic institutions.  The United States will support and strengthen institutions, especially those relating to safety and justice, to manage and mitigate sources of violent conflict, including gender-based violence.  The United States will support civil society actors that advocate and work toward greater civilian security.</p>
<p>The U.S. government will advocate policies and norms that prevent violence and protect vulnerable populations.  The United States will press to strengthen norms concerning the protection of civilians, to prevent, mitigate, and redress mass atrocities, to prevent and respond to gender-based violence, and to empower women's participation in political transitions and peace processes.</p>
<p>The U.S. government will provide needs-based humanitarian assistance through flexible and timely funding for persons affected by crises, conflicts, and natural disasters.  Through collaboration with other donors and host countries, the United States will find solutions to displacement, promote disaster risk reduction and climate</p>
<p>change adaptation, and will foster resilience. In line with the NAP, the United States will respond to the needs of women and children in conflict-affected disasters and crises, including by providing safe, equitable access to humanitarian assistance.</p>
<p>The U.S. government will promote rapid and well-planned humanitarian responses through support to the United Nations, Red Cross organizations, and Non-governmental organizations; mobilize and partner with other donors and host governments; and engage the international humanitarian community to maximize the effectiveness of humanitarian aid.</p>
<p>Factors beyond U.S. government control that may affect our efforts include shocks to the global economic system; political, social, or economic instability; long-standing ethnic, religious or other societal group tensions; sovereignty issues that lead governments to restrict humanitarian operations within their borders; reluctance of foreign partners to share information, regulations on protection of national security information, and privacy concerns; and natural disasters and extreme weather.  Factors the United States seeks to influence include endemic or institutionalized corruption; inadequate or nonexistent control of borders and sovereign territory; actors (state and non-state) with violent and/or destabilizing agendas; weak or dysfunctional national, regional, or local civil and military institutions; mismatches between the span of transnational criminal activity and the applicability of national laws and enforcement systems; partners' resources, capabilities, quality of their laws, and strength of their judicial/legal institutions; insufficient institutional capacity for economic development, environmental regulation and oversight; persistent gender inequality and gender-based violence; and allies and/or partners' views on the need to act on security issues.</p>

                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>Today, the United States faces diverse and complex security challenges.  Hostile nation states, violent extremists, transnational organized crime, unaccountable or abusive governance, weak rule of law, and inter- and intra-state conflict all affect civilian security, international stability and prosperity, and directly threaten U.S. interests and foreign policy objectives.  To meet these challenges, we must secure the world’s most dangerous weapons and material; prevent the rise of criminal and insurgent groups; mitigate the effects of transnational crime; dismantle al-Qa’ida, its affiliates and adherents, and other terrorist organizations and deny them new recruits; strengthen rule of law globally; counter threats posed in cyberspace; reaffirm and support the balance between individual rights and collective security; and empower women to play an equal role in solving global security problems.</p>
<p>Many of today’s threats cannot be solved by a single state, making U.S. global leadership and multilateral cooperation ever more crucial.  This objective encompasses our efforts to counter violent extremism and build the counterterrorism capacities of partner nations’ law enforcement entities, and promote regional peace and security through our diplomatic engagement and security assistance to partner nations.</p>
<p><strong>Strategies for Achieving the Objective</strong></p>
<p>In order to overcome these global security challenges, the Department of State and USAID will advance the Security Sector Assistance Presidential Policy Directive (PPD-23), helping partner countries build and sustain the capacity and effectiveness of institutions to provide security, safety, and justice for their people, and to contribute to efforts that address common security challenges.  The Department and USAID efforts include pursuit of arms control and nonproliferation; reduction of transnational organized crime and strengthening rule of law (ROL); countering the drivers of recruitment and radicalization to violence; and securing cyberspace.  The Department and USAID will cooperate with other federal agencies and international coalitions; foreign governments and their security and justice services, and multilateral organizations.  Our strategy also entails cooperation with state and local partners and civil society.</p>
<p>The Department and USAID will balance assistance appropriately, supporting governments when interests converge and political will is present, when governments are accountable to their people and are committed to partnering with civil society for change, and as a check on abuse.  To counter violent extremism, the United States will focus on the drivers of violent extremism.</p>

<p>U.S. investments that result in healthier people make for stronger, more prosperous, and more stable countries; they enhance international security and trade; and they ensure a safer, more resilient America.  Despite successes in addressing health challenges in recent decades, in some places progress remains far too slow.  Much remains to be done to strengthen health systems in developing countries and address HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and maternal and child mortality.  In 2012, 6.6 million children under the age of five died, many from preventable causes.  Infectious, life-threatening diseases such as pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria are exacerbated by malnutrition and poor access to health services.  Infectious disease outbreaks, whether naturally caused, intentionally produced, or accidentally released, remain among the foremost dangers to human health and the global economy.  Many countries have limited capacity to prevent, detect, and rapidly respond to these threats.</p>
<p><strong>Strategies for Achieving the Objective</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. government has more than 10 years of experience in helping countries to rapidly expand HIV prevention, treatment, and care services through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). PEPFAR's current strategy, PEPFAR 3.0 - Controlling the Epidemic: Delivering on the Promise of an AIDS-Free Generation, showcases PEPFAR’s design to support the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)ambitious 90-90-90 global goals: 90 percent of all people living with HIV will know their HIV status; 90 percent of all people with diagnosed HIV infection will receive sustained antiretroviral therapy; and 90 percent of all people receiving antiretroviral therapy will have viral suppression by 2020.  This new focus requires a shift in business practices, pivoting to a data-driven approach that strategically targets geographical areas and populations where we can achieve the most impact for our investments.  The PEPFAR 3.0 strategy makes clear that the United States' commitment to this goal will remain strong, comprehensive, and driven by science. Importantly, this framework emphasizes impact, efficiency, sustainability, partnership, and human rights as core agendas to create an AIDS-free generation.</p>
<p>In 2012, the U.S. government joined more than 175 countries and 400 civil society and faith organizations in pledging to end preventable child deaths worldwide by 2035, as part of the Call to Action for Child Survival.  The Call to Action joins related efforts that have set ambitious goals to end preventable maternal and newborn deaths, increase access to voluntary family planning, and accelerate improvements in malaria, nutrition, and water and sanitation.  These renewed efforts have spurred strategic shifts in maternal and child health programming including:  increasing efforts in those countries with the largest share of under-five deaths, focusing on reaching the most underserved populations, targeting the drivers of mortality through innovation and scalable interventions, and creating mutual accountability at all levels.</p>
<p>The Ebola outbreak in West Africa is a jarring reminder of the need for a greater capability in all countries to rapidly detect and respond to new or re-emerging public health threats that “spill over” in humans from animal populations.  The Global Health Security agenda is an effort between the U.S. government, other nations, international organizations and public and private stakeholders, to accelerate progress toward a world safe and secure from infectious disease threats and to promote global health security as an international security priority.  The State Department, along with other U.S. government agencies, contributes to global health security by strengthening policies related to dual-use research of concern.</p>
<p>The U.S. government will use its influence in multilateral and bilateral arenas to focus attention on accelerating achievement of U.S. global health objectives and the UN Millennium Development Goals. Continued diplomatic leadership on global health in the UN Post-2015 Development Agenda will remain a U.S. priority.  Supported by the State Department and USAID, our diplomats and development professionals will promote country-owned health systems and encourage shared responsibility for financing health systems with partner governments, other donors, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector.  Although U.S. positions on health in the Post-2015 Development Agenda have yet to be finalized, they will likely include a focus on creating an AIDS-free generation and ending preventable child and maternal deaths.  The U.S. government is also considering incorporating new areas such as non-communicable diseases and a multi-sectoral focus on health system strengthening in the Post-2015 development goals.</p>
<p>Many external factors affect U.S. government efforts on country ownership and shared responsibility.  A successful transition to country ownership depends on political stewardship by partner governments and the administrative and technical capabilities of numerous public and private institutions.  Fiscal pressures on traditional donor countries will likely continue to negatively affect their ability to support multilateral initiatives. Steady economic growth in many regions, and particularly in Africa, will create opportunities for countries to direct more domestic resources toward their health sectors.</p>
<p>The U.S. government, through the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005 and newly-signed Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2014, is committed to using its foreign assistance resources to help people and countries have reliable and sustainable access to an acceptable quantity and quality of water to meet their needs.  USAID supports increased access to reliable and sustainable water supply and sanitation through funding for infrastructure development and through institutional and capacity development, strengthening of community-based systems, facilitation of private supply of products and services, improved management and governance, and mobilization of additional financing. </p>

Over the past two decades, there has been a nearly 50 percent reduction in maternal deaths, from 543,000 in 1990 to 287,000 in 2010. Meanwhile, the annual number of under-five deaths declined from 12.6 million in 1990 to 6.6 million in 2012. While under-five mortality is declining faster now than in the past two decades, with the annual rate of reduction more than tripling in 2005-2012 compared to the rate in 1990-1995, 18,000 children still die every day. The U.S. cannot act alone and in order to meet the Millennium Development Goal Four (Reduce Child Mortality) target by its agreed date of 2015, an additional 3.5 million children's lives above the current trend rate will need to be saved between 2013 and 2015.</p>
