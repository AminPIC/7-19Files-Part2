                      <p>The SBA made substantial progress toward its Priority Goal in 2015 by adding 292 new 7(a) lenders to its network.  While the SBA did not meet its FY 2015 target, the 7(a) loan program increased by 23 percent from FY 2014, leading to a record year of approvals in volume and dollars.  Bank mergers have impacted the number of active lending partners providing the number of 7(a) loans.  This goal continued to help expand SBA’s footprint to increase small business access to capital.  In addition, significant progress continued to be made streamlining and simplifying the loan application process, decreasing processing time, and lowering costs to participants.  The number of jobs supported from 7(a) loans, 504 loans, microloans, and surety bond guaranties has increased since 2010 with the FY 2015 results showing nearly 729,000 jobs supported.</p>

</p>
                                                      <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>Providing access to capital has been one of the SBA’s critical strategies in meeting its objective to drive business formation, job growth, and economic expansion particularly in underserved markets since the Agency’s creation in 1953. By providing loan guarantees to reduce lenders’ loss exposure, the SBA provides an important credit lifeline to small businesses, especially startup businesses and businesses owned by women, minorities, veterans and other underserved groups that often cannot easily obtain credit in the  conventional market.  SBA loan programs are necessary to ensure that small businesses are not only surviving but also leading the way toward US economic expansion and growth.</p>
<p>The <strong>7(a) Loan</strong> program is the federal government’s primary small business loan program, assisting small businesses to obtain financing when they do not qualify for or otherwise have access to traditional credit.  The SBA guarantees a portion of each loan (typically 50 to 90%) that participating lenders make by using the adjusted credit standards of the 7(a) loan program.</p>
<p>SBA's FY 2014-2015 Priority Goal to increase new and returning 7(a) lenders has reduced the decline from FY 2012 to FY 2014.  SBA will continue to support small business access to capital by increasing the number of lenders participating in the flagship 7(a) loan program (including the Community Advantage pilot program). Lender participation is essential to growth in the quantity of loans approved and small businesses assisted. Attaining a high volume of lender participation will create a consistent pipeline of SBA loans to small businesses.</p>
<p>This Priority Goal directly supports SBA’s <a href="http://www.performance.gov/content/expand-access-capital">Strategic Objective 1.1</a> – Expand access to capital through SBA’s extensive lending network.  Access to capital is critical to the long-term success of America’s small businesses.  The top priority at the SBA is to get lending flowing to small businesses.</p>
<p>Key barriers and challenges:</p>
<ul><li>Economic Trends; micro- and macro-economic that impact whether banks want to provide SBA-backed loans such as:
<ul><li>Lender may not have the technology in  place to support migration to SBA systems</li>
<li>Some industries may have a high default rate and a risk that would not allow a lender to underwrite a SBA backed loan</li>
<li>Lender located in an area where some industries are effected by geographic factors that would make a risk (for example, Northeast Area has a big fishing industry that depends on weather, availability of product, regulations, etc.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bank mergers impact the number of lending partners providing 7(a) loan</li>
<li>Program awareness of SBA products and services and a shrinking workforce in field offices which provide training</li>
</ul></p>

<p>SBA will increase small business access to capital by increasing the number of new or returning lenders in the fiscal year for the flagship 7(a) program (including the Community Advantage pilot program). New and returning lenders are a major component of SBA’s lending portfolio and are essential to growth in the quantity of loans approved and small businesses assisted. Each new or returning lender will expand SBA’s footprint and increase small business access to capital. Attaining a high volume of new and returning lenders from one fiscal year to the next will create a consistent pipeline of SBA loans into the hands of small business.</p>
<p>There are barriers and challenges to the SBA in achieving its priority goals:</p>
<ul><li>Economic Trends; micro and macro</li>
<li>Issues within the Finance Industry as a whole</li>
<li>Shrinking workforce in field offices which provide training</li>
<li>Recent cases from the OIG reviewing SBA lenders underwriting criteria have triggered a more cautious approach from some lenders with some loan guaranty types</li>

<p>Congress has mandated that small businesses receive <strong>23%</strong> of federal government prime contracting dollars, including <strong>5</strong><strong>% </strong>of prime and subcontracts to Small Disadvantage Businesses; <strong>5% </strong>of prime and subcontracts to Women-Owned Small Businesses; <strong>3% </strong>of prime and subcontracts to HUBZone Small Businesses; and <strong>3% </strong>of prime and subcontracts to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses.</p>
<p>Meeting and exceeding the federal government’s small business procurement goals continues to be an Administration priority.  Federal contracting with small businesses is a win-win.  Small businesses get the revenue they need to grow their businesses and create jobs, and the federal government gets the opportunity to work with some of America’s most innovative and nimble small businesses, often times with a direct line to the CEO.</p>

</ul><p>Small businesses are agile, innovative and affordable partners for the federal government.  Through small business contracting, the federal government acts as a catalyst for small business growth, innovation, and supports the national economic security of the nation. Congress designated SBA as the agency responsible for overseeing small business contracting across the federal government.  The SBA takes this responsibility seriously as the strongest voice for small business across the Administration.</p>
<p>Key barriers and challenges:</p>
<ul><li>The unpredictable and changing budget climate is a challenge for small businesses, and SBA is working hard to create an environment where small businesses can be successful in the federal procurement marketplace. </li>
<li>The instability and ambiguity caused by Continuing Resolutions make it difficult to agency acquisition staff to plan effectively for small business utilization.</li>
<li>Entering the federal supply chain can often be a lengthy and arduous process for many small businesses.</li>
<li>The Administration and SBA continue to increase efforts and collaboration to provide more opportunities for small businesses to compete for and win federal contracts.</li>
<li>Strategic Sourcing, Bundling, and Contracting Consolidation continue to be major concerns for small business opportunity and expansion.  While the government strives to balance affordability with opportunity, SBA engages with agencies to continue to promote broader competitive opportunities to ensure the health of the small business industrial base is not adversely affected due to strategic sourcing or consolidating requirements and to protect small business from contract bundling.</li>
</ul><p>SBA must continue to implement effective and efficient strategies to monitor the agencies’ progress, support small businesses interested in working with the government, and improve the data quality agencies use to manage their contracting activities.</p>

</p>
                                                      <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>The 8(a) Program is an essential instrument for helping socially and economically disadvantaged entrepreneurs gain access to the economic mainstream of American society. The program helps thousands of aspiring entrepreneurs to gain a foothold in government contracting.</p>
<p>8(a) firms are also provided with business development assistance and can participate in the Mentor Protégé Program to build their competitive and institutional know-how to participate in competitive acquisitions.</p>
<p>A few years ago, the 8(a) Program boasted over 9,000 certified 8(a) participants, but has declined to less than 4,700 due to the administratively burdensome application process.  Though the regulatory guidance provides the SBA approximately 90 days to process a complete application, several firms have endured delays that extend anywhere from 6 months to several years.  Further, the SBA rate of approval for applicants that complete the application process is exceptionally low, under 50%.  While over 2,000 applicants apply each year, the SBA rejects most applications as incomplete or missing documentation.  Historically, only 25% of the applicants or about 500-600 applicants per year get through the burdensome process for a final decision from the Associate Administrator of the Office of 8(a) Business Development.  The SBA’s low rate of approval has led to an industry of third party firms that charge socially and economically disadvantaged applicants anywhere from $5,000 to $75,000 to prepare the application and respond to the SBA processors.  Some of these firms are taking advantage of applicants; and regardless of the amount paid, there is no guarantee of approval because the SBA approval rate is consistently less than 50%.</p>
<p>This Priority Goal is designed to grow the 8(a) Program by improving customer service for the 8(a) applicants and reduce the unnecessary administrative burdens on applicant firms.  Growth of the program will open opportunities for socially and economically disadvantaged entrepreneurs to gain a foothold in government contracting.</p>
<p>The mission of the Office of Business Development is to execute activities authorized under Sections 8(a) and 7(j) of the Small Business Act to provide business development assistance to firms that are owned and controlled by economically and socially disadvantaged individuals. The office fulfills its mission by certifying the eligibility of prospective 8(a) business development firm participants and managing a national program that provides marketing, managerial, technical, and procurement assistance to help eligible businesses achieve their full competitive potential. The SBA will continue to work collaboratively with community development partners, credit unions, minority associations and others to tailor programs to meet their needs and ensure that SBA’s programs remain accessible to underserved communities.</p>
<p>This Priority Goal directly supports SBA’s strategic objectives:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.performance.gov/content/ensure-federal-contracting-goals-are-met-or-exceeded">Strategic Objective 1.2</a> – Ensure federal contracting goals are met or exceeded by collaborating across the federal government to expand opportunities for small businesses and strengthen the integrity of the federal contracting certification process and data.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.performance.gov/content/ensure-inclusive-entrepreneurship">Strategic Objective 2.1</a> – Ensure inclusive entrepreneurship by expanding access and opportunity to small businesses and entrepreneurs in communities where market gaps remain</li>
<li><a href="http://www.performance.gov/content/mitigate-risk-taxpayers-and-improve-oversight-across-sba-programs">Strategic Objective 3.3</a> – Mitigate risk to taxpayers and improve oversight across SBA programs</li>
</ul><p>The goals address the ongoing decline in number of 8(a) small businesses.  Through 8(a) sole source and competitive contracting opportunities, the federal government acts as a catalyst for small business growth, innovation, job creation, and supports the national economic security of the nation.</p>
<p>When a small business gets a government contract, the small business is often able to quickly create jobs and spur economic growth.  The government agency often has a “direct line” to the CEO, helping ensure that products and services are meeting or exceeding expectations and serving America’s taxpayers.</p>
<p>Key barriers and challenges:</p>
<p>Many challenges exist for growing the 8(a) program and increasing the total number of application approvals for 8(a) firms. However, the SBA is committed to make smart, bold, and customer focused changes to make the 8(a) program accessible to all firms that meet the eligibility requirements of the program.  Consistent measurement of progress and monitoring of implementation of new and streamlined procedures will be key to avoid reverting to historical trends of rejecting 50% of more of the completed applications.  Challenges include:</p>
<ul><li>Uncertainty whether competitors will respond favorably to the necessary regulatory changes that will be posted in the Federal Register to remove longstanding but unnecessary burdens on firms.  Some examples are ‘wet signatures’ and a mandatory waiting period of 12 months to reapply after being declined by the SBA regardless of the reason for the decline.</li>
<li>Potential for low employee engagement or desire for the status quo within the Office of Business Development. The staff assigned to process applications work remotely from the SBA Headquarters in Washington DC and have been trained in current processes that have proven burdensome.</li>
<li>Office of Field Operation’s Business Opportunity Specialists (BOS) who conduct the day-to-day marketing to 8(a) applicants and provide business development for 8(a) certified firms.  The BOS are assigned other priorities leaving minimal time for 8(a) business development.  The decline in access to business development creates an increase in the number of firms that are terminated each year because they do not stay connected to the SBA and do not meet program requirements for annual reviews.</li>
</ul><p>The SBA programs that contribute to this Agency Priority Goal are: Size Standards, Mentor-Protégé, 8(a) Business Development, 7(j) Technical Assistance.</p>

<p>Meeting and exceeding the federal government’s small business procurement goals continues to be an Administration priority.  Federal contracting with small businesses is a win-win.  Small businesses get the revenue they need to grow their businesses and create jobs, and the federal government gets the opportunity to work with some of America’s most innovative and nimble small businesses, often times with a direct line to the CEO.</p>
<p>In FY 2012, the federal government made real progress toward the 23 percent goal, with 22.25 percent or $89.9 billion in federal contracting dollars going to small businesses compared to 21.65 percent in FY 2011, with significant impact in key areas:</p>
<ul><li>For the first time, more agencies than ever before met or surpassed all of their prime contracting goals.</li>
<li>Also, for the first time, the federal government exceeded the goal for service disabled veterans.</li>
<li>The federal government had the highest percentage of contracts going to Small Disadvantage Businesses to date.</li>
</ul><p>As a result of a government wide focus on increasing small business contracting opportunities, during President Obama’s first term (FY2009 - FY2012) the federal government awarded $376.2 billion in federal contracting dollars to small businesses.  This is a $48.1 billion increase over the four preceding years even as we have seen reduced spending overall.</p>
<p>Also, since President Obama took office, the SBA has supported more than $132.61 billion in Federal government contracting dollars to small disadvantaged businesses. This represents a 36.6 percent increase when compared to the prior Administration. Under the Bush Administration’s first term, $97.10 billion in federal government contracting dollars were awarded to small disadvantaged businesses.</p>
<p>Although we have seen marked success over the last few years, we know more must be done.  Many challenges exist for small businesses seeking to enter the federal procurement marketplace.</p>
<ul><li>The unpredictable and changing budget climate is a challenge for small businesses, and SBA is working hard to create an environment where small businesses can be successful in the federal procurement marketplace.</li>
<li>The instability and ambiguity caused by Continuing Resolutions make it difficult to agency acquisition staff to plan effectively for small business utilization.</li>
<li>Entering the federal supply chain can often be a lengthy and arduous process for many small businesses.</li>
</ul><p>SBA’s GCBD unit must implement effective and efficient strategies to monitor the agencies’ progress to goal, support small businesses interested in working with the government and encourage agencies to improve data quality when reporting their contracting activities.  SBA will increase its efforts to collaborate with and hold federal agencies accountable to achieving their goals.</p>

</p>
                                                      <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>The priority goal is directly tied to the objective of both the National Export Initiative (NEI) and the Export Promotion Cabinet (EPC) to expand SME access to trade financing, which has been identified as a gap issue for smaller exporters.  Increasing access to export financing, combined with trade counseling and training, will contribute to the enhanced ability of current and future U.S. small business exporters to succeed in the global marketplace and supports the cross-agency goal of doubling U.S. exports.</p>
<p> There are barriers and challenges to the SBA in achieving its priority goals:</p>
<ul><li>From a marketing perspective, communicating and disseminating trade financing information to lenders and small business exporters could provide challenging given current, and anticipated, budget constraints on staffing.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Inter-agency collaboration and joint initiatives can be challenging to manage, given the differing regulations and performance metrics of individual agencies, which might reduce the commitment of other agencies to help support this priority.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Unique, and sometimes additional, Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) requirements for core export loans vs. other 7(a) loan products can confuse lenders and may require the creation of “Lender Training Manuals,” more extensive lender training, and Office of Capital Access support in implementing needed SOP revisions.</li>
</ul><ul><li>In terms of operations, a reduced travel budget could greatly restrict the ability of field staff to deliver the necessary training to lenders and businesses that would expand the use of SBA loan programs for exporters, given that SBA's specialized trade finance specialists cover multiple states.</li>
</ul><ul><li>The banking sector could receive another “financial shock,” forcing it to tighten lending requirements to small businesses and/or Basel III capital requirements could limit lending capacity.*</li>
</ul><ul><li> U.S. export growth could slow, reducing demand for trade financing, as a result of slow overseas economic growth and/or a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, making U.S. exports less competitive.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>Trade financing historically has been perceived by many lenders, especially community banks, as being too complex to be incorporated into their suite of financial products. Working with other federal agencies, SBA will help reduce the complexity of USG trade financing and export marketing programs and highlight the growing importance of exports to the U.S. economy, thereby encouraging more lenders to offer comprehensive business solutions to their export customers.  In addition, SBA will leverage its outreach by working with state, federal, and other resource partners in order to promote customized trade financing options to the small business exporting community.</p>

</p>
                                                      <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>The priority goal is directly tied to the objective of both the National Export Initiative (NEI) and the Export Promotion Cabinet (EPC) to expand SME access to trade financing, which has been identified as a gap issue for smaller exporters.  Increasing access to export financing, combined with trade counseling and training, will contribute to the enhanced ability of current and future U.S. small business exporters to succeed in the global marketplace and supports the cross-agency goal of doubling U.S. exports.</p>
<p> There are barriers and challenges to the SBA in achieving its priority goals:</p>
<ul><li>From a marketing perspective, communicating and disseminating trade financing information to lenders and small business exporters could provide challenging given current, and anticipated, budget constraints on staffing.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Inter-agency collaboration and joint initiatives can be challenging to manage, given the differing regulations and performance metrics of individual agencies, which might reduce the commitment of other agencies to help support this priority.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Unique, and sometimes additional, Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) requirements for core export loans vs. other 7(a) loan products can confuse lenders and may require the creation of “Lender Training Manuals,” more extensive lender training, and Office of Capital Access support in implementing needed SOP revisions.</li>
</ul><ul><li>In terms of operations, a reduced travel budget could greatly restrict the ability of field staff to deliver the necessary training to lenders and businesses that would expand the use of SBA loan programs for exporters, given that SBA's specialized trade finance specialists cover multiple states.</li>
</ul><ul><li>The banking sector could receive another “financial shock,” forcing it to tighten lending requirements to small businesses and/or Basel III capital requirements could limit lending capacity.*</li>
</ul><ul><li> U.S. export growth could slow, reducing demand for trade financing, as a result of slow overseas economic growth and/or a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, making U.S. exports less competitive.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>Trade financing historically has been perceived by many lenders, especially community banks, as being too complex to be incorporated into their suite of financial products. Working with other federal agencies, SBA will help reduce the complexity of USG trade financing and export marketing programs and highlight the growing importance of exports to the U.S. economy, thereby encouraging more lenders to offer comprehensive business solutions to their export customers.  In addition, SBA will leverage its outreach by working with state, federal, and other resource partners in order to promote customized trade financing options to the small business exporting community.</p>

The primary opportunity being addressed is that a higher application return rate should result in a greater number of disaster survivors that will apply for disaster loan assistance and receive much needed Federal disaster assistance. SBA’s plan to increase the application return rate also ensures that SBA's disaster assistance resources for businesses, non-profit organizations, homeowners, and renters can be deployed quickly, effectively and efficiently in order to preserve jobs and help return small businesses to operation.</p>
<p>SBA’s plan to increase the application return rate will indirectly make the Disaster Loan Program more efficient by: 1) saving costs on mailing application packets to 100% of disaster survivors referred to SBA; and 2) freeing up resources dedicated to preparing and mailing application packets that can be utilized in other critical areas of the application screening process that directly impact processing times.</p>

<p>Meeting and exceeding the federal government’s small business procurement goals continues to be an Administration priority.  Federal contracting with small businesses is a win-win.  Small businesses get the revenue they need to grow their businesses and create jobs, and the federal government gets the opportunity to work with some of America’s most innovative and nimble small businesses, often times with a direct line to the CEO.</p>
<p>In FY 2012, the federal government made real progress toward the 23 percent goal, with 22.25 percent or $89.9 billion in federal contracting dollars going to small businesses compared to 21.65 percent in FY 2011, with significant impact in key areas:</p>
<ul><li>For the first time, more agencies than ever before met or surpassed all of their prime contracting goals.</li>
<li>Also, for the first time, the federal government exceeded the goal for service disabled veterans.</li>
<li>The federal government had the highest percentage of contracts going to Small Disadvantage Businesses to date.</li>
</ul><p>As a result of a government wide focus on increasing small business contracting opportunities, during President Obama’s first term (FY2009 - FY2012) the federal government awarded $376.2 billion in federal contracting dollars to small businesses.  This is a $48.1 billion increase over the four preceding years even as we have seen reduced spending overall.</p>
<p>Also, since President Obama took office, the SBA has supported more than $132.61 billion in Federal government contracting dollars to small disadvantaged businesses. This represents a 36.6 percent increase when compared to the prior Administration. Under the Bush Administration’s first term, $97.10 billion in federal government contracting dollars were awarded to small disadvantaged businesses.</p>
<p>Although we have seen marked success over the last few years, we know more must be done.  Many challenges exist for small businesses seeking to enter the federal procurement marketplace.</p>
<ul><li>The unpredictable and changing budget climate is a challenge for small businesses, and SBA is working hard to create an environment where small businesses can be successful in the federal procurement marketplace.</li>
<li>The instability and ambiguity caused by Continuing Resolutions make it difficult to agency acquisition staff to plan effectively for small business utilization.</li>
<li>Entering the federal supply chain can often be a lengthy and arduous process for many small businesses.</li>
</ul><p>SBA’s GCBD unit must implement effective and efficient strategies to monitor the agencies’ progress to goal, support small businesses interested in working with the government and encourage agencies to improve data quality when reporting their contracting activities.  SBA will increase its efforts to collaborate with and hold federal agencies accountable to achieving their goals.</p>

<p>Trade financing historically has been perceived by many lenders, especially community banks, as being too complex to be incorporated into their suite of financial products.

<p>SBA will increase small business access to capital by increasing the number of new or returning lenders in the fiscal year for the flagship 7(a) program (including the Community Advantage pilot program). New and returning lenders are a major component of SBA’s lending portfolio and are essential to growth in the quantity of loans approved and small businesses assisted. Each new or returning lender will expand SBA’s footprint and increase small business access to capital. Attaining a high volume of new and returning lenders from one fiscal year to the next will create a consistent pipeline of SBA loans into the hands of small business.</p>
<p>There are barriers and challenges to the SBA in achieving its priority goals:</p>
<ul><li>Economic Trends; micro and macro</li>
<li>Issues within the Finance Industry as a whole</li>
<li>Shrinking workforce in field offices which provide training</li>
<li>Recent cases from the OIG reviewing SBA lenders underwriting criteria have triggered a more cautious approach from some lenders with some loan guaranty types</li>

</p>
                                          <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>Congress has mandated that small businesses receive <strong>23%</strong> of federal government prime contracting dollars, including <strong>5</strong><strong>% </strong>of prime and subcontracts to Small Disadvantage Businesses; <strong>5% </strong>of prime and subcontracts to Women-Owned Small Businesses; <strong>3% </strong>of prime and subcontracts to HUBZone Small Businesses; and <strong>3% </strong>of prime and subcontracts to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses</p>
<p>Meeting and exceeding the federal government’s small business procurement goals continues to be an Administration priority.  Federal contracting with small businesses is a win-win.  Small businesses get the revenue they need to grow their businesses and create jobs, and the federal government gets the opportunity to work with some of America’s most innovative and nimble small businesses, often times with a direct line to the CEO.</p>
<p>In FY 2012, the federal government made real progress toward the 23 percent goal, with 22.25 percent or $89.9 billion in federal contracting dollars going to small businesses compared to 21.65 percent in FY 2011, with significant impact in key areas:</p>
<ul><li>For the first time, more agencies than ever before met or surpassed all of their prime contracting goals.</li>
<li>Also, for the first time, the federal government exceeded the goal for service disabled veterans.</li>
<li>The federal government had the highest percentage of contracts going to Small Disadvantage Businesses to date.</li>
</ul><p>As a result of a government wide focus on increasing small business contracting opportunities, during President Obama’s first term (FY2009 - FY2012) the federal government awarded $376.2 billion in federal contracting dollars to small businesses.  This is a $48.1 billion increase over the four preceding years even as we have seen reduced spending overall.</p>
<p>Also, since President Obama took office, the SBA has supported more than $132.61 billion in Federal government contracting dollars to small disadvantaged businesses. This represents a 36.6 percent increase when compared to the prior Administration. Under the Bush Administration’s first term, $97.10 billion in federal government contracting dollars were awarded to small disadvantaged businesses.</p>
<p>Although we have seen marked success over the last few years, we know more must be done.  Many challenges exist for small businesses seeking to enter the federal procurement marketplace.</p>
<ul><li>The unpredictable and changing budget climate is a challenge for small businesses, and SBA is working hard to create an environment where small businesses can be successful in the federal procurement marketplace.</li>
<li>The instability and ambiguity caused by Continuing Resolutions make it difficult to agency acquisition staff to plan effectively for small business utilization.</li>
<li>Entering the federal supply chain can often be a lengthy and arduous process for many small businesses.</li>
</ul><p>SBA’s GCBD unit must implement effective and efficient strategies to monitor the agencies’ progress to goal, support small businesses interested in working with the government and encourage agencies to improve data quality when reporting their contracting activities.  SBA will increase its efforts to collaborate with and hold federal agencies accountable to achieving their goals.</p>

The primary opportunity being addressed is that a higher application return rate should result in a greater number of disaster survivors that will apply for disaster loan assistance and receive much needed Federal disaster assistance. SBA’s plan to increase the application return rate also ensures that SBA's disaster assistance resources for businesses, non-profit organizations, homeowners, and renters can be deployed quickly, effectively and efficiently in order to preserve jobs and help return small businesses to operation.</p>
<p>SBA’s plan to increase the application return rate will indirectly make the Disaster Loan Program more efficient by: 1) saving costs on mailing application packets to 100% of disaster survivors referred to SBA; and 2) freeing up resources dedicated to preparing and mailing application packets that can be utilized in other critical areas of the application screening process that directly impact processing times.</p>

</p>
                          <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>Providing access to capital has been one of the SBA’s critical strategies in meeting its objective to drive business formation, job growth, and economic expansion particularly in underserved markets since the Agency’s creation in 1953.

<p>The <strong>7(a) Loan</strong> program is the federal government’s primary small business loan program, assisting small businesses to obtain financing when they do not qualify for or otherwise have access to traditional credit.  The SBA guarantees a portion of each loan (typically 50 to 90%) that participating lenders make by using the adjusted credit standards of the 7(a) loan program.</p>
<p>SBA's FY 2014-2015 Priority Goal to increase new and returning 7(a) lenders has reduced the decline from FY 2012 to FY 2014.  SBA will continue to support small business access to capital by increasing the number of lenders participating in the flagship 7(a) loan program (including the Community Advantage pilot program). Lender participation is essential to growth in the quantity of loans approved and small businesses assisted. Attaining a high volume of lender participation will create a consistent pipeline of SBA loans to small businesses.</p>
<p>This Priority Goal directly supports SBA’s <a href="http://www.performance.gov/content/expand-access-capital">Strategic Objective 1.1</a> – Expand access to capital through SBA’s extensive lending network.  Access to capital is critical to the long-term success of America’s small businesses.  The top priority at the SBA is to get lending flowing to small businesses.</p>
<p>Key barriers and challenges:</p>
<ul><li>Economic Trends; micro- and macro-economic that impact whether banks want to provide SBA-backed loans such as:
<ul><li>Lender may not have the technology in  place to support migration to SBA systems</li>
<li>Some industries may have a high default rate and a risk that would not allow a lender to underwrite a SBA backed loan</li>
<li>Lender located in an area where some industries are effected by geographic factors that would make a risk (for example, Northeast Area has a big fishing industry that depends on weather, availability of product, regulations, etc.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bank mergers impact the number of lending partners providing 7(a) loan</li>
<li>Program awareness of SBA products and services and a shrinking workforce in field offices which provide training</li>

<p>SBA will increase small business access to capital by increasing the number of new or returning lenders in the fiscal year for the flagship 7(a) program (including the Community Advantage pilot program). New and returning lenders are a major component of SBA’s lending portfolio and are essential to growth in the quantity of loans approved and small businesses assisted. Each new or returning lender will expand SBA’s footprint and increase small business access to capital. Attaining a high volume of new and returning lenders from one fiscal year to the next will create a consistent pipeline of SBA loans into the hands of small business.</p>
<p>There are barriers and challenges to the SBA in achieving its priority goals:</p>
<ul><li>Economic Trends; micro and macro</li>
<li>Issues within the Finance Industry as a whole</li>
<li>Shrinking workforce in field offices which provide training</li>
<li>Recent cases from the OIG reviewing SBA lenders underwriting criteria have triggered a more cautious approach from some lenders with some loan guaranty types</li>
