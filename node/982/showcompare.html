                      <p><strong>Highway Research</strong></p>
<p>In 2009, FHWA launched Every Day Counts (EDC) in cooperation with AASHTO to speed up the delivery of highway projects and to address the challenges presented by limited budgets. EDC is a State-based model to identify and rapidly deploy proven but underutilized innovations to shorten the project delivery process, enhance roadway safety, reduce congestion and improve environmental sustainability. Through the EDC model, FHWA works with State and local transportation agencies and industry stakeholders to identify a new collection of innovations to champion every two years. Innovations are selected collaboratively by stakeholders, taking into consideration market readiness, impacts, benefits and ease of adoption of the innovation.  After selecting the EDC technologies for deployment, transportation leaders from across the country gather at regional summits to discuss the innovations and commit to finding opportunities to implement the solutions that best fit the needs of their state highway programs.</p>
<p>Every state transportation agency has used eight or more of the 32 innovations promoted under the initiative, and some have adopted more than 20. Several of those innovations are now mainstream practices in many states. The initiative has also fostered a transportation workforce that is adept at putting innovation to work to address transportation challenges. </p>
<p>FHWA launched an Incentive Program that offers technical assistance and funds, of up to $100,000 per State Transportation Innovation Council (STIC) per year, to support the costs of standardizing innovative practices in a State transportation agency or other public STIC stakeholder. In FY 2015, a total of $4.2 Million was awarded to 44 STICs and a FLH TIC to fund a variety of projects. For example, the Vermont Transportation Agency is using STIC Incentive funds to develop a design-build guidance document, the Utah DOT is developing a 3D utility database, and the North Carolina DOT is developing a local public agency certification program.</p>
<p>FHWA also launched the Accelerated Innovation Deployment (AID) Demonstration Program in 2014. The AID Demonstration Program provides incentive funding to offset risk of using an innovation on a project. Under this program, funds are available to implement an innovation in any aspect of highway transportation including planning, financing, operation, structures, materials, pavements, environment, and construction on any project eligible for assistance. The funding award is for the full cost of the innovation on a project up to $1 million. A total of $45 million was allocated to fund the program and, 45 awards have been issued totaling $33.8 million since the program was started.</p>
<p>The Strategic Highway Research Program 2 (SHRP2) complements the EDC and STIC initiatives. In coordination with AASHTO, FHWA is encouraging transportation agencies to field test the results of more than 100 research projects, referred to as SHRP2 Solutions, to determine if they will ultimately be adopted as standard business processes and practices. FHWA’s Implementation Assistance Program (IAP) offers financial and technical assistance to eligible State DOTs, MPOs, local transportation entities and others to help offset the costs and risks of early adoption of innovation. </p>
<p><strong>Rail Research</strong></p>
<p>FRA’s Research and Development (R&amp;D) program enables the safe, reliable, and efficient movement of people and goods through basic and applied research and development of innovations and solutions.  It does so by providing the scientific and engineering basis for safety rulemaking and enforcement.  FRA also collaborates with the railroad industry to develop and implement new technologies and practices that improve overall system safety.  R&amp;D produces long-term benefits. The work that began 5 to 10 years ago contributes to today’s safety record.</p>
<p>Recent examples of successful rail safety R&amp;D include crashworthiness research that led to improved passenger rail car safety; analysis of vehicle-track interaction that led to revised track safety and vehicle qualification standards; development of a freight train braking algorithm that enables achievement of positive train control safety benefits without adversely affecting operations; and safety culture pilot programs that have reduced the number of human factors caused accidents and incidents.</p>

By 2050, the U.S. population will likely increase by more than 100 million people. Highway and airport congestion are increasing, with related severe economic and environmental impacts. To address these challenges and strengthen the country’s competitive position in an increasingly global economy, the U.S. Department of Transportation has a comprehensive program to develop high-speed and intercity passenger rail. The Federal Railroad Administration manages an approximately $20 billion grant and loan portfolio focused on:</p>
<ul><li>Building new high-speed rail corridors that expand and fundamentally improve passenger transportation in the geographic regions they serve;</li>
<li>Upgrading existing intercity passenger rail corridors to improve reliability, speed, and frequency of existing services; and</li>
<li>Laying the groundwork, through corridor and state planning, for future high-speed rail services.</li>
</ul><p>For the High-Speed and Intercity Passenger Rail Program, FRA selected 153 projects across the country, with nearly 85 percent of rail investments concentrated in 6 corridors (San Francisco-Los Angeles, Boston-New York City-Washington, D.C., Seattle-Portland-Eugene, Charlotte-Washington, D.C., Chicago-St. Louis, and Chicago-Detroit). These corridors are in five mega-regions, in which about 65 percent of the U.S. population resides and which will likely absorb the bulk of future population growth.</p>
<p>FRA has developed a sophisticated grants management apparatus, laid the foundation for sustainable long-term passenger rail improvements, and strengthened industry capacity to deliver rail projects through technical assistance and strategic initiatives. FRA is strongly committed to robust stakeholder outreach, communication, and collaboration as central components of program management, allowing FRA to identify program improvements, engage in project planning and development, and provide the support necessary for grantees to carry out projects successfully.</p>

<p>The En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) System replaces the 40-year-old En Route HOST Computer System and backup system used at 20 FAA ARTCCs around the country.  ERAM is the main computer system air traffic controllers use to guide airplanes flying at high altitudes.  Air traffic control towers, terminal radar approach control facilities, the Air Traffic Control System Command Center, flight service stations, and other agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense, all connect to and use the information managed by the En Route HOST Computer System.  The original HOST computer software architecture was developed in the late 1960s and was implemented as National Airspace System (NAS) Stage A in the early 1970s.</p>
<p>For controllers, ERAM provides a user-friendly interface with customizable displays.  Trajectory modeling is more accurate than in HOST, allowing maximum airspace use, better conflict detection, and improved decision making.  ERAM will substantially increase the number of flights that can be tracked and displayed to controllers from 1,100 to 1,900.  The ERAM system also provides two functionally identical channels with dual redundancy, providing a more robust back-up capability than today's environment.  Coverage will also extend beyond facility boundaries, enabling controllers to handle additional traffic more efficiently because ERAM is designed to process data from up to 64 radars instead of the current 24.  The ERAM system is needed to replace the current HOST system and allow the FAA to continue to provide the high level of safe, reliable air traffic control services that the nation has come to expect; and also put in place the infrastructure necessary to transition the NAS to NextGen.</p>

</p>
                                                      <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>Background:</p>
<p>Reducing roadway fatalities continues to be a top priority at the Department of Transportation (DOT).  Roadway crashes are among the leading causes of death in the United States, especially among young people. Over the past 10 years, there has been a 25 percent reduction in the number of fatalities on the Nation’s roadways. In 2014, there were a projected 32,675 motor vehicle fatalities. This decline in fatalities shows a continuation in the general trend downward in fatalities that started in 2006.  In fact, the projected 2014 fatality rate of 1.08 per 100 vehicle million miles traveled (VMT) is the lowest ever recorded.</p>
<p>The importance of improving transportation safety is reflected in DOT’s Strategic Plan. The Department strives to make the U.S. transportation system the safest in the world. DOT will work with all of its stakeholders — transportation agencies, elected officials, law enforcement, industry, safety advocates, novice drivers, the disability and older adult communities, and the public — to reduce transportation-related fatalities and injuries and make our roadway system safe for all users.</p>
<p>Progress toward a national roadway safety goal requires collaboration with a diverse group of stakeholders and partners across a range of disciplines.  Within DOT, the relevant operating administrations can leverage the respective resources and expertise to more effectively achieve a safer transportation environment. These organizations include the following:</p>
<ul><li>Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) provides Federal State and local partners the tools, resources, and information necessary to make sound safety investment decisions and coordinates with States to develop Strategic Highway Safety Plans (SHSP) and implement programs that improve the safety of roadway infrastructure on all public roads.</li>
<li>Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) promotes safe commercial motor vehicle (CMV) (large truck and bus) operations through education, innovation, regulation, enforcement, financial assistance, partnerships, and full accountability to reduce crashes, injuries, and fatalities on our Nation’s roadways involving CMVs.</li>
<li>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) develops vehicle safety standards, conducts research on new vehicle safety and technology, and oversees compliance, defect investigations and recalls.  NHTSA equally focuses on driver behavior by developing effective traffic safety programs, providing grant funds to States to implement these programs, and implementing national high visibility enforcement campaigns.</li>
</ul><p>Roadway fatalities impact all road users, including drivers, passengers, pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclists, commercial vehicle operators, and those who work to build and maintain the Nation’s four million miles of roadways. The  Federal government is the only entity that has the authority to establish national safety standards for vehicles, regulate interstate motor carriers, and mandate roadway safety features.</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholders:</strong></p>
<p>FHWA, FMCSA, and NHTSA have formed strategic alliances with partners from a wide array of backgrounds to enhance and forward the Nation’s roadway safety agenda through guidance, technical assistance, and development of resource materials. Many stakeholders currently address transportation safety issues independently, through individual goals, plans, and activities. Some have implemented substantial safety initiatives, and these contributions are vital to maintaining and improving roadway safety. As described in the RSP, involvement by multiple stakeholders provides opportunities for broader public outreach and for the development and implementation of cross-cutting roadway safety strategies reflecting the common interests of many parties.</p>
<p>Each partner offers unique strengths and abilities to assist each mode to deliver its programs and leverage resources in protecting the public on the Nation’s roadways.  Progress toward a national roadway safety goal requires collaboration with a diverse group of stakeholders and partners across a range of disciplines.  The agencies within DOT work with a network of partner organizations, such as State Highway Safety Offices, State transportation departments, Tribal governments, local and county traffic engineers, law enforcement agencies, public health associations, safety advocacy groups, the motorcoach industry, hazardous shipping businesses, interstate trucking operations and the auto industry on the development of evidence-based roadway safety programs, projects, and safety standards.  Such collaboration will help to integrate a broad range of factors affecting roadway safety and create more efficient and effective problem-solving synergies across the transportation industry.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<p>A number of challenges could slow down or even reverse positive trends.  Many States continue to face budget shortfalls and are under tremendous pressure to reduce services, resulting in cut backs to roadway safety programs.  Cutbacks in State, Tribal and local law enforcement agency budgets could weaken national enforcement campaigns and local traffic safety enforcement efforts.  States, Tribes, and local governments must be willing to use data-driven analytical processes to make the best and most effective safety investments.</p>
<p>Distracted driving has emerged as a new threat over the past few years as the rise of portable electronic devices has swiftly expanded.   Moreover, as in-vehicle electronic systems become ever more sophisticated and complex, distracted driving could become an even greater threat if it is not addressed in a manner keeping pace with technological advancements.  In fact, a new report by the Governors' Highway Safety Association (GHSA) cites 50 percent of the US adult population now owning smartphones and the wireless industry reports a subscription penetration rate of 102.2 percent (^1).  Also, as the economy continues to gain momentum, more recreational travel and driving may lead to higher crash rates.  Additionally, safety defects in vehicles that are not addressed in a safe and efficiently manner can lead toward more serious vehicle crashes and injuries.  Finally, the repeal of proven life-saving traffic safety laws at the State level, such as universal motorcycle helmet or primary seat belt laws, could also result in higher injuries and fatalities.  Nevertheless, significant opportunities remain for continued progress in reducing roadway fatalities.  The Department will seek new and innovative ways to serve the American people and keep our roadways safe.</p>
<p>MAP-21, The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (P.L 112-141), was signed into law by President Obama on July 6, 2012.  MAP-21 provides an increase in safety funds available for the Highway Safety Improvement Program along with a focus on performance-based programming.  Implementation of MAP-21 will rely heavily on increased partnership across State agencies with DOT.  Additionally, the shift to performance-based programming may require additional effort on the part of some States.  There are also challenges associated with improving safety with local roads and local agencies with Federal-aid program funds, as well as the capacity and willingness of States to use data-driven and analytical processes to make the best safety infrastructure investments.</p>

We will advance U.S. economic interests in targeted markets abroad in order to create additional transportation-related jobs. We set standards for both the manufacture and operation of transportation products. American transport manufacturers and service providers rely on access to foreign markets through liberalized entry or operational rules and compatible technical standards. We exert extensive positive influence over international transportation development as well as to heighten U.S. competitiveness. Through the development of a National Freight Strategic Plan pursuant to MAP-21, we will also focus transportation infrastructure investments on projects that will particularly benefit U.S. exports.</p>

By 2050, the U.S. population will likely increase by more than 100 million people. Highway and airport congestion are increasing, with related severe economic and environmental impacts. To address these challenges and strengthen the country’s competitive position in an increasingly global economy, the U.S. Department of Transportation has a comprehensive program to develop high-speed and intercity passenger rail. The Federal Railroad Administration manages an approximately $20 billion grant and loan portfolio focused on:</p>
<ul><li>Building new high-speed rail corridors that expand and fundamentally improve passenger transportation in the geographic regions they serve;</li>
<li>Upgrading existing intercity passenger rail corridors to improve reliability, speed, and frequency of existing services; and</li>
<li>Laying the groundwork, through corridor and state planning, for future high-speed rail services.</li>
</ul><p>For the High-Speed and Intercity Passenger Rail Program, FRA selected 153 projects across the country, with nearly 85 percent of rail investments concentrated in 6 corridors (San Francisco-Los Angeles, Boston-New York City-Washington, D.C., Seattle-Portland-Eugene, Charlotte-Washington, D.C., Chicago-St. Louis, and Chicago-Detroit). These corridors are in five mega-regions, in which about 65 percent of the U.S. population resides and which will likely absorb the bulk of future population growth.</p>
<p>FRA has developed a sophisticated grants management apparatus, laid the foundation for sustainable long-term passenger rail improvements, and strengthened industry capacity to deliver rail projects through technical assistance and strategic initiatives. FRA is strongly committed to robust stakeholder outreach, communication, and collaboration as central components of program management, allowing FRA to identify program improvements, engage in project planning and development, and provide the support necessary for grantees to carry out projects successfully.</p>

                                          <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>Air traffic control systems can improve the efficiency of airspace. As of December 2014, ERAM achieved Initial Operation Capability at all 20 Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs).  By March 2015, all 20 Air Route Traffic Control Centers will have achieved Operational Readiness Date (ORD) for ERAM.</p>
<p>The En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) System replaces the 40-year-old En Route HOST Computer System and backup system used at 20 FAA ARTCCs around the country.  ERAM is the main computer system air traffic controllers use to guide airplanes flying at high altitudes.  Air traffic control towers, terminal radar approach control facilities, the Air Traffic Control System Command Center, flight service stations, and other agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense, all connect to and use the information managed by the En Route HOST Computer System.  The original HOST computer software architecture was developed in the late 1960s and was implemented as National Airspace System (NAS) Stage A in the early 1970s.</p>
<p>For controllers, ERAM provides a user-friendly interface with customizable displays.  Trajectory modeling is more accurate than in HOST, allowing maximum airspace use, better conflict detection, and improved decision making.  ERAM will substantially increase the number of flights that can be tracked and displayed to controllers from 1,100 to 1,900.  The ERAM system also provides two functionally identical channels with dual redundancy, providing a more robust back-up capability than today's environment.  Coverage will also extend beyond facility boundaries, enabling controllers to handle additional traffic more efficiently because ERAM is designed to process data from up to 64 radars instead of the current 24.  The ERAM system is needed to replace the current HOST system and allow the FAA to continue to provide the high level of safe, reliable air traffic control services that the nation has come to expect; and also put in place the infrastructure necessary to transition the NAS to NextGen.</p>
