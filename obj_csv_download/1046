"Social Security Administration",16,SSA,"Serve the Public through a Stronger, More Responsive Disability Program",1034,1046,"Maximize Efficiencies throughout the Disability Program",,"We remain committed to providing the best service to the public by exploring new technologies and using modern tools to improve efficiencies throughout our disability program.  We are improving the claims process, making it easier for the public to file disability applications and enabling us to process applications more efficiently.  When fully implemented, our State DDS and Federal disability case processing sites will use a common system (i.e., DCPS).  DCPS will replace all the disparate applications currently in use at the State DDSs and Federal sites, many of which are rigid, outdated, and resource intensive.  The new system will incorporate additional functionality, such as decision support tools, improved quality checks, improved MI, and compatibility with industry standards for electronic medical records.  Expanded use of health IT offers yet another opportunity to realize efficiencies in the disability process.  Among other positive effects, health IT will enable us to quickly recognize if a treating healthcare provider is also one of our health IT partners.  If a provider is a health IT partner, our systems communicate directly with the provider’s systems to request medical records, confirm the claimant or beneficiary has provided an authorization for release of information form, and return the provider’s records to us.  Health IT has the potential to increase our efficiency and lower the claimant’s wait time for a decision by giving us medical evidence within minutes rather than days or weeks.  Strategies:   	Enhance our ability to share workloads among our offices to maximize resources; 	Increase process automation; and 	Expand the use of health IT.","Office of Systems","We took the following steps in FY 2015 to maximize efficiencies throughout the disability program (see Key Initiatives and Performance Measures for more details): • Implemented Agile practices in developing the consolidated Disability Case Processing System; • Implemented the national skills-based routing system to increase field office telephone answering capability; • Implemented data analytics and predictive modeling to identify disability applicants with severe medical conditions; and • Expanded our health IT partnerships. Next Steps • Continue developing a Disability Case Processing System capable of processing all case types by the end of FY 2016 (additional enhancements planned for FY 2017); • Continue our participation in national and federal health IT policy and standards workgroups, ensuring our requirements are included; and • Continue expanding the use of health IT for disability claims processing to increase the amount of medical evidence received and the number of states with participating providers.  ","Social Security",,,
