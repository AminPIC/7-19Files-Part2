"Social Security Administration",16,SSA,"Deliver Innovative, Quality Services",1032,1056,"Partner with Other Agencies and Organizations to Improve Customers’ Experience and Align with the Administration’s One-Government Approach",,"Many of our customers seek services from and interact with other government agencies and community organizations.  We are committed to reducing the burden people face when dealing with multiple organizations to get the services they need.  To improve our ability to serve the American public, we must continue our strong relationships with other government agencies and community organizations.  We can learn from other agencies and organizations with similar programs, share data as permitted, and develop processes and procedures that are less cumbersome and more focused on the customer.  Partnering with other agencies and organizations improves the customer experience and supports the Administration’s “one-government” approach.  As part of a broader initiative to support one-stop online access to multiple government services, we will collaborate with other government agencies and community organizations to install Social Security Express kiosks (i.e., self-service computer stations offering access to our online services) at their respective facilities.  This collaboration will benefit both the customer and our agency as we anticipate cost savings from expanding our online self-service options.  We will work to increase our collaboration with the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs on the Wounded Warriors Initiative.  In this effort, we focus on improving the transfer of medical information, expediting the disability claims process, and facilitating payments to wounded service members, veterans, and their families.  Electronic sharing of medical information is a key feature of this initiative.  Strategies:   	Pending result of the pilot, implement Social Security Express to provide service using self-service kiosks in community locations; 	Provide Social Security services through other government agencies, community-based organizations, tribal governments, and private organizations that serve our customers; 	Increase collaboration with the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs to improve processes for veterans and service members; and 	Improve information sharing among other government agencies for records, data, and other information.","Office of Operations","We took the following steps in FY 2015 to improve customers’ experience through partnerships with other agencies (see Key Initiatives and Performance Measures for more details):   	Installed three additional customer service stations in the New York and Philadelphia regions, bringing the total to seven; 	Completed 4,274 transactions on our Customer Service Stations (CSS), including answering 2,102 video calls to assist customers in real time; 	Partnered with over 50 community locations to provide video service delivery; and 	Partnered with organizations affiliated with the VA and Health and Human Services to expand our Social Security Express Projects; 	Partnered with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to promote each other’s online services.  The IRS added the SSA Express icon link to 100 of its kiosks in 37 locations across the country; and 	Partnered with the Alaska Online with Libraries to provide 125 video locations across remote Alaska, areas to reduce travel time for claimants and representatives attending hearings before an administrative law judge.   Next Steps   	Evaluate the customer service station project and, if successful, obtain agreements with additional third-party sites for installation; 	Issue additional desktop icons to local government and private organizations; 	Partner with additional veterans organizations to provide access to our online services; 	Expand data exchanges with the VA and DoD; 	Determine system requirements to exchange information with the VA to receive medical information quicker; 	Increase federal data exchange partnerships from 18 federal agencies to 22 federal agencies; 	Develop and publish the types of data commonly shared among federal agencies; and 	Add links to the IRS web site on our self-help personal computers in up to 16 pilot locations.    ","Social Security",,,
