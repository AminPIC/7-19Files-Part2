"Department of Commerce",6,DOC,"Improve government, business, and community decisions and knowledge by transforming Department data capabilities and supporting a data-enabled economy.              ",570,1094,"Transform the Department’s data capacity to enhance the value, accessibility and usability of Commerce data for government, business and the public. (ESA, NOAA, NIST, NTIS)","Transform the Department’s data capacity to enhance the value, accessibility and usability of Commerce data for government, business and the public. (ESA, NOAA, NIST, NTIS)","The Department of Commerce collects, stores, and analyzes a treasure trove of data, including data on the economy, our population, and our environment.  This data is fundamental to our mission and is used for the protection of life and property and to enhance economic growth.  However, the capacity to analyze and disseminate all that data is significantly constrained.  To meet these needs, Commerce data must be accessible, useable, reliable, and comprehensive.      Barriers to accessing and using the data must be minimized in order to realize the potential value of the data Commerce collects, stores, and disseminates,.  There are differing standards, methodologies, operations, infrastructures, websites, architecture, platforms, and formats that make it difficult to access, find, use, and combine data sets.  Commerce will undertake a comprehensive effort to improve the interoperability of our own data, both through internally-adopted standards and Commerce-wide efforts to better integrate our own data and making Commerce data more accessible and usable to the public.  Consistent with privacy and security considerations, Commerce is firmly committed to unleashing its untapped data resources in ways that best support downstream information access, processing, analytics, and dissemination.        Partnering with the private sector will increase the capacity of Commerce to release raw scientific and climate data that cannot be cost-effectively disseminated by the Federal government under current resource constraints.  Public-private commitments to adhere to sets of common standards and architectures could also result in a powerful data platform that would help provide more widespread access to public data in usable forms.  However, this infrastructure and its enabling standards will only work if they are developed collaboratively between the public and private sectors, partnering with each other.  This increased openness and interoperability needs to start in house.  Commerce will undertake a comprehensive effort to improve the interoperability of our own data, both through internally–adopted standards and Commerce-wide efforts to better integrate our own data.     In sum, Commerce will lead efforts to make sure government data is accessible in ways to make our businesses more competitive, our governments smarter, and our citizens more informed.",,"The Department of Commerce (DOC), in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, has highlighted this objective as a focus area for improvement.  Data from the decennial census, the GDP, and data from NIST and NOAA research have long been principal products of the Department.  The DOC FY 2014-18 Strategic Plan changes the paradigm for Commerce data from product to competitive advantage.  Risks are inherent in this novel look at data but given the breakneck speed of Big Data revolution and the imperative of data security, transforming the Department’s data capacity must be a focus area.  The shift requires a new governance approach, new architecture, unprecedented collaboration among agencies and the private sector, and concerted efforts to project where technology will be 10-15 years from now.  These challenges are daunting and will require unwavering attention moving forward.  In FY 2014, DOC made progress toward making more of its data available to its customers.  Accomplishments include:   	Census began testing a new model for organizing data assets called the Commerce Interoperability Framework.  This model, which promises to make Commerce data easier to access and manipulate, has been jointly developed with NIST and dovetails with both the DOC FY 2014-18 Strategic Plan and OMB’s Open Data Policy Memorandum (M-13-13). 	NIST and NTIS continued to work with the private sector to explore new uses for NIST official time (e.g. http://www.nist.gov/pml/div688/grp40/new-time-stamp-service.cfm). 	NOAA worked closely with businesses and entrepreneurs to intelligently position NOAA's vast data holdings in the cloud, to be co-located with easy and affordable access to computing, storage, and advanced analytical capabilities.  Market research to gain this knowledge occurred through a series of interactions with industry throughout the year, including an initial Big Data Request for Information (RFI), which received responses from 70 companies, a Second Request for Information and Industry Day, with 200 unique organizations in attendance, and an Open Data 500 Roundtable Report. 	To ensure the right expertise and leadership to drive its data transformation, DOC began its search for a Chief Data Officer, has hired a Deputy Chief Data Officer, and announced the establishment of the Commerce Data Advisory Council.      Next Steps in FY 2015:   	FY2015Q1 – Complete draft of Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) in order to provide a means to further develop and pilot the NOAA Big Data Partnership model. 	FY2015Q2 – Appoint members to Commerce Data Advisory Council. 	FY2015Q2 – Sign CRADA with at least one partner in order to begin pilot of NOAA Big Data Partnership model. 	FY2015Q2 – Convene first meeting of Commerce Data Advisory Council in order to begin soliciting expert recommendations as to how to make Commerce data more interoperable and easier to access, combine, and manipulate. 	FY2015Q2 – Consider standing up two working groups in order to capitalize on expertise and shared experiences and to develop best practices within Commerce:  (1) an application programming interface (API) working group; and (2) a mapping tools working group. 	FY2015Q3 – Initiate first test pilot of the NOAA Big Data Partnership model with at least one dataset. 	FY2015Q4 – Expand NOAA Big Data Partnership pilot to include multiple datasets.","General Science, Space,
