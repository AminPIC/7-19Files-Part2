"Department of Commerce",6,DOC,"Foster a more innovative U.S. economyâ€”one that is better at inventing, improving, and commercializing products and technologies that lead to higher productivity and competitiveness",573,1099,"Increase the capacity of U.S. regional economies to accelerate the production of value-added goods and services by providing services to and investments in businesses and communities. (NIST, EDA, MBDA, PTO)","Increase the capacity of U.S. regional economies to accelerate the production of value-added goods and services by providing services to and investments in businesses and communities. (NIST, EDA, MBDA, PTO)","American communities must position themselves to compete in the new economy.  However, communities with significant economic challenges may not have the knowledge or network needed to leverage their assets and identify opportunities.  To understand the needs of producers and attract and expand investment, they need partners and expert guidance.  The Department assists with strategic place-based investments that help create a productive industrial ecosystem.  This support includes resources for infrastructure, planning, and technical assistance to strengthen the capacity for innovation in manufacturing.  Technical assistance funding focuses on enhancing industry-required skills and identifying international supplier opportunities for small businesses.     The Department is dedicated to helping regional economies thrive and provides grants to state and local governments and non-profits in communities and regions suffering from economic distress.  Technical and business assistance is also provided to smaller manufacturers through partnerships between federal and state governments and non-profit organizations.  Some grants and services are specifically targeted to increasing the competitiveness of minority businesses. Through this multi-pronged approach, the Department is increasing the capacity of U.S. regional economies to produce value-added goods and services, increasing their competitiveness in the modern global economy.",,"In FY2014, the Department of Commerce made good progress in supporting the development of regional capacity for advanced manufacturing economies. The Department led and participated in multi-bureau and multi-agency efforts to: support small and mid-sized manufacturing by restoring robust supply chains; strengthen community and regional capacity for advanced manufacturing; increase advanced manufacturing assistance for minority firms; and provide local resources for protecting and scaling technologies. The Department successfully expanded its footprint across the country, strengthening regional ties and providing local resources.  Accomplishments include:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                	NIST/Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) funded five Manufacturing Technology Acceleration Center (MTAC) pilot projects in 2014 to accelerate technology adoption across US supply chains.  In addition, MEP Centers are implementing a Center-developed supply chain optimization set of tools and materials focused on establishing a coaching and mentoring partnership between a MEP Center’s subject matter experts and participating manufacturers to address barriers to effective supply chains. MEP Centers help to improve supply chain performance by quantifying the needs of the supply chain and focusing on the points in the process that are impeding throughput. Total cost of ownership is one element on which the centers provide guidance, along with executive and partner engagement and risk management. 	In June 2014, NIST MEP hosted the Grantee Regional Collaboration Meeting for the 53 grantee teams from four multiagency initiatives: the Jobs and Innovation Accelerator Challenge, the Rural Jobs Accelerator, the Advanced Manufacturing Jobs and Innovation Challenge and the Make It In America Challenge. The 150 attendees included representatives from the grantee teams from the 30 states such as Workforce Investment Boards, State Economic Development Agencies, MEP Centers, Universities, non-profits, and chambers of commerce.  The two day event provided a venue for information and peer knowledge exchange on the latest practices that will accelerate cluster and industry development in urban and rural regions for small and medium sized manufacturers, worker training, job creation and business investments in the U.S. 	EDA economic development grants made during FY 14 to help communities and regions build the capacity to support advanced manufacturing are, according to recipients, estimated to create and/or retain approximately 8,000 jobs and result in $3.1B in private investment. 	EDA, in its leadership role for the Investing in Manufacturing Communities Partnership (IMCP), coordinated the process of designating the 12 Manufacturing Communities.  EDA worked with designees on follow-up activities associated with designation, including helping to identify various federal grant opportunities, and began developing metrics to track program impacts. 	NIST/MEP delivered Supply Chain Optimization services multiple times each month, embraced by more centers and training more MEP staff.  24 MEP Centers are actively promoting these services, and they have delivered more than 50 related workshops and training sessions to companies thus far. 	USPTO made progress establishing satellite offices throughout the country. It finalized a permanent Silicon Valley lease.  On June 30, 2014, USPTO held the opening ceremony for the Rocky Mountain Regional Office located in Denver, Colorado. That office welcomed its third class of patent examiners, putting it well on the path to hire a full staff of 100 by summer 2015. 	MBDA held its National Minority Enterprise Development (MED) Week Conference, the nation’s premier event for minority businesses and the public and private sectors. The 2014 National MED Week Conference offered a venue for minority-owned firms to access information, tools, and resources to grow their businesses both domestically and internationally. 	In FY 2014, 8,353 firms received in-depth technical assistance from NIST MEP centers, a steady increase from 8,140 firms in FY 2013 and 7,614 firms in FY 2012.                             Next Steps in FY 2015:                                          	Q1: EDA will complete internal and external prioritization efforts for capacity-building grants that support advanced manufacturing. 	Q1: EDA will host an IMCP Summit to showcase the 12 Manufacturing Communities, communicate best practices in economic development, and build connections between the communities, agencies, and investors. 	Q2: USPTO will make progress on two new Satellite offices: open Silicon Valley office and build permanent space for Dallas, TX office in order to enhance the USPTO regional presence in support of inventors, entrepreneurs, and small businesses. 	Q2: NIST will publish a report describing progress on all five MTAC pilot projects to promulgate best practices across MEP centers. 	Q2-4: EDA will award and administer grants that reflect advanced manufacturing priority, undertaking quarterly status reviews. 	Q3: NIST will engage newly created MEP Advisory Board Committee on Technology Acceleration actively in technology acceleration strategy during first half of 2015. Committee will develop action plan by May 2015. 	Q3: EDA will select and announce up to 12 new Manufacturing Community designees for the second round of IMCP. 	Q4: USPTO will open Dallas Satellite office.","General Science, Space, and Technology",,,
