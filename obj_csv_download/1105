In doing so, HUD aims to minimize taxpayer risk by fostering private capital as a primary source of liquidity, and focus government participation while allowing it to maintain its counter-cyclical role. The right solution will ensure continued access to home ownership and multifamily investment opportunities for creditworthy borrowers while avoiding the problem of private gains and public losses.","Office of Policy Development and Research","The housing market continued to improve in FY 2015, and HUD continues to monitor borrower composition and origination trends to ensure our target borrowers are being served. HUD initiated work on appropriate strategies for developing enhanced credit scorecards. As always, HUD continues to engage with stakeholders and policymakers to ensure potential housing finance reform legislation meets the Administration’s housing policy priorities.","Commerce and Housing Credit",,,
