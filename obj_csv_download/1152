Homeowners with seriously delinquent and underwater loans find it difficult to sell or refinance their homes. For home-buyers, tight underwriting standards (some FHA lenders impose additional requirements above those required by FHA) and high down payment requirements make it difficult to obtain a loan. These challenges have disproportionately affected first-time, minority, and low-to-moderate income home-buyers and homeowners. HUD will work to ensure that these under-served groups have the ability to access financing.","Office of Housing","FHA made great progress to ensure access to sustainable housing financing for underserved borrowers in FY 2015. Among other achievements, major sections of the new FHA Single Family Policy Handbook became effective in FY 2015 and the Supplemental Performance Metric was implemented, providing clearer guidance to lenders and providing a more comprehensive assessment of lender performance. ","Commerce and Housing Credit",,,
