"Department of Housing and Urban Development",25,HUD,"Achieving Operational Excellence",1181,1183,"Reduce the time and complexity of the clearance process","Reduce the time and complexity of the clearance process by establishing and enforcing clear protocols for drafting and reviewing documents placed in departmental clearance.","For some significant policy documents, submission of the document for departmental clearance is the first time that key HUD policy and support offices and HUD’s Office of General Counsel (OGC) review such documents. The absence of involvement of key HUD offices can result in a lengthy clearance process if major disagreements exist. There are also less significant policy documents that only need abbreviated review which go through the full clearance process unnecessarily.   To address these challenges, HUD will establish guidelines for development of significant policy  documents that include a preclearance process and protocols for clearance of these documents. HUD will also establish guidelines that will institute a significant reduction or no clearance of routine or less significant policy documents.   ","Office of the General Counsel","In FY 2015 75 percent of documents completed the clearance process by the deadline.",,,,
