"Department of Housing and Urban Development",25,HUD,"Achieving Operational Excellence",1181,1188,"Develop and foster a collaborative, value-driven workforce.","Employ, develop, and foster a collaborative, high-performing workforce that is capable of continuing to deliver HUD’s mission in a changing and uncertain future.","We will employ, develop, and foster a collaborative, values-driven, and capable workforce by focusing our efforts on: 1) promoting greater leadership effectiveness, 2) enhancing employee engagement, and 3) addressing performance results.   The Department will face a number of challenges and changes in the years ahead, as we continue to address the housing recovery during a period of fiscal constraints. Changes in housing markets and communities around the nation are speeding up, just as natural disasters and the need for rebuilding communities across America is also increasing. Meanwhile, it is estimated that 57% of HUD’s workforce will be eligible to retire by 2015. To accomplish our mission in the years ahead, we must capture the wisdom and knowledge of our current and departing technical experts and leaders and transmit it to their successors. In that regard, we must value and utilize more effectively the contributions of all our employees as vital members of our workforce and help them fulfill their professional development and career needs.   By improving leadership effectiveness, investing in employee engagement, and addressing performance challenges, we will build a more collaborative workforce, demonstrate our core values, and grow our capabilities. By fulfilling our roles as a trusted strategic partner, a human capital compliance expert, and a transactions facilitator for HUD’s employees, we can ensure that HUD’s workforce is ready to achieve its mission of creating sustainable, inclusive communities and quality, affordable homes for all.","Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer","Significant strides were made within the human capital management arena during FY 2015. OCHCO successfully completed all identified objectives: a strategic workforce and succession-planning tool was piloted; the Department-wide engagement strategy was developed and deployed leading to best in government improvements; and the Succession Plan for 2015-2018 was completed, which included direction for program offices and identification of mission-critical and high-risk/high-impact positions for development of technical and managerial competencies. HUD’s EVS Engagement index increased to 62 percent in FY 2015, up from 57 percent in FY 2014.  OCHCO also coordinated efforts agency-wide to establish engagement strategies for each office, based on EVS scores and feedback from employees and managers.",,,,
