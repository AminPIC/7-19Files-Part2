"Department of Housing and Urban Development",25,HUD,"Achieving Operational Excellence",1181,1189,"Make high-quality data available to support decision-making in furtherance of HUD's mission","Make high-quality data available to those who need it, when they need it, where they need it, to support decision-making in furtherance of HUD's mission.","HUD data can be unreliable, inaccessible, and redundant, with new systems or datasets created to address faulty data rather than fixing the original data source. Moreover, HUD has historically had a fragmented approach to technology adoption, which leads to multiple platforms and multiple services competing for resources. Finally and similarly, HUD has not achieved the right balance of contracting support and in-house expertise to manage the agency’s data and systems effectively and affordably.   Over the next four years, HUD aims to leverage these opportunities by enhancing the quality, availability, and delivery of HUD information to citizens, employees, business partners, and the government, while striving for excellence in IT management practices and governance to consolidate and streamline HUD’s systems. In pairing enhanced technology and improved processes with a developing and strengthening workforce, the department expects to vastly broaden its ability to achieve current and future departmental goals.","Office of the Chief Information Officer","The Department made strides through a data governance working group to develop a strong data governance structure working toward master data management - including the initial HUD Data Model which was published in February. We also made significant IT infrastructure progress though the implementation of Office 365, the initiation of a new mobile devices pilot, and the establishment of a new enterprise solution for Customer Relationship Management (CRM). While the number of IT systems increased by 12 from FY 2014, the cost decreased by over $22 million.",,,,
