"Department of the Interior",10,DOI,"Secure America's Energy Resources",535,1260,"Manage Conventional Energy Development","Manage conventional energy development.","The DOI oversees vast resources that, when developed the right way and in the right places, support an “all of the above” energy strategy that expands the production of energy at home, promotes energy security, and helps drive the economy and job growth.  The Department’s landscape-level approach focuses on environmentally responsible energy development.","BLM, BOEM"," The Department is modernizing practices, leveraging technology, and looking across the government and industry for best practices to improve the transparency and timeliness of the energy development permitting process, providing greater certainty to industry, and strengthening inspection and regulatory enforcement programs. While the permit-to-drill processing rate has been level at approximately 5,000 against 8,000 requests, performance can be ensured and potentially increased through modernizing the Automated Fluid Minerals Support System (AFMSS), and attaining the authority to collect higher processing fees to provide the necessary workforce. The Department is implementing onshore leasing reforms through improved Master Leasing Plans, which could ultimately help reduce conflict and litigation related to onshore leasing.  The coal lease application process poses a challenge for performance of this strategy.  Historically, the coal lease application processing has been slow, averaging 12% annual completion over the past 5 years primarily due to complex environmental documents required for lease processing, and the extensive coordination required with landowners.  FY 2015 performance for coal lease applications processed was exceeded due to receipt of only two new coal lease applications, allowing for additional time to process existing applications.  Offshore lease sales, and fluid mineral applications were processed as expected.",Energy,,,
