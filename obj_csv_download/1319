"Department of Labor",12,DOL,"Prepare workers for better jobs",583,1319,"Advance workers' rights, acceptable work conditions, and livelihoods, particularly for the world's vulnerable populations","Advance workers' rights, acceptable work conditions, and livelihoods, particularly for the world's vulnerable populations.","Preparing workers for better jobs is fundamental to enacting the Secretary’s vision of promoting and protecting opportunity. Investing in workers and empowering them to earn the skills they need to succeed in durable, sustainable careers is one way the Labor Department contributes to President Obama’s plan to rebuild the middle class. To grow the economy from the middle out, workers need the opportunity to equip themselves with the right competencies and employers need access to a skilled domestic workforce required to compete in a 21st century global economy. While the Department serves all workers, it maintains a focus on the hardest to serve populations, assuring that these groups expand their economic opportunities and do not get left behind. The Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB) protects opportunities for American businesses and workers to compete on a level playing field internationally, by working to improve worker rights and livelihoods for vulnerable populations across the globe.      ","Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB)","The Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB) supports this objective.   In FY 2015, working through grantees in 60 countries, ILAB provided education or vocational services to 48,491 children engaged in or at high risk of entering child labor (exceeding its target of 28,538 by 70 percent); helped increase capacity to address child labor in 29 countries and provided livelihood services to over 30,000 families. In addition, ILAB funded model programs to address worker rights through technical assistance and provided support to improve business compliance and technical capacity of government and to protect worker rights in 17 countries. In FY 2016, ILAB will further refine its policy performance indicator to more accurately capture the effectiveness of its work.","Education, Training, Employment, and Social Services||International Affairs",,,
