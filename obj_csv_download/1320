"Department of Justice",11,DOJ,"Prevent Terrorism and Promote the Nationâ€™s Security Consistent with the Rule of Law",554,1320,"Prevent, disrupt, and defeat terrorist operations before they occur","Prevent, disrupt, and defeat terrorist operations before they occur by integrating intelligence and law enforcement efforts to achieve a coordinated response to terrorist threats","Combating terrorism is DOJ’s top priority.  The Attorney General, acting primarily through the FBI, has principal investigative responsibility for all criminal acts of terrorism (18 U.S.C. § 2332b(f)).  A key tenet of this objective is to ensure that intelligence and law enforcement agencies are able to use all available tools to investigate vigorously and prevent acts of terrorism in a manner consistent with law.",FBI,"Strategic Objective Review Summary of Findings: On track and making satisfactory progress  Terrorism is the most significant national security threat that the United States of America faces.  As such, combating terrorism is, and will continue to be, the top priority of the Department.  The Department focuses on targeting and disrupting terrorist threats and groups by leveraging its workforce and ensuring use of the latest technology to thwart emerging trends.  In FY 2015, the Department disrupted 440 terrorist threats and groups, greatly surpassing its annual target of 125.   The Department could not have achieved its success in terrorism disruptions without operational prioritization of having talented and highly-skilled agents.  The FBI prioritized specialized training for eligible counterterrorism Task Force Officers to ensure a highly-skilled workforce, and full-time Task Force Officers have achieved a completion rate of 90 percent for counterterrorism (CT) operations training.  Innovations regarding this objective include the enhancement of FBI’s Guardian system to follow leads.  Some notable successes include the fact that expanded use of the FBI Tip Line has led to multiple leads and arrests, including the capture of AME Church shooting suspect, Dylann Roof, on June 18, 2015.  Other notable successes include the arrest of Christopher Lee Cornell in January 2015 for plotting a small arms and bombing attack on the U.S. Capitol building and nine CT arrests by the FBI and Joint Terrorism Task Forces in conjunction with the Iraq/Syria conflict.  The nature of terrorist threats continues to evolve.  The Department is committed to stopping terrorism of any kind at any stage, from thwarting those intending to conduct an act of terrorism to investigating the financiers of terrorist operations.  Some companies and foreign partners do not currently have the capabilities or tools to help track or mitigate dynamic terrorist risk areas (e.g., social media, foreign fighters, virtual currency), which increases the Department’s workload burden.  In light of this, the FBI will continue to work with public companies and foreign partners to identify candidates with the ability and resources to support intelligence integration and law enforcement efforts.  Similarly, advancements (e.g. information sharing venues and advanced encryption techniques) have increased the complexity and breadth of threats and made it difficult for the Department to keep pace with constantly changing and new technologies.  In response to the evolving nature of the terrorist threat, the Department is taking numerous actions.  The National Security Division (NSD) is ensuring that the law enforcement and intelligence community is able to make efficient use of legal authorities, including foreign intelligence information collection authorities, and is improving how we counter violent extremism, including by exploring ways to counter radicalization to violence before a crime is committed and studying alternative dispositions that may be appropriate.  Additionally, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) continues to use its Certified Explosives Specialist program to provide agents and officers a specialized skillset to execute explosives operations and risk management/safety functions; and the FBI, Criminal Division, and INTERPOL Washington continue to work with partner agencies abroad to expand capacities and share intelligence.","National Defense||Administration of Justice",462,"FY14-15 : National Security","Terrorism is the most significant national security threat that the country faces.  Accordingly, the Department’s number one priority is, and will continue to be, protecting the security of this Nation’s citizens.  The Administration has recognized that terrorism cannot be defeated by military means alone.  The Department of Justice serves at the forefront of the fight against terrorism, providing a broad spectrum of tools, resources, and skills to combat terrorists.  Specifically, the Department’s agents, analysts, and prosecutors will continue to use every available resource and appropriate tool to detect, deter, and disrupt terrorist plots, investigate and prosecute terrorists, and aid in developing rule of law programs in post-conflict countries to help prevent terrorism abroad.  The Department will aggressively pursue emerging threats around the world and at home, enhance the ability to gather and analyze actionable intelligence, and engage in outreach efforts to all communities in order to prevent terrorism before it occurs.   Cyber activities, likewise, constitute a growing threat to our national security.  As an initial matter, an increasing number of sophisticated state and non-state actors have both the desire and the capability to steal sensitive data, trade secrets, and intellectual property for military and competitive advantage.  In addition, cyber-enabled terrorism poses a viable threat to national security.   Although the United States has not yet encountered terrorist organizations using the Internet to launch a full-scale cyber-attack, the Department believes that it is a question of when, not if, they will attempt to do so.  The cyber threat demands ready and fluid means of sharing information and coordinating actions and responses.  In order to successfully investigate and disrupt cyber threats, the Department must be creative and forward-looking in its approach, considering what kinds of tools, investigations, and outreach can be launched now to lay the groundwork for future cyber protective efforts."
