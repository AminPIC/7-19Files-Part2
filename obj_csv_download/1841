"Department of State and USAID",14,DOSUSAID,"Strengthen Americaâ€™s Economic Reach and Positive Economic Impact",1840,1841,"Expand Access to Future Markets, Investment, and Trade","Expand Access to Future Markets, Investment, and Trade","In an interconnected world, America’s prosperity is closely linked with the global economy.  In 2011, the United States exported $2.1 trillion of goods and services, which supported 9.7 million American jobs.  In the Western Hemisphere alone, U.S. trade with Latin America and the Caribbean reached $1.3 trillion in 2012, with Canada and Mexico trade alone exceeding $1.5 billion per day, making Canada our top trade partner and Mexico our third largest partner.  Foreign markets – especially in developing and emerging economies – are growing more rapidly than the U.S. domestic market.  As one of the world’s most competitive and innovative economies, the United States benefits as markets open and trade barriers are lowered.  A proven way to open markets and lock in transparent trade and investment rules is through trade negotiations.  The United States has free trade agreements with 20 countries, and is actively negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.  Doubling down on our already-robust partnership with Europe and linking the eastern and western halves of the Pacific is in our economic and security interest.  Free trade agreements are only part of the story.  All around the world, State and USAID work hard to establish clear, transparent, and open markets outside of formal negotiations.  U.S. firms succeed abroad when government and private sector procurement decisions are based on commercial and technical merits, when rules and regulations are transparent and enforceable, when intellectual property rights are respected, and when foreign competitors, including state-owned enterprises, do not benefit from unfair advantages or unsustainable labor and environmental practices.  We also work through international organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), World Trade Organization (WTO), International Labor Organization (ILO), and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), and with private sector organizations.  Reaching global consensus on economic rules through these organizations minimizes the potential for barriers to trade and investment, directly benefitting U.S. companies.  Information and communications technology drives growth and prosperity in every sector of the economy.  The government and private sector partnership in this sector is essential to success.  We conduct negotiations and engage with international organizations to set agreed rules and standards, paving the way for private sector innovation and prosperity.  Our educational, technical, and scientific exchanges and collaboration also bring clear economic benefits.  They serve as a bridge between the United States and foreign countries and leaders; advance research and policy collaboration in addressing common challenges; and build respect for the United States as a meritocracy driven by knowledge and innovation.  With America’s higher education sector perched at the pinnacle of the global education market, the United States is the preferred destination for international students, making education and training our nation’s fifth largest export.  International travel supports an estimated 1.2 million U.S. jobs.  Facilitating quick, efficient, and secure travel remains an important goal of the State Department.  We facilitate over 67 million visitors traveling to the United States each year.  Travel and tourism-related goods and services accounted for $166 billion in 2012.  Efficient issuance of U.S. passports also facilitates international travel by American citizens, promoting international tourism and commerce.  Factors affecting U.S. government efforts to expand access to future markets, investment, and trade include the strength of the U.S. economy and fiscal situation, which in turn determines our leadership on global economic issues.  Another financial crisis or deep recession could trigger resurgence in protectionist sentiment worldwide, rolling back efforts to open markets.  Political instability can shock financial markets and lead to a deteriorating investment climate.  On the education front, slower growth in students’ homelands, a stronger dollar relative to local currency, and greater competition from other countries could lead to fewer students attending U.S. universities.  Successful science and technology cooperation depends on foreign partners with the right resources and expertise.  Encouraging innovation depends upon foreign governments’ commitment to policy and regulatory reform – including strong support for intellectual property rights – and making the right investments to build a knowledge economy.     Strategies for Achieving the Objective  Today’s increasingly competitive global environment compels the U.S. government to strengthen its advocacy for free, transparent, and open markets; promote equal legal and regulatory treatment for American and local compa­nies in foreign markets; expand support for U.S. compa­nies looking overseas for customers and partners; broaden access to the United States for foreign students and leading researchers; and intensify international collaboration on innovation and technology.  Our diplomatic missions are on the front-line in achieving these goals advocating for U.S. exporters, pushing to eliminate impediments for our companies, and promoting job-creating foreign direct investment in the United States.          The Department of State, together with the Departments of Commerce, Agriculture, and USAID, support the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative as it negoti­ates bilateral and multilateral trade, investment, and trans­portation agreements that reduce barriers to trade and foster a more open, transparent, inclusive, and rules-based inter­national economic environment.  Moreover, USAID and State deliver targeted trade capacity building and technical assistance to foster adoption of agreed trade and investment rules.  USAID further facilitates improvements in country trading systems and helps build capacity for trade, working with developing countries and countries in transition to identify and reduce trade and other barriers that inhibit business formation and growth.  Assistance also encompasses reforming laws and regulations, reducing compliance costs for businesses and individuals, and ensuring implementation and enforcement capacity.  The Department and USAID also promote regional economic integration as a way to reduce tensions among states, promote growth, and create larger common markets for U.S. exporters.  The Department partners with the Department of Commerce to advocate for U.S. companies bidding on foreign government tenders, to help U.S. companies find new markets for exports, to continue policies that open markets to trade and investment, and to encourage invest­ment in the United States.  The ability of U.S. companies to bid successfully on foreign government tenders is a measure of U.S. government success working with other governments to negotiate market-opening agreements and resolve regu­latory issues, and in ensuring fairness for our companies in the face of aggressive foreign competition.  U.S. industries and operators are at the forefront of infor­mation and communication technology development and innovation.  The State Department, in collaboration with the Federal Communications Commission, the Department of Commerce, other executive branch agencies, and industry, actively promotes the regulatory and policy environment necessary for market confidence and economies of scale for a global information and communications technology sector.  U.S. engagement with organizations such as the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) enables agreement on the technical standards and policies that drive this sector, facilitating scientific advancement, expansion of affordable broadband Internet access, and the evolution of wireless devices.  The Department of State promotes educational and profes­sional exchanges and links between the United States and foreign educational, non-profit, and private sectors; promotes U.S. educational exports such as study in the United States through student advising centers; and prioritizes the visa applications of students, scholars, and exchange visitors, regularly expediting appointments and maintaining short appointment queues for these priority travelers.  These efforts, and the people-to-people connections they foster, advance research and collabora­tion while building respect for the United States.  USAID assistance to strengthen foreign markets makes other countries better trade and investment partners for the United States.  USAID tailors programs for individual countries.  Some need assistance in broad-based economic policy reforms; others need help developing market-supporting institutions such as improved commercial law, industrial relations systems, trade regimes, banking structures, stock exchanges, or tax collection systems.  USAID has prioritized support for the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade Facilitation (TFA), which is aimed at streamlining borders, including enhancing technical assistance and capacity building for developing countries.  Implementation of this seminal agreement is expected to provide cost and time savings for companies trading goods regionally and internationally.  Programming will focus on reforms that boost trade by reducing costs and delays for traders, and increase the predictability, simplicity and uniformity in customs and other border procedures.  USAID is working with the private sector as an important partner in this work, involving U.S. and local business communities on public-private partnerships that expand and deepen bilateral trade and investment opportunities.  The intersection between economic growth and competitiveness, rapidly advancing technology, and the complexity of critical issues such as climate change require the Department of State and USAID to integrate traditional economic policy approaches with our support for entrepreneurship, environmental stewardship, innovation, and scientific collaboration.  Expanding international collaboration on science, technology, and knowledge-based industries, facilitating fair access to emerging markets for U.S. companies, and fostering the free flow of goods, services, and ideas, while protecting intellectual property rights, have a powerful impact on growth and innovation.  Throughout all these efforts, the Department and USAID seek to increase the positive impact of economic growth.  This means promoting gender and ethnic equality; increasing access to and defending a free, open Internet; advancing human rights and labor rights; encouraging responsible business practices; and protecting the environment.  Gender activities are guided by the Presidential Memorandum on Coordination of Policies and Programs to Promote Gender Equality and Empower Women and Girls Globally.","Under Secretary for Economic Growth, Energy and the Environment (State) and Bureau for Economic Growth, Education, and Environment (USAID)","The Departments of State and Commerce collaborated to improve the President’s National Export Initiative, launching the new version, NEI/Next.  NEI/Next is a new customer service-driven strategy with improved information resources that will ensure American businesses are fully able to capitalize on expanded opportunities to sell their goods and services abroad.  NEI/NEXT will help more American companies reach more overseas markets by improving data, providing information on specific export opportunities, working more closely with financing organizations and service providers, and collaborating with states and communities to empower local export efforts.  Progress has been demonstrated on SelectUSA, a program created at the federal level to showcase the United States as the world’s premier business location and to provide easy access to federal-level programs and services related to business investment.  SelectUSA is designed to complement the activities of our states—the primary drivers of economic development in the United States.  This effort is driving the creation of major policy conferences like the Investment Summit and the Summer Forum, taken economic development organizations (EDOs) on Road Shows throughout the world to connect them with investors, and facilitated seminars at industry trade shows in the United States and overseas.  The Department of State also demonstrates progress in Strategic Objective 1.1 with the Business Information Database System (BIDS).  BIDS is a portal built to help U.S. businesses learn about significant international commercial opportunities.  The BIDS website features an interactive map that displays descriptions and locations of projects that represent potential contract or tender opportunities for U.S. businesses.  The site also connects U.S. business to detailed information about each project as well as information to contact U.S. embassies overseas.  BIDS is an open data platform; developers can use BIDS data to support other applications including the development of websites and apps.  Over the long-term, BIDS is also designed to create an archive of projects that can be used to analyze development and procurement patterns.  In addition to responsibility for maintaining the Trade Capacity Building (TCB) Database, which serves as a primary source for TCB information for many U.S. government agencies, USAID is also the lead U.S. government agency for implementation of the TFA.  During 2015-2017, USAID will continue support for Trade Facilitation reforms with a focus on partnerships with the private sector and international like-minded donors.  Partnering with the private sector will capitalize on real world experience and insights to ensure real savings in time and cost of trade.  On another front, the Department of State is monitoring a positive trend in the number of foreign students studying in the U.S. and note progress is on track to meet goal of a 50 percent increase in high-level science and technology and innovation engagements.  In addition to these efforts, the U.S. Global Development Lab (Lab) launched in April 2014 is making strong progress to bring game-changing solutions to global scale and drive innovation.  The Lab serves as a hub and intellectual center for those focused on evidence around development impact, cost effectiveness, and scalability.   USAID, through the Lab, identified four promising innovations ready to reach millions of people:  drought and disease tolerant maize in Africa; chlorhexidine, a simple antiseptic that reduces the incidence of infant illness and death from umbilical cord infection; electronic payment systems; and real-time data systems.  These solutions, along with others being tested and scaled by universities, researchers, nongovernmental organizations, and private sector partners, via private sector routes, are on a path to reach more than five million people.  Over the next five years, the Lab is taking 10 percent of solutions in its pipeline of innovations to at least one million people each, and 10 percent of those to global scale, improving 200 million lives around the world.  The main challenge is the ambition of the Lab’s planned impact and its reliance upon collaborative partnerships to achieve targets.  In collaboration with a wide range of external actors to leverage one dollar in external funding for every one dollar in Lab investment, success depends upon an ability to create and sustain partnerships to take solutions to developing countries and communities.  The Lab’s Action Plan is to build business plans for each of the four principal solutions we will support reaching scale, and to engage USAID bureaus, missions, other U.S. government agencies, international organizations, host country counterparts, foundations, corporations, nongovernmental organizations, and other donors to join in taking these proven solutions to scale.  Additionally, the Lab will draw attention to other solutions in the innovation pipeline so that hundreds of other solutions may find paths to scale independently, for example, through private sector and nongovernmental channels.","International Affairs",,,
