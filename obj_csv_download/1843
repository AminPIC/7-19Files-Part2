(NIST, EDA, ESA, Census)","Accelerate the development of industry-led skills strategies that result in a productive workforce for employers and high-quality jobs for workers. (NIST, EDA, ESA, Census)","A skilled and adaptable workforce is critical to U.S. global competitiveness and sustainable economic growth.  An employer-aligned, (i.e., demand-driven) comprehensive approach to skills development is essential to helping businesses across all sectors better access skilled workers to grow, innovate, and be more productive.  A skills strategy focused on industry-driven solutions helps address the difficulties many industries, particularly manufacturing, have in filling jobs requiring specific technical skills—even with many Americans still looking for work.     The Department is an honest broker for business and possesses the convening power, regional economic development expertise, and supply-chain-need analytical capability to highlight and address the workforce demands of growing industries.  In addition to supporting a National Economic Council-led effort to align federal agency initiatives to better serve industry demands, the Department programs will to the creation of a   strong pipeline of workers with in-demand skills.",,"During FY 2014, the Department of Commerce (DOC) successfully undertook various efforts to reduce the gap between the workforce needs of employers and the supply of workers with in-demand skills.  By making its workforce-related data more accessible, emphasizing an ecosystem approach to workforce-related interagency coordination, and stressing the importance of aligning workforce development and economic development, DOC began to establish itself as industry’s resource for input into the Administration’s job-driven skills training agenda.                                Accomplishments include:      	The Department contributed to other federal agencies’ workforce-related funding opportunities to make sure employer expectations are considered during the development of grant opportunities. 	EDA, ESA, and NIST contributed to the interagency Job-Driven Checklist to give value to and clarify the needs of business in workforce development. 	EDA economic development grants made in FY 2014 to help communities and regions build the capacity to support job driven workforce skills are, according to recipients, estimated to create and/or retain approximately 2,900 jobs and result in $539M in private investment. 	EDA established a “job-driven skills development” investment priority and included the job-driven principles in the new Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy (CEDS) Content Guidelines to increase awareness of the importance of industry-led workforce development. 	EDA completed a draft of the Regional Partnership for Talent Development Federal Funding Opportunity (FFO) to establish a series of learning exchanges to promote regional workforce ecosystems. 	MFG Day, co-produced by NIST Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP), Fabricators and Manufacturers Association, National Association of Manufacturers, The Manufacturing Institute, along with the Science Channel and Shell Oil, showcased nation-wide activities, open houses and events to interest the public in manufacturing and the importance the industry plays in the U.S. economy. On October 3, 2014, more than 1600 events took place across the county in support of MFG day and providing manufacturers an opportunity to highlight their industry. 	NIST incorporated the Job-Driven Checklist in a funding opportunity that began a systematic re-competition of its MEP centers. 	Twelve NIST-MEP centers began pilot testing the SMARTalent tool to understand the workforce needs of client-users and is positioned to share data with local workforce stakeholders (e.g., community colleges). 	DOC, Office of Science and Technology Policy, and Department of Labor partnered with technology leaders to put better career information and career connections in the hands of today’s and tomorrow’s job seekers through a series of data jams. 	Census completed a significant redesign of the OnTheMap application reports to make it easier for users to analyze workforce data. 	The National Advisory Council on Innovation and Entrepreneurship (NACIE) was repositioned to emphasize board membership that highlights successful industry-led skills/workforce development strategies.      Next Steps in FY 2015:                                                                                                    	Q1:  DOC will convene first organizational meeting of reconstituted NACIE in order to set objectives and plans for the term of the council. 	Q1:  EDA will complete internal and external prioritization efforts for EDA capacity-building grants that support job-driven workforce skills training. 	Q1:  EDA will publish Regional Partnership for Talent Development FFO in order to identify, disseminate, and facilitate the replication of best practices in public-private partnerships to build a regional pool of workers with the skills needed by regional businesses. 	Q2:  NIST will conduct landscape review and analysis of existing data sources for cybersecurity labor market information to incorporate into the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education data resources. 	Q2:  DOC will convene first working meeting of the NACIE and begin identification and formation of subcommittees. 	Q2-4:  EDA will award and administer grants that promote job-driven skills training and undertake quarterly status reviews. 	Q3:  NIST will assess SMARTalent pilot to determine whether modules are on target and whether the delivery model and business case are meeting clients’ needs. 	Q4:  NIST will re-launch MEP Workforce Working Group involving representatives from 10 to 15 states in order to promote learning across MEP centers and share information and best practices.","General Science, Space, and Technology",,,
