These efforts included a number of co-location activities intended to reduce the Department’s overall footprint by sharing space amongst USDA organizations.  CHALLENGES:  USDA continues to work on improving interagency communication, coordination, and program integration to identify additional shared services opportunities to improve efficiencies and to enhance internal control systems to improve both our improper payment rates and IT security infrastructure.",,,,
