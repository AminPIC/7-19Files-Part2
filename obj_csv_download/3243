The inherently transnational nature of homeland security missions necessitates a strong DHS international affairs enterprise that provides compatible visions of homeland security globally, a consistent and mutually beneficial cooperation with foreign partners, and an international footprint that maximizes mission effectiveness and return on investment.  We will pursue the following strategies to strengthen the DHS international affairs enterprise in support of homeland security missions:   	Establish strategic priorities for the Department’s international affairs enterprise by engaging across Components in areas including policy analysis, cross-regional coordination, and management of international affairs issues, to establish a single, accepted view of DHS international operations and engagements. Implementation plans will be developed to responsibly document how DHS Components will implement these strategic priorities in a unified manner. 	Establish coordination and communication mechanisms across the DHS international affairs enterprise to ensure national, Departmental and Component priorities are synchronized and DHS’s international engagements are fully utilized to achieve common objectives.",,"    ","National Defense",,,
