"Department of Homeland Security",24,DHS,"Mission 1:  Prevent terrorism and enhance security",3261,3262,"Goal 1.1:  Prevent Terrorist Attacks","Prevent Terrorist Attacks","The Department remains vigilant to new and evolving threats in order to protect the Nation from a terrorist attack. Although the U.S. Government’s counterterrorism efforts have degraded the ability of al-Qa’ida’s senior leadership in Afghanistan and Pakistan to centrally plan and execute sophisticated external attacks, since 2009 we have seen the rise of al-Qa’ida affiliates, such as al-Qa’ida in the Arabian Peninsula and the al-Nusrah Front in Syria. These groups have made attempts to export terrorism to our Nation. Additionally, we face the threat of domestic-based ""lone offenders"" and those who are inspired by violent extremist ideologies to radicalize and commit acts of terrorism against Americans and the Nation. These threats come in multiple forms and, because of the nature of independent actors, may be hardest to detect.  We will pursue the following strategies to prevent terrorist attacks:   	Analyze, fuse, and disseminate terrorism information by sharing information with, and utilizing threat analysis alongside, stakeholders across the homeland security enterprise.  We remain committed to integrating critical data sources, such as those for biometric data, by consolidating or federating screening and vetting operations. We will also continually increase and integrate domain awareness capabilities, as well as improve our ability to fully utilize vast amounts of intelligence and other information—the so-called ""big data"" challenge—while rigorously protecting privacy and civil rights and civil liberties. 	Deter and disrupt operations by leveraging the intelligence, information sharing, technological, operational, and policy-making elements within DHS to facilitate a cohesive and coordinated operational response. We will also develop intelligence sources and leverage research and analysis to identify and illustrate the tactics, behaviors, and indicators potentially associated with violent extremism as well as factors that may influence violent extremism, and jointly develop with federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial partners training for frontline law enforcement officers on behaviors that may be telling regarding violent extremist activity. 	Strengthen transportation security by using a multi-layered risk-based approach to detect malicious actors and dangerous items at various entry and exit points in the travel and trade system. We will also improve coordination with foreign governments and stakeholders to expand pre-departure screening and enhance transportation security operations among willing partners to mitigate risks from overseas. 	Counter violent extremism by: 1) supporting community-community-based problem solving and integration efforts, as well as local law enforcement programs; and 2) working with our partners to share information with frontline law enforcement partners, communities, families, and the private sector about how violent extremists are using the Internet and how to protect themselves and their communities.",,"The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), has determined that performance toward this goal is making noteworthy progress.  Introduction DHS applies a multifaceted approach to preventing terrorist attacks in the United States, focusing on risk-based passenger and cargo screening, intelligence and information-sharing, and working beyond our borders to deter and disrupt threats at the earliest point possible.  DHS performs and oversees security operations at the Nation’s airports, screening hundreds of millions of passengers annually to ensure the freedom of movement of people and commerce.  Through these efforts, DHS has continued to increase security, achieve system-wide efficiencies, and shortened wait times for the traveling public.  Major Achievements DHS continues to fuse and analyze information from the Intelligence Community, other government agencies, and our foreign partners.  DHS created and disseminated products—such as Roll Call Releases, Joint Intelligence Bulletins, Intelligence Assessments, and TRIPwire—to frontline security and law enforcement partners to assist in their counterterrorism efforts.  DHS developed new technologies to aid in video surveillance, biometrics, and identity management to be used to detect, deter, and disrupt potential terrorist activities.  DHS reduces risk of the flow of passengers and commerce by scanning cargo identified as high risk, updating terrorist watchlists used in vetting and screening operations, implementing biometric vetting systems to better assess immigration benefits applicants, and enhancing security at maritime and surface transportation facilities.  DHS enrolled over 3.6 million travelers in its Trusted Traveler Programs, advanced participation by 11 airlines, and implemented some form of expedited aviation/customs and immigration screening at over 120 airports as of September 30, 2014.  These efforts increased security effectiveness, improved the passenger experience, and achieved efficiencies through targeted reallocation of screening resources.  DHS created programs to counter violent extremism, including Community Awareness Briefings and Community Resiliency Exercises to help communities understand and address terrorist recruitment tactics, and to build partnerships between communities and law enforcement.  In addition, DHS held over 100 community engagement events (as of September 30, 2014) and provided cultural competency trainings to law enforcement personnel across the country.  Major Challenges & Opportunities for Improvement A dynamic threat environment—coupled with lengthy technology development, testing, acquisition, and deployment processes—presents challenges in quickly responding with the most current technology.  Consequently, DHS must accurately determine the best use of resources in most efficiently and effectively fulfilling its mission.  Intelligence-driven, risk-based approaches, supported by streamlined operations, have proven successful in several instances.  Public-private partnerships also present opportunities to share security costs.  The implementation of risk-based screening to identify potential threats while providing a positive experience for the traveling public is a careful balancing act.  DHS is responding to information released by the DHS Office of the Inspector General after this review was completed so as to best manage risk, cost, and impact on the traveling public.   ","National Defense",486,"FY14-15 : Strengthen aviation security counterterrorism capabilities by using intelligence driven information and risk-based decisions.","TSA performs and oversees security operations at the nationâ€™s airports, screening over 650 million passengers annually, to ensure the freedom of movement of people and commerce. In an effort to strengthen aviation security while enhancing the passenger experience, TSA is focusing on risk-based, intelligence-driven security procedures and enhancing its use of technology. Since 2011, the agency has implemented several risk-based initiatives including the TSA PreÃ¼â„¢ expedited screening program; the nationwide implementation of modified screening protocols for passengers 12 and younger, passengers 75 and over, and active duty service members; expediting physical screening of Veterans on chartered Honor Flights; and providing modified screening to Wounded Warriors. Â A number of initiatives will further enable TSA to reach its goal of expanding expedited screening for known populations in order to focus on those that are unknown including the development and deployment of the TSA Preâœ“â„¢ Application and TSA Risk Assessment programs; expansion of Â TSA Preâœ“â„¢participation to international air carrier; continued expansion of the Known Crewmember program; and developing operational policies, procedures, and other activities such as the evolution of checkpoint screening technologies to support deployment of Risk Assessments that will grow the volume of passengers eligible for expedited screening. As of December 2013, on a weekly basis, more than 32% Â of passengers Â receive some form of expedited screening, and TSA expects to continue to grow that number.Â  While driving the growth of eligible populations is key to the initiativeâ€™s long term success, TSA faces challenges in aligning, planning, and executing activities for incorporating these various populations. Â The success of achieving TSAâ€™s risk-based security milestones is in many ways reliant upon external and internal partners that TSA continues to work with to mitigate these challenges."
