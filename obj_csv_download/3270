"Office of Personnel Management",27,OPM,"MG2 Timely, Accurate, and Responsive Customer Service",3269,3270,"MG02.01 Develop and implement a strategic plan for customer service that addresses each of our major program goals","Identifying how customer service improvement will drive achievement of program outcome goals through the LAB @ OPM, human-centered design, and other collaborative methods. 	Taking an inventory of OPM’s points of contact within each customer segment in order to identify duplication, gaps, hidden gems, heroes, best practices, centers of excellence (e.g., OPM's best help desks, most successful customer service training programs, effective customer councils). 	Developing an customer service investment plan that: 	 		supports program goals and builds on our strengths 		leverages resources across OPM and across our partner agencies, 		re-allocates resources from unsuccessful customer service efforts to successful ones, and 		Ensures cross-channel integration so that service is centered on the customer – not organizational units.",,,"OPM’s Customer Experience Strategic Plan establishes a framework that allows each office within the agency to tailor their efforts to the unique experiences of their customers and scale select efforts, as applicable, across OPM. The Customer Experience Strategic Plan was approved by the Director in FY 2015 and the agency began communicating the rollout to all OPM employees.     The agency also delivered OPM wide customer service training, titled the ART of Customer Service, which had a participation rate of 22 percent in FY 2015. After Customer Service Week, the first week of October, the participation rate increased to 25.3 percent.     OPM also established a Chief Experience Officer role, as well as established the foundation for implementation of a “Find and Fix” performance improvement approach, a method of identifying areas of improvements and opportunities, analyzing options for solutions, developing action plans, implementing and tracking action plans, measuring effectiveness of action items, and communicating improvements to improve customer experiences.     The agency also invested in, and rewarded eemployees through the FY 2015 Director’s Awards for Excellence in Customer Service.     By implementing the Customer Experience Strategic Plan, OPM can shift its customer service focus, where appropriate, from a program-centered model to a customer-centered model that is supported by various program offices.  The coordination of services can lead to long-term cost savings by identifying warning signs of escalating customer issues and reducing the number of customer inquiries.     One challenge in implementing this strategy arises from a potential lack of funds to give the acting Chief Experience Officer and internal customer service community of practice the flexibility to hire a full-time Chief Experience Officer in FY 2017 to lead the execution of the Customer Experience Strategic Plan.","General Government",,,
