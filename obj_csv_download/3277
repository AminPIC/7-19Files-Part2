Additionally, OPM partnered with the Good Government Group to collaborate on emerging research agendas and initiatives, allowing the agency to leverage an existing network to establish a data analysis community of practice that included Federal agencies, universities and non-profit organizations. OPM conducted a series of collaborative sessions with universities and other academic institutions to share ongoing and future research initiatives, analytic methods and emerging practices.  One challenge is the development of a standardized process and research agreement that covers the varying types of research arrangements (i.e., academic, private sector, industry, etc.) that OPM is interested in pursuing, and meets the Research Authority criteria, where applicable.","General Government",,,
