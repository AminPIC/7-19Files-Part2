In FY 2014, OPM implemented its new 5-year Strategic Plan, which set the foundation for OPM budgets through FY 2018.  The agency rolled out the Strategic Plan in January 2014, and shortly thereafter completed the FY 2015 Congressional Budget Justification, which aligned resource needs to the new strategic goals and strategies.  OPM then began to make long-term changes to the budget processes and embarked on an effort to incorporate prioritization of requirements as a part of the annual budget process. OPM established an agency council, representative of each program office, to develop the new process, which has been used for two performance budget submissions to identify requirements and validate funding justifications.  To promote transparency, the process also forces visibility into program costs, helps clarify and define the basis for OPM activities and why they are performed, and established a method to prioritize OPM activities using mission based criteria (drivers). OPM created a spreadsheet-based budget prioritization tool to support the process and collect required data and information. As a result, this new process aided in refining agency budget formulation activities.","General Government",,,
