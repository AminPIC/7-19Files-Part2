Five agencies started using USA Performance in FY 2015 to better manage the Senior Executive Service performance appraisal cycle. USA Performance deployed seven releases with new enhancements to the system. Enhancements included plan notes, greater flexibility for HR administrators to manage performance plans, and ability to add agency specific performance requirements.  OPM experienced delays in USA Performance implementation due to individual agencies’ internal competing priorities, and in a few agencies, rollout was delayed until the second or third quarters.     OPM has continued to support the implementation of the President’s Management Agenda People and Culture Cross-Agency Priority goal, and has made significant progress in achieving the deliverables established for the goal – particularly with regard to SES reform and modernization, including SES onboarding.  For example, agencies are currently piloting an enhanced SES onboarding framework, and OPM is meeting with agency SES onboarding program coordinators and program champions to share pilot details and materials, including the enhanced framework.","General Government",,,
