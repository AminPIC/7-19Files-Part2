"Department of Energy",19,DOE,"Science and Energy",5182,5202,"Energy Infrastructure","Support a more economically competitive, environmentally responsible, secure and resilient U.S. energy infrastructure","The nation’s transformation to a clean energy economy requires a modern energy infrastructure that can integrate a diverse energy portfolio, respond to and recover rapidly from disruptions, and deliver highly reliable and affordable energy. As called for in the Climate Action Plan, a modernized energy infrastructure also must become more resilient to prepare the United States for the impacts of climate change. In a clean energy economy, communications and control technologies that support the development and integration of variable energy resources become more critical, and DOE will seek pathways that expand the use of dispatchable renewable energy including hydropower, energy storage, and demand response capabilities. While advanced intelligent devices and communications networks improve the visibility, response, and control of energy systems, they also can increase the exposure to cyber attacks. DOE will focus on addressing and helping to manage the increased vulnerability of the nation’s energy infrastructures due to climate change, cyber vulnerabilities, physical vulnerabilities, and infrastructure interdependencies.  DOE will facilitate the market-readiness of DOE-supported technologies and address non-technical barriers that will enable the marketplace to better understand the cost-saving and environmental benefits of these energy solutions, including engaging the future clean energy workforce.","Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability; Energy Policy and Systems Analysis; Fossil Energy â€“ Petroleum Reserves","Last year, agencies were required to review progress made toward strategic objectives using the agency Strategic Plan, and release summary results on Performance.gov in February 2015. The agency’s strategic review considers performance goals and other evidence, as well as challenges, risks, and external factors that may have affected the outcomes. OMB works with agencies to determine which strategic objectives require focused improvement or noteworthy progress relative to other strategic objectives. Because the Department of Energy released their strategic plan late in 2014, the Department did not complete a strategic review in 2014, but is expected to conduct the review in the future.","Energy||Natural Resources and Environment",5041,"FY14-15 : Enhance desirable characteristics and diminish vulnerabilities of the U.S. energy infrastructure to meet goals of economic competitiveness, national security, and environmental responsibility","Support the Quadrennial Energy Review (QER): Innovation and new sources of domestic energy supply are transforming the nation’s energy marketplace, creating economic opportunities at the same time they raise environmental challenges. To ensure that federal energy policy meets our economic, environmental, and security goals in this changing landscape, the Administration will conduct a Quadrennial Energy Review which will be led by the White House Domestic Policy Council and Office of Science and Technology Policy, supported by a Secretariat established at the Department of Energy, and involving the robust engagement of federal agencies and outside stakeholders. This first-ever review will focus on infrastructure challenges, and will identify the threats, risks, and opportunities for U.S. energy and climate security, enabling the federal government to translate policy goals into a set of analytically based, clearly articulated, sequenced and integrated actions, and proposed investments over a four-year planning horizon."
