"Department of Energy",19,DOE,"Nuclear Security",5232,5282,"Provide Safe and Effective Integrated Nuclear Propulsion Systems for the U.S. Navy","Provide safe and effective integrated nuclear propulsion systems for the U.S. Navy","DOE provides the design, development, and operational support required to provide militarily effective nuclear propulsion plants and ensure their safe, reliable, and long-lived operation. DOE is responsible for the reactor plant design and development for the Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine replacement, which will include new technology to allow lower-cost construction while enhancing plant safety and survivability and reducing life-cycle costs. It also will refuel its land-based reactor plant prototype in support of essential research and development efforts, and work toward the recapitalization of the program’s 50-year old used nuclear fuel infrastructure to ensure the flexibility needed to adjust to future mission demands.","National Nuclear Security Administration","Last year, agencies were required to review progress made toward strategic objectives using the agency Strategic Plan, and release summary results on Performance.gov in February 2015. The agency’s strategic review considers performance goals and other evidence, as well as challenges, risks, and external factors that may have affected the outcomes. OMB works with agencies to determine which strategic objectives require focused improvement or noteworthy progress relative to other strategic objectives. Because the Department of Energy released their strategic plan late in 2014, the Department did not complete a strategic review in 2014, but is expected to conduct the review in the future.","National Defense",,,
