Achieving baseline proficiency and maintaining high levels of readiness in homeland security-related individual and collective skills and knowledge are critical to a unified partnership of law enforcement, first responders, and other front-line operators.  We will pursue the following strategies to train and exercise frontline operators and first responders:   	Support systems for training, exercising, and evaluating capabilities by pursuing integrated and cohesive cross-component training and evaluation. 	Support law enforcement, first responder, and risk management training by providing coordinated, interoperable, and standardized law enforcement training to DHS and non-DHS federal agents/officers as well as to state, local, tribal and territorial and international entities.",,,"National Defense",,,
