OCR has dramatically increased the efficiency and accuracy of the CRDC by launching a newly developed and improved data collection tool. Many new features of the data collection tool contributed to the increased efficiency and data accuracy, including the ability of LEAs and schools to (1) preview future CRDC questions that will be mandatory for the 2015–16 CRDC and to submit data voluntarily (optional) for these questions early, as part of the 2013–14 collection; (2) receive automated, customized edit checks of data entries prior to final data submission/ certification; (3) obtain individualized district feedback reports that summarize the 2013–14 data submitted; and (4) benefit from the prepopulation of some survey data items from 8 SEAs to reduce approximately 2,000 LEAs’ reporting burden. As a result, 17,000 LEAs can receive real-time summary reports of their 2013–14 CRDC data up to 8 months earlier and at least 2,000 LEAs’ burden to comply with data violation to launching an investigation by as much as one year, thus bringing speedier relief to complainants. Data for the 2013–14 CRDC will be available in the spring of 2016.  In FY 2015, OCR, in collaboration with OELA, supported major investments in the quality of the CRDC data, including the disaggregated data for ELs in all public schools. This new feature of the CRDC website allows access to individual district or school level EL profiles that include information about the demographics of EL students and their participation in early childhood, gifted and talented, AP, SAT, college and career readiness, math and science courses, and discipline. OCR worked with OELA to develop and publish the EL Toolkit to support the implementation of EL Guidance. The toolkit was launched nationally at the end of April and all ten chapters are now available online. OCR continues to promote the EL guidance and toolkit through speaking engagements and technical assistance.  In the policy arena, in FY 2015, OCR released nine guidance documents of critical importance to the Department, schools, civil rights stakeholders and the public—the most issued in one fiscal year in OCR history—concerning: (1) the Title VI requirements around resource equity and resource comparability; (2) obligations of elementary and secondary schools to respond to the bullying of SWDs; (3) schools’ obligations surrounding effective communication for SWDs; (4) questions and answers on Title IX and single-sex elementary and secondary classes and extracurricular activities; (5) applicability of federal civil rights laws to juvenile justice residential facilities; (6) implementing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Ebola guidance for schools; (7) schools’ obligations to ensure that EL students can participate meaningfully and equally in school and to communicate information to limited English proficient parents in a language they can understand; (8) addressing the risk of measles in schools and school obligations to SWDs medically unable to obtain vaccinations; and (9) the importance and role of Title IX coordinators.  In order to further disseminate and deliver the message of these policy guidance documents to communities nationwide, OCR provided more than 220 technical assistance sessions to recipients and other stakeholders. These sessions were conducted by employees from all of OCR’s twelve regional and enforcement offices throughout the nation, and from headquarters, including Program Legal Group staff.  In FY 2015, OCR received a new record-high number of complaints (10,394, vs. 9,983 in FY 2014) and resolved 9,232 complaints (compared to 9,864 in FY 2014)—including a higher number of complex and systemic case resolutions than in FY 2014—despite experiencing the lowest staffing levels in OCR history (average of 539).  Additionally, OCR increased the transparency of its work to the public by making available a list of colleges and universities currently being investigated under Title IX related to sexual violence; posting hundreds of resolution agreements with educational institutions on its website; and overhauling the website to make more easily accessible information about OCR’s civil rights enforcement work (including resolution letters and agreements from FY 2014 forward); policy guidance documents; frequently asked questions about the laws OCR enforces; and a robust reading room with publications, pamphlets, and other materials. In total, there are now more than 800 cases available on the website. OCR’s customer service team responded to 7,430 hotline calls, answered 3,397 public inquiries, and fulfilled 8,775 publication requests for OCR documents to ensure the public has accurate information about civil rights laws and policy to promote equity in education.","Education, Training, Employment, and Social Services",,,
