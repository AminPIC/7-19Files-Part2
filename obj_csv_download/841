The Department also develops and applies more effective scientific methods to prevent, detect, eradicate, or manage pests and diseases. These efforts contribute to the overall agricultural health of the Nation and the world.",,"ACHIEVEMENTS: In FY 2015, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) addressed a variety of pests and diseases and worked to develop ways to mitigate the damages caused by significant threats to U.S. agricultural production. For example, APHIS took the lead in responding to the outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), the largest animal health emergency in U.S. history.  CHALLENGES: USDA must continually prioritize the list of major pest and disease threats. These threats are increasing both domestically and internationally. The Department’s surveillance efforts will need to be adjusted to respond to these threats.",Agriculture||Health,,,
