Available at at http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/about-tarp/Pages/default.aspx.","Domestic Finance","The emergency financial crisis response programs continue to wind down effectively.  In December 2014, the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) fully liquidated its investment in Ally Financial and realized cumulative receipts of $19.6 billion ($2.4 billion more than invested).  The ultimate cost to taxpayers of TARP programs dropped from the FY 2009 estimate of $341.0 billion to $37.2 billion as of September 2015.  TARP’s foreclosure prevention programs provided more than 1.5 million homeowners with permanent mortgage modifications, which equates to approximately $38.7 billion in realized monthly mortgage payment savings for these homeowners.","General Government",,,
