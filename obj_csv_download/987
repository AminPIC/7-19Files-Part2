"Department of Transportation",21,DOT,"Environmental Sustainability ",5322,987,"MITIGATE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS","Avoid and mitigate transportation-related impacts to climate, ecosystems, and communities by helping partners make informed project planning decisions through an analysis of acceptable alternatives, balancing the need to obtain sound environmental outcomes with demands to accelerate project delivery.","Our recent emphasis on ecosystem approaches to determining the environmental impact of transportation projects has promoted broader mitigation and conservation strategies.  However, the Nation’s investments in transportation systems and infrastructure will only be sustainable if we more broadly consider the secondary effects of construction and land use.  Although transportation projects comply with requirements for management of stormwater runoff, and federal funds are available for restoration activities, more must be done to meet the challenge of reducing transportation’s contribution to water quality problems.  We must balance this need against the demand for faster project delivery time, which is often determined by the environmental permitting process.  We will work to improve internal project delivery processes and identify opportunities for enhanced interagency harmonization, through continued DOT initiatives, implementing Executive Order 13604 to streamline infrastructure projects, and other related efforts.",,"The Department is working to address and mitigate environmental impacts of transportation.  DOT has met three of the four targets for which current data is available. Key results include:   	Reductions in number of people exposed to high aviation sound levels; 	Continued progress with MARAD ship disposal.   Although PHMSA did not meet its target for reducing hazardous pipeline spills, the number of pipeline spills with environmental consequence continued to go down.  Key efforts include:   	FAA's promotion of noise reduction technologies through its CLEEN Program; 	Refinement of PHMSA's hazardous pipeline spills to focus on those with environmental consequence in order to more set more aggressive targets; and 	Maintaining an expeditious ship disposal rate of the obsolete, government-owned ships in Suisun Bay.","Natural Resources and Environment||Transportation",,,
