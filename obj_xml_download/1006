</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Office of Small Business Utilization (OSBU)</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>Delivering the best value for government and the American people requires taking advantage of all resources. Central to that approach is expanding opportunities for small businesses throughout the country. In FY 2014, GSA received its third consecutive A rating from the Small Business Administration (SBA).&amp;nbsp;

In FY 2015, GSA’s small business goals include: Small business - 32%; SDBs - 5%; WOSBs – 5%; HUBZones – 3. %; SDVOSBs – 3;00%. GSA anticipates meeting all of its small business goals. However, final results for FY 2015 will be realeased by the Small Business Administration in May of 2016.

In FY 2015, GSA continues to focus on the HUBZone goal. GSA participates in HUBZone outreach events at the regional and national levels; identifies HUBZone concerns in each buying activity and gives HUBZone businesses direct access to buyers and contracting officers. GSA’s Office of Small Business Utilization (OSBU) conducts internal training sessions with buyers and project managers to educate them about market research resources and to clarify the use of HUBZone set-asides under the new parity guidelines.&amp;nbsp; GSA collaborates with the SBA to host HUBZone and other small business contracting webinars to provide facts and resources to the acquisition workforce. These webinars provide education on contracting with HUBZones in an effort to assist with meeting the 3% HubZone small business goal.

GSA cascaded its national small business contracting priorities into actionable plans at the buying activity level, and worked closely with SBA Procurement Center Representatives. Each regional GSA small business utilization center developed an engagement plan focused on goal achievement for the regional buying activity for which they are responsible.

In FY 2014, over 37% conducted through the Multiple Award Schedules were awarded to small and disadvantaged businesses compared to an annual target of 33%. GSA exceeded all small business prime contracting goals with the exception of Small Business, where 38.97% was attained vs. performance target of 39%. Final numbers for small business performance for FY 2014 were reported by the SBA in August 2015.

Strategic Objective Next Steps. GSA plans to take the following actions in support of this strategic objective:

1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Monitoring, oversight, and accountability


	Enhance level of detail in reports GSA uses to track and monitor progress against subcontracting goals to show greater visibility into specific buying activities
	Develop reporting dashboards for PBS and the Office of Administrative Services (OAS) to assist with tracking subcontracting goals and reporting progress as well as aid in monitoring of prime contractor compliance with reporting requirements.
	Continue to include weekly updates on subcontracting progress to agency leadership through the Agency Weekly Report and team briefings for senior management.
	Issue guidance from the Administrator regarding the importance of meeting small business goals, including all subcontracting goals
	Conduct targeted conversations with regional and business line leadership where subcontracting goals are not being met
	Perform targeted monitoring and spot checks with the Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (SRS), and follow-up with prime contractors that are not meeting their subcontracting goals
	Partner with SBA to conduct Subcontracting Compliance Review site visits for major, high-dollar contracts, with a focus on FSSI, and National Broker Contracts. Conduct select reviews by desk audit.
	Include in annual Procurement Management Reviews (PMRs), or conduct individual Small Business Compliance Reviews (SBCRs), an evaluation of contracting officer monitoring of subcontracting plans, and the reporting of contractor performance against, and efforts to achieve, small business goals in the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS); six PMRs and/or SBCRs were conducted in FY 2015, four more are planned for FY 2016
	Continue to publish subcontracting goals and progress to the internal OSBU subcontracting website on a weekly basis
	Continue to encourage teams to promote and negotiate aggressive subcontracting plan goals as appropriate for individual projects
	Collaborate with program offices and provide guidance and oversight when new requirements are developed to determine if small business can be utilized either in partial or a total capacity (i.e., Business Cases, Bundling Analysis, Consolidation Analysis and the Small Business Analysis Record)
	Utilize GSA’s social media platforms to communicate current small business goal status and offer encouragement to continue working towards reaching those goals
