Strategies:


	Maintain information security preparedness;
	Continually adjust security processes and procedures to reflect changes in technology, the sensitivity of our data and systems, and awareness of actual and potential internal and external threats;
	Perform risk-based systems reviews to enhance continuous-monitoring and data-loss-prevention strategies; and
	Enhance our audit trail, integrity review, and fraud-prevention processes.

</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Office of Systems</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>We took the following steps in FY 2015 to strengthen our cyber security program (see Key Initiatives and Performance Measures for more details):


	Implemented several new processes and capabilities to strengthen our cybersecurity program, including:
	
		Security awareness training campaign;
		Continued implementation use of Personal Identity Verification credentials; and
		Continuous dashboard monitoring.
	
	


Next Steps


	Implement new technical architecture to strengthen our audit trail system capabilities and help prevent fraud; and
	Continued compliance (meet or exceed targets) with all applicable cyber security guidance, best practices, mandates, and requirements related to the Cross-Agency Priority goals.

Today’s fast-paced, technology-driven environment requires sophisticated, connected service options to serve the public and our employees.  We must employ modern technology platforms and systems design to support more flexible, efficient processes.  Our strategies focus on evolving our infrastructure to incorporate stable, modern technologies that align with our business needs.  As our workloads increase, our systems must keep pace with the demand.  Expanding online and mobile-friendly access improves service for those who want the convenience of interacting with us remotely while preserving field office services for situations that need in-person support.
The security of our information and systems is an essential responsibility, and we will enhance our cybersecurity protections.
