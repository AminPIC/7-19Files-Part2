	Build a strong, diverse applicant pool through the use of various hiring flexibilities and programs, including Office of Personnel Management’s Pathways programs and volunteer internships;
	Market and expand use of hiring authorities for veterans and individuals with disabilities; and

One of our greatest challenges now and in the future is the loss of our most experienced employees.  The size of our workforce has declined by about 11,000 employees since the beginning of FY 2011 and we expect this trend to continue.  Based on our FY 2013 Retirement Wave Report, we estimate that more than 21,000 of our employees will retire by FY 2022.  A shrinking workforce affects our ability to meet the needs and expectations of our customers and stakeholders.
Changing population demographics, coupled with future staffing shortages, threaten our ability to maintain a future workforce that mirrors the public we serve.  As our Nation becomes more diverse, limits on hiring will challenge our ability to acquire talent including under representative minorities and bilingual candidates, which may affect our service delivery to non-English speaking customers.  We will pursue strategies to meet these challenges, to ensure we align our workforce with the needs and expectations of the American public.
Additionally, as we explore ways to automate, streamline, and change our business processes in fundamental ways, we will need to ensure we have expertise in the programmatic, data, and IT areas.  To ensure we maintain this expertise, we will implement employee-centered programs that foster development and facilitate knowledge transfer, succession, and retention.  We also will conduct skill-gap analyses; leverage employee skills and competencies to meet our workload demands; and ensure an environment that supports inclusion, engagement, collaboration, performance, and accountability.  Telework and other workplace flexibilities will be part of this modernized environment.
