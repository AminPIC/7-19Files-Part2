As we make changes over the next few years, we must ensure that we continue to promote and support employees’ well-being and motivation.&amp;nbsp; We will find ways to keep morale high by offering workplace flexibilities such as expanded use of telework.&amp;nbsp; We will also encourage changes that support employee creativity, work-life balance, and family-friendly policies to foster employee engagement at all levels of the organization.

Strategies:


	Promote work-life balance and employee well-being through workplace flexibilities;
	Ensure access to employee services (e.g., financial literacy, career development, work-life resources) regardless of geographic location;
	Provide employees and managers with support to navigate complex personnel matters (e.g., employee conduct, performance, reasonable accommodations);
	Promote safety of employees through ongoing safety training and emergency preparedness activities;
	Engage labor organizations to promote collaboration and transparency; and
	Develop practices that facilitate open communication and understanding in order to enhance employee engagement and appreciation of our diversity.

We took the following steps in FY 2015 to foster an inclusive culture that promotes employee well-being, innovation, and engagement (see Key Initiatives and Performance Measures for more details):

• Expanded employee telework participation;

• Promoted work-life balance support offered to employees;

• Used Diversity and Inclusion Council to pilot the National Mentor Program;

• Established an Employee Engagement Community of Practice;

• Switched to new digital emergency radio system;

• Surveyed employees to find out their experiences with diversity and inclusion;

• Established a program to identify and overcome barriers hindering our diversity and inclusion efforts; and

• Collaborated with our three labor unions on workplace issues and held reoccurring forums.

Next Steps

• Identify and market potential career paths for employees;

• Expand the number of eligible employees participating in telework;

• Research and develop plan for reducing realty costs through initiatives like hoteling and shared workplaces;

• Continue labor management and employee relations forums; and

One of our greatest challenges now and in the future is the loss of our most experienced employees.  The size of our workforce has declined by about 11,000 employees since the beginning of FY 2011 and we expect this trend to continue.  Based on our FY 2013 Retirement Wave Report, we estimate that more than 21,000 of our employees will retire by FY 2022.  A shrinking workforce affects our ability to meet the needs and expectations of our customers and stakeholders.
Changing population demographics, coupled with future staffing shortages, threaten our ability to maintain a future workforce that mirrors the public we serve.  As our Nation becomes more diverse, limits on hiring will challenge our ability to acquire talent including under representative minorities and bilingual candidates, which may affect our service delivery to non-English speaking customers.  We will pursue strategies to meet these challenges, to ensure we align our workforce with the needs and expectations of the American public.
Additionally, as we explore ways to automate, streamline, and change our business processes in fundamental ways, we will need to ensure we have expertise in the programmatic, data, and IT areas.  To ensure we maintain this expertise, we will implement employee-centered programs that foster development and facilitate knowledge transfer, succession, and retention.  We also will conduct skill-gap analyses; leverage employee skills and competencies to meet our workload demands; and ensure an environment that supports inclusion, engagement, collaboration, performance, and accountability.  Telework and other workplace flexibilities will be part of this modernized environment.
