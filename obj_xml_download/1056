As part of a broader initiative to support one-stop online access to multiple government services, we will collaborate with other government agencies and community organizations to install Social Security Express kiosks (i.e., self-service computer stations offering access to our online services) at their respective facilities. &amp;nbsp;This collaboration will benefit both the customer and our agency as we anticipate cost savings from expanding our online self-service options.

We will work to increase our collaboration with the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs on the Wounded Warriors Initiative.&amp;nbsp; In this effort, we focus on improving the transfer of medical information, expediting the disability claims process, and facilitating payments to wounded service members, veterans, and their families. &amp;nbsp;Electronic sharing of medical information is a key feature of this initiative.

Strategies:


	Pending result of the pilot, implement Social Security Express to provide service using self-service kiosks in community locations;
	Provide Social Security services through other government agencies, community-based organizations, tribal governments, and private organizations that serve our customers;
	Increase collaboration with the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs to improve processes for veterans and service members; and
	Improve information sharing among other government agencies for records, data, and other information.

</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Office of Operations</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>We took the following steps in FY 2015 to improve customers’ experience through partnerships with other agencies (see Key Initiatives and Performance Measures for more details):

Our goal is to achieve even greater success in customer service and satisfaction through innovative online self-service options.  Each year, we see greater acceptance of technology across all demographic segments and a stronger preference for doing business online.  In particular, Internet use by seniors continues to rise.  To capitalize on this trend, we will increase the number of services we offer online and will communicate more with our customers online.
Because of the complexities of the programs we administer, we will provide customer support for our online services for times when customers need advice or assistance.  In keeping with the Administration’s one-government approach, we will partner with other agencies and community organizations to offer access to more government services online through increasing use of video servcies and the implementation of Social Security Express to provide servive using self-service kiosks.
We will continue to adjust our physical office structure to reflect our online service emphasis.  However, we will remain mindful of the importance of continuing to provide in-person service for those customers whose business with us requires it.  Technology will not replace employees.  Instead, it will free them to handle the more complex workloads and the individuals who require in-person help.  It will also give our employees tools to help them handle increasingly varied and complex work.
