To further educate and engage the public, and support completion of their business at the first point of contact, we will streamline our online disability application. &amp;nbsp;We also will increase our inventory of informational videos for our website and YouTube, and produce more webinars. &amp;nbsp;These initiatives will help to increase customers’ understanding of our programs, as well as inform them of our policies and requirements up front and enhance their experience with us.

Strategies:


	Implement online support options, including click to talk, screen sharing, and instant messaging;
	Integrate our online applications, such as the streamlined online disability application; and
	Increase the use of video service.

</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Office of Operations</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>We took the following steps in FY 2015 to help ensure our customers can complete their business during their first contact with us (see Key Initiatives and Performance Measures for more details):


	Completed the nationwide rollout of the Social Security Electronic Remittance System in December 2014;
	Installed 122 of the 133 desktop video units we purchased in FY 2014 in third-party locations;
	Implemented dynamic help and click-to-call back customer service features within the my Social Security portal; and
	Implemented a proof of concept to determine if we can use less expensive hardware to provide video service.


Next Steps


	Continue planning and analysis for customer engagement tools for click-to-chat, click-to-video chat, screen sharing, secure messaging, and online notices within the my Social Security portal;
	Continue the planning and analysis phase of SMART claim, allowing customers to apply for all benefits with a single application, including Supplemental Security Income; and
	Expand video service delivery to new locations.

Our goal is to achieve even greater success in customer service and satisfaction through innovative online self-service options.  Each year, we see greater acceptance of technology across all demographic segments and a stronger preference for doing business online.  In particular, Internet use by seniors continues to rise.  To capitalize on this trend, we will increase the number of services we offer online and will communicate more with our customers online.
Because of the complexities of the programs we administer, we will provide customer support for our online services for times when customers need advice or assistance.  In keeping with the Administration’s one-government approach, we will partner with other agencies and community organizations to offer access to more government services online through increasing use of video servcies and the implementation of Social Security Express to provide servive using self-service kiosks.
We will continue to adjust our physical office structure to reflect our online service emphasis.  However, we will remain mindful of the importance of continuing to provide in-person service for those customers whose business with us requires it.  Technology will not replace employees.  Instead, it will free them to handle the more complex workloads and the individuals who require in-person help.  It will also give our employees tools to help them handle increasingly varied and complex work.
