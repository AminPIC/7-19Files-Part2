</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>HUD will continue to work with other agencies, Congress, and stakeholder groups to promote a sustainable housing system. In doing so, HUD aims to minimize taxpayer risk by fostering private capital as a primary source of liquidity, and focus government participation while allowing it to maintain its counter-cyclical role. The right solution will ensure continued access to home ownership and multifamily investment opportunities for creditworthy borrowers while avoiding the problem of private gains and public losses.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Office of Policy Development and Research</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>The housing market continued to improve in FY 2015, and HUD continues to monitor borrower composition and origination trends to ensure our target borrowers are being served. HUD initiated work on appropriate strategies for developing enhanced credit scorecards. As always, HUD continues to engage with stakeholders and policymakers to ensure potential housing finance reform legislation meets the Administration’s housing policy priorities.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>The state of the housing market plays a large role in stabilizing our neighborhoods and strengthening our national economy. That is why the downturn of the housing market—with high rates of foreclosure, increases in vacant properties, and plummeting home values—was so devastating for families and communities alike. Although the largest factors contributing to this crisis were market driven—including a slowdown in the growth of home prices, increased high-risk subprime and predatory lending, and lax underwriting standards—the American people turned to Congress and the Administration for leadership and action in righting our nation’s housing market. Since the crisis, HUD has played a critical role in this federal recovery strategy—helping American families keep their homes and stabilizing neighborhoods hard hit by foreclosure. HUD seeks to continue to build upon this federal leadership and take a comprehensive approach to tackle the housing crisis by supporting mortgage finance reform legislation. As the housing market continues to recover, HUD will focus on ensuring underserved communities have access to credit while managing risk to the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) portfolio and doing so in a way that encourages more private investment in the housing market. This work will put HUD in a strong position to minimize the negative impact of any future market disruptions.
