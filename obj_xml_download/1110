</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>One of Treasury’s most visible responsibilities is to reliably provide safe, secure, cost-effective, and high-quality U.S. currency notes and coins that are readily accepted by all users.&amp;nbsp; In addition to currency production, Treasury also facilitates commerce by regulating alcohol and tobacco products and producers to ensure that American businesses operate in a fair, competitive marketplace and provide complete and accurate information to consumers about alcohol products. &amp;nbsp;These functions facilitate seamless and stable commerce, which is a necessary condition for domestic growth and stability.

During the summer of 2015, Secretary Lew announced that the $10 bill, the first in a new family of notes, will undergo a redesign and that a woman's portrait will be featured on U.S. paper currency for the first time in more than a century.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The newly designed note is also expected to incorporate a raised tactile feature that increases accessibility and usability for the blind and visually impaired community.&amp;nbsp; As part of his announcement, the Secretary asked Americans to engage in the redesign process by weighing in on whose portrait should be featured and how currency can honor the country’s rich history of democracy.&amp;nbsp; Treasury received more than 1.5 million responses from the public to date through face to face meetings, roundtables, town halls, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, emails, and handwritten letters.


The Department is also working to evaluate the future of coins.&amp;nbsp; The U.S. Mint provided research to Congress on potential alternative metals for coins that could drive down metal costs.&amp;nbsp;


FACILITATION OF COMMERCE
Treasury plays an important role in facilitating commerce for certain industries, such as the alcoholic beverage industry, that rely on Treasury’s approval to enter the market.&amp;nbsp; As these industries continue to expand, particularly in the small winery, brewery, and spirits areas, new businesses that are qualified to operate are waiting longer for permits.&amp;nbsp; Further, increased demand for approvals of alcohol beverage labels and formulas, and declining resources to manage the approval processes, has required Treasury to work to fundamentally reshape these programs.&amp;nbsp; Processing times for these approvals have also increased in recent years, which impede compliant commerce for industry members, and are particularly detrimental to small business.&amp;nbsp; Recent efforts to reduce processing times—including an expanded list of label revisions allowable without new approval—have been outpaced by industry growth.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Economic growth stimulates opportunity, mobility, and security for Americans; and allows citizens and businesses to have more confidence in the safety and soundness of the financial system.  Treasury is committed to promoting these ends over the next four years.
 
In late 2008 and early 2009, Treasury put in place a set of emergency programs to help halt a historic financial crisis, restore confidence in the economy, and restart economic growth.  In 2010, Congress passed and the President signed into law comprehensive regulatory reform to address key gaps and weaknesses in the financial system and to better protect consumers against fraud and abuse.[1]  In the last four years, Treasury has led the Administration’s efforts to implement these financial reforms and bring stability back to the domestic economy.
 
Looking ahead to the next four years, Treasury will continue its work promoting domestic stability in response to the financial crisis, building and strengthening domestic financial institutions and markets, and identifying emerging issues requiring Treasury leadership.  Treasury will work to improve the health of the American workforce by promoting major initiatives that focus on job and skill creation and growing the tax base.  Treasury also aims to stimulate domestic economic growth by facilitating commerce and promoting savings, access to credit, and affordable housing options.
