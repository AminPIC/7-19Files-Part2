</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>Treasury’s Office of Technical Assistance directly assists developing countries that have demonstrated strong commitments to reforming their public financial management or financial systems. &amp;nbsp;Technical Assistance Advisors work directly with finance ministries and central banks in developing countries worldwide to strengthen their capacity to manage public finances – through efficient revenue collection, well-planned and executed budgets, judicious debt management, fundamentally sound banking systems, and strong controls to combat corruption and economic crimes. &amp;nbsp;This work encourages prosperity and stability in other parts of the world and supports broader U.S. government international objectives — such as increasing transparency and accountability, reducing corruption, and strengthening the development of market-based policies and practice — while helping to create more stable international markets for U.S. exports.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>International Affairs</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>Treasury, in consulation with the Office of Management and Budget, has determined that performance toward this objective is making noteworthy progress, due to the Office of Technical Assistance’s (OTA) reputation in program management and the results of recently completed projects, particularly in Latin America where OTA helped to establish Latin America’s first Tax Inspector General.

Treasury continues to provide critical technical assistance to finance ministries and central banks in developing countries.&amp;nbsp; In FY 2015, Treasury’s Office of Technical Assistance (OTA) successfully completed several projects in Latin America to provide regional models of excellence in public financial management.&amp;nbsp; For example, Treasury’s assistance enabled the establishment of the first tax inspector general within the Colombian government, now seen as a leader and model for surrounding countries.&amp;nbsp; In FY2015, OTA also continued to provide technical assistance to the Ukrainian government as part of the U.S. Government’s rapid response to stabilize the banking sector and strengthen government finances.&amp;nbsp;

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Treasury protects and supports American economic prosperity by strengthening the external environment for U.S. growth, preventing and mitigating global financial instability, and managing key global challenges.​  We promote policy positions, secure commitments, and negotiate agreements to develop existing and create new export markets for U.S. businesses and workers; manage near-term risks from financial instability abroad that could undermine the U.S. economy; press for market-determined exchange rates; boost consumption-led economic growth in surplus economies around the world; and assist counterparts in emerging economies in building sound financial systems free from corruption and economic crime.
 
In recent years, the economic crisis in Europe, transitions in the Middle East and North Africa, natural disasters that have severely impacted local economies, and other emerging global threats have all presented challenges to the global economy. In response, Treasury has worked to respond to these challenges with its counterparts bilaterally in foreign ministries of finance and central banks as well as multilaterally through the Group of 20 (G-20), Financial Stability Board (FSB), international financial institutions (IFIs), and other forums.With the help of these partners, Treasury seeks to open new opportunities for American businesses and workers, level the playing field for U.S. firms doing business abroad, develop sound international financial regulatory standards consistent with domestic reforms, promote economic stability in strategically important countries, and leverage U.S. leadership positions in the IFIs to advance sound economic and financial policies around the world.
