</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>A strong Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is critical to the recovery of the housing market and our economy at large. The mortgage insurance provided by FHA has made financing available to individuals and families not adequately served by the conventional private mortgage market. The Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMIF) is the largest fund covering activities of FHA. The recession put substantial strain on the MMIF as private capital retreated and FHA played a counter-cyclical role to support the broader housing market. Over time, FHA has experienced significant swings in its market share as it has stepped in to provide insured loans for qualified borrowers who would otherwise be shut out of the mortgage market.&amp;nbsp;

In addition, the severe decline in house prices, the sluggish performance of the economy, and the behavior of some lending partners resulted in increased FHA losses that drove its capital reserve ratio &amp;nbsp;below the congressionally-mandated two percent level.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Office of Housing</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>HUD is designating the FHA financial health objective as making noteworthy progress. HUD continues to make progress restoring the financial health of the FHA Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMIF). During FY 2015, FHA’s capital reserve ratio climbed above the congressionally-mandated level of two percent for the first time since 2008, reaching 2.07 percent. In FY 2016, HUD will continue to monitor the health of the MMIF and, in particular, the impact of HECM volatility.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>The state of the housing market plays a large role in stabilizing our neighborhoods and strengthening our national economy. That is why the downturn of the housing market—with high rates of foreclosure, increases in vacant properties, and plummeting home values—was so devastating for families and communities alike. Although the largest factors contributing to this crisis were market driven—including a slowdown in the growth of home prices, increased high-risk subprime and predatory lending, and lax underwriting standards—the American people turned to Congress and the Administration for leadership and action in righting our nation’s housing market. Since the crisis, HUD has played a critical role in this federal recovery strategy—helping American families keep their homes and stabilizing neighborhoods hard hit by foreclosure. HUD seeks to continue to build upon this federal leadership and take a comprehensive approach to tackle the housing crisis by supporting mortgage finance reform legislation. As the housing market continues to recover, HUD will focus on ensuring underserved communities have access to credit while managing risk to the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) portfolio and doing so in a way that encourages more private investment in the housing market. This work will put HUD in a strong position to minimize the negative impact of any future market disruptions.
