</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>We will employ, develop, and foster a collaborative, values-driven, and capable workforce by focusing&amp;nbsp;our efforts on: 1) promoting greater leadership effectiveness, 2) enhancing employee engagement, and&amp;nbsp;3) addressing performance results.


The Department will face a number of challenges and changes in the years ahead, as we continue to&amp;nbsp;address the housing recovery during a period of fiscal constraints. Changes in housing markets and&amp;nbsp;communities around the nation are speeding up, just as natural disasters and the need for rebuilding&amp;nbsp;communities across America is also increasing. Meanwhile, it is estimated that 57% of HUD’s workforce&amp;nbsp;will be eligible to retire by 2015. To accomplish our mission in the years ahead, we must capture the&amp;nbsp;wisdom and knowledge of our current and departing technical experts and leaders and transmit it to their&amp;nbsp;successors. In that regard, we must value and utilize more effectively the contributions of all our&amp;nbsp;employees as vital members of our workforce and help them fulfill their professional development and&amp;nbsp;career needs.


By improving leadership effectiveness, investing in employee engagement, and addressing performance&amp;nbsp;challenges, we will build a more collaborative workforce, demonstrate our core values, and grow our&amp;nbsp;capabilities. By fulfilling our roles as a trusted strategic partner, a human capital compliance expert, and&amp;nbsp;a transactions facilitator for HUD’s employees, we can ensure that HUD’s workforce is ready to achieve&amp;nbsp;its mission of creating sustainable, inclusive communities and quality, affordable homes for all.

OCHCO successfully completed all identified objectives: a strategic workforce and succession-planning tool was piloted; the Department-wide engagement strategy was developed and deployed leading to best in government improvements; and the Succession Plan for 2015-2018 was completed, which included direction for program offices and identification of mission-critical and high-risk/high-impact positions for development of technical and managerial competencies. HUD’s EVS Engagement index increased to 62 percent in FY 2015, up from 57 percent in FY 2014.&amp;nbsp; OCHCO also coordinated efforts agency-wide to establish engagement strategies for each office, based on EVS scores and feedback from employees and managers.
