</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>HUD data can be unreliable, inaccessible, and redundant, with new systems or datasets created to&amp;nbsp;address faulty data rather than fixing the original data source. Moreover, HUD has historically had a&amp;nbsp;fragmented approach to technology adoption, which leads to multiple platforms and multiple services&amp;nbsp;competing for resources. Finally and similarly, HUD has not achieved the right balance of contracting&amp;nbsp;support and in-house expertise to manage the agency’s data and systems effectively and affordably.


Over the next four years, HUD aims to leverage these opportunities by enhancing the quality, availability,&amp;nbsp;and delivery of HUD information to citizens, employees, business partners, and the government, while&amp;nbsp;striving for excellence in IT management practices and governance to consolidate and streamline HUD’s&amp;nbsp;systems. In pairing enhanced technology and improved processes with a developing and strengthening&amp;nbsp;workforce, the department expects to vastly broaden its ability to achieve current and future departmental&amp;nbsp;goals.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Office of the Chief Information Officer</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>The Department made strides through a data governance working group to develop a strong data governance structure working toward master data management - including the&amp;nbsp;initial HUD Data Model which was published in February.&amp;nbsp;We also made significant IT infrastructure progress though the implementation of Office 365, the initiation of a new mobile devices pilot, and the establishment of a new enterprise solution for Customer Relationship Management (CRM). While the number of IT systems increased by 12 from FY 2014, the cost decreased by over $22 million.
