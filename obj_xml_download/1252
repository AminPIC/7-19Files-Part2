</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>BLM, FWS, NPS, BIA</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>The Department’s protection of cultural and heritage resources has held steady with a slight uptrend over the 5-year period of 2011 to 2015 for archaeological sites, historic structures, and museum collections. The percentage of archaeological sites in good condition increased from 64 percent to 65 percent, and the percentage of historic structures in good condition increased from 54 percent to 65 percent. &amp;nbsp;Incremental improvements in efficiencies and processes resulted in gradual increases of assets brought into good condition.&amp;nbsp; Beginning in 2014, data reported for museum collections is different from earlier years due to implementation of a revised definition of a collection.

The Department exceeded its target for 2015 for historic structures in good condition. The National Park Service completed a large number of additional assessments of historic structures in 2015.&amp;nbsp; Fortunately, most of these newly assessed structures were found to be in good condition leading to a significant increase (from 13,400 to 16,373) in the number of structures in good condition. (NPS manages almost 90 percent of all DOI historic structures.)&amp;nbsp;
