</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>ONRR disburses mineral and renewable energy revenues to a number of entities.&amp;nbsp; Distributions to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the Historic Preservation Fund, and the Reclamation Fund help ensure America’s natural resources, landscapes, and rich history are available to be enjoyed by current and future generations.&amp;nbsp; Distributions to states are used to fund large capital projects such as schools, roads, and public buildings.&amp;nbsp; Revenues collected from leases on Indian lands work directly to benefit members of the Indian community.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>ONRR</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>The Department of the Interior, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, has highlighted this objective as a focus area for improvement.&amp;nbsp; The Department collects, disburses and verifies Federal and Indian energy and other natural resource revenue on behalf of the American public through the Office of Natural Resource Revenue (ONNR).&amp;nbsp; ONNR continues to maintain a high level of achievement for timely disbursement of Federal and Indian revenues, with performance targets averaging 98% over the past 5 years.&amp;nbsp; ONRR also performs compliance activities to ensure the Department collects revenue due from oil and gas produced on Federal lands and waters.&amp;nbsp; ONRR is expanding data mining, training and system functionality to improve upfront compliance, as part of its ongoing efforts to improve company compliance and in support of Interior’s effort to resolve recommendations cited on the GAO High Risk List for oil and gas resources management. &amp;nbsp;

The FY 2015 result for Percent of Revenues Timely Disbursed Per Statute exceeded the target despite significant decreases in market prices for oil and gas. &amp;nbsp;These unforeseen market fluctuations had a minor impact on total collections and the return on investment, however, improvements in upfront compliance enabled ONRR to exceed the planned disbursement rate.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>As manager of one-fifth of the Nation’s landmass and energy resources on 1.7 billion acres of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), the Department plays a critical role in meeting America’s energy needs and moving the Nation toward a clean energy future.  The Department’s lands and waters provide 30 percent of the Nation’s domestically-produced energy.  We are creating a New Energy Frontier, responsibly advancing renewable energy on the Nation’s lands and waters, and supporting tribal communities in the development of conventional and renewable energy resources and non-energy mineral resources on trust land.
