</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>The USGS works with its many partners to characterize the potential impact and consequences of natural hazard events on human activity, health, the economy, and the environment.&amp;nbsp; The USGS supports national and global monitoring capabilities and long-term investigations of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides and geomagnetic storms.&amp;nbsp; Timely and relevant data, maps and assessments are provided to support emergency response and decrease loss of life and property due to a wide range of natural hazards.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>USGS</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>In FY 2015, 13 of 14 performance measures met or exceeded their targets due to an increase in funding.&amp;nbsp; Specifically, the Volcano Hazards Program purchased and installed new monitoring equipment; the Earthquake Hazards Program increased work on induced seismicity and analyzed data from new, low-cost seismic instrumentation; and the Geomagnetism Program improved observatory equipment which resulted in the collection ofmore and higher reliability data. &amp;nbsp;This level of performance indicates that critical natural hazard knowledge and tools are being developed and provided to land managers and policy makers to inform decision making.

The only measure that did not meet its target was the amount of Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) data collected for the Coastal and Marine Geology Program.&amp;nbsp; No data was collected in FY 2015 because the USGS Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar (EAARL-B) instrument was not operable due to coolant leaks and a lack of spare parts. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
