</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>Preparing workers for better jobs is fundamental to enacting the Secretary’s vision of promoting and protecting opportunity. Investing in workers and empowering them to earn the skills they need to succeed in durable, sustainable careers is one way the Labor Department contributes to President Obama’s plan to rebuild the middle class. To grow the economy from the middle out, workers need the opportunity to equip themselves with the right competencies and employers need access to a skilled domestic workforce required to compete in a 21st century global economy. While the Department serves all workers, it maintains a focus on the hardest to serve populations, assuring that these groups expand their economic opportunities and do not get left behind. The Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB) protects opportunities for American businesses and workers to compete on a level playing field internationally, by working to improve worker rights and livelihoods for vulnerable populations across the globe.
