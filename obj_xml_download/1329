</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>The Department is committed to upholding the civil and constitutional rights of all Americans, including the most vulnerable members of society.&amp;nbsp; Federal civil rights statutes reflect some of America’s highest ideals and aspirations – equal treatment and equal justice under law.&amp;nbsp; These statutes not only aim to protect the civil rights of racial and ethnic minorities, but also of members of religious minorities, women, persons with disabilities, service members, individuals housed in public institutions, and individuals who come from other nations and speak other languages.&amp;nbsp; The Department will enforce, defend, and advance civil rights through a multi-faceted approach of litigation, prevention efforts, outreach initiatives, and technical assistance.&amp;nbsp; The Department will work with the Congress, other federal agencies and partnerships, as well as through legislative, regulatory, and policy development.&amp;nbsp; The Department addresses discrimination and promotes equal opportunity in a broad range of areas, including the workplace, schools and higher education institutions, housing, courts, prisons and detention facilities, police departments, and mental health facilities; in voting and immigration-related practices; and in institutions receiving federal financial assistance.&amp;nbsp; The Department also ensures that private institutions of public accommodation comport with applicable federal civil rights laws.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Civil Rights Division</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>Strategic Objective Review Summary of Findings: The Department of Justice, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, has determined that performance toward this objective is making Noteworthy Progress

In FY 2015, the Department continued its commitment to upholding the civil and constitutional rights of all Americans.&amp;nbsp; The Department successfully sought a 33-count indictment against Dylann Storm Roof, charging him with federal hate crimes under the Shepard-Byrd Act, as well as firearms charges, for killing and attempting to kill African-American parishioners at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina.&amp;nbsp; Also in FY 2015, DOJ issued a report on its investigation of the fatal shooting of Michael Brown by Officer Darren Wilson of the Ferguson, Missouri Police Department, finding that the evidence did not support federal civil rights charges against Officer Wilson.&amp;nbsp; DOJ issued a report on its pattern and practice investigation of the Ferguson Police Department and determined that the Ferguson Police Department engages in a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the United States Constitution and federal law.&amp;nbsp; DOJ found that this unconstitutional conduct stems from the interaction of two dynamics:&amp;nbsp; Ferguson’s undue focus on revenue generation through policing and pervasive racial bias in the police department and court system.

The Department also reached an agreement with Leflore County, Mississippi, to improve security and facility conditions at the Leflore County Juvenile Detention Center.&amp;nbsp; In the agreement, Leflore County committed to numerous reforms to protect children in its care from abuse and self-harm.

In July 2015, the Department went to trial in a lawsuit against the State of North Carolina over voting rules signed into law in August 2013.&amp;nbsp; The North Carolina law includes troubling new voting restrictions, such as provisions that will significantly reduce early voting days; eliminate same-day registration during early voting; and prohibit the counting of otherwise legitimate provisional ballots that are mistakenly cast in the right county but in the wrong precinct.

The Department also sued three separate owners or servicers of private and federally guaranteed student loans (collectively, “Sallie Mae”) alleging that they violated the rights of service members eligible for benefits and protections under the Service Members Civil Relief Act.&amp;nbsp; In May 2015, the Department announced that Sallie Mae was distributing $60 million in compensation to over 70,000 service members for the alleged violations and $55,000 to the United States as a civil penalty.

The Department will continue to devote substantial resources to address unconstitutional policing practices throughout the country; seek additional opportunities to educate workers and employers about the anti-discrimination provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act; protect students from sexual harassment through compliance reviews, outreach, technical assistance, and litigation; expand the Department’s already successful human trafficking program; and continue to analyze successful outcomes from past cases to develop best practices for encouraging effective and accountable policing.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>The Department embraces its historic role in keeping America safe by fighting crime, protecting civil rights, preserving the environment, ensuring fairness in the market place, and defending and representing the interests of the United States.  Accordingly, Goal 2 encompasses what is viewed as the traditional missions of DOJ: enforcing and upholding federal law.
 
From the violent gangs in our cities and suburbs, to sophisticated financial fraud schemes that threaten the financial security of all citizens, to the flow of drugs across the Southwest Border and the associated violent crime, the Department’s law enforcement mission is as complex and varied as it has ever been in its history.  Goal 2 covers this broad range of law enforcement issues, including violent crime, illegal drugs, criminal gangs, and gun violence.  It includes white collar crimes, such as health care fraud, corporate fraud, and public corruption.  It also includes computer crime, identity theft, IP crime, and other kinds of crime facilitated by computer networks.  In addition, it covers the exploitation of vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly.  This goal also includes enforcing federal civil and criminal statutes that protect civil rights, safeguard the environment, preserve a competitive market structure, and preserve the integrity of the Nation’s bankruptcy system.
 
Goal 2 addresses the role of the Department as the Nation’s largest law office and chief litigator, which involves representing hundreds of United States’ agencies, offices, and employees and defending against myriad challenges to federal laws, programs, and policies.  This work is critical to protecting the federal fisc against unwarranted monetary claims and to ensuring the United States can continue to protect the Nation’s security, maintain civil law and order, and enhance public safety.
