</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview></Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Office of Management</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>Educational institutions rely on student data to improve decision-making, to personalize learning, and to target additional support to at-risk students, and the Department itself relies on student data for key administration initiatives. Increases in the collection and use of student data, however, have fueled public concern about student privacy, and important gains are at risk due to public concern. Throughout FY 2015, student privacy was an extremely hot topic and as a result the Department had to begin, to some degree, pulling away from our long term improvement plans to respond to immediate Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and privacy issues providing substantial, recurring technical assistance to the Hill on dozens of proposed bills dealing with student privacy. In addition, the Department responded to public and congressional criticism over the privacy of students’ medical treatment records in the wake of a recent sexual assault case by issuing a draft Dear Colleague letter on the protection of student privacy in campus medical records. The Department was publicly commended for publishing the letter in draft format, to obtain public input before finalizing it in FY 2016.

While adjusting to these changing demands, there has been consistent, steady improvement in office metrics specific to privacy since we began tracking these numbers about two years ago. Our strategy has been to rely when appropriate on contractor resources, both within the office and from the contractors that staff the PTAC. These efforts in addressing the high degree of public interest in student privacy included the implementation of a new more user-friendly website, and the release of our Model Terms of Service guidance and teacher training video. Another strategy that continues to pay off is increased coordination with other Department offices engaged in privacy technical assistance as the Department expanded PTAC’s work to include early childhood programs, particularly through the creation of new online resource page that curates a vast array of technical assistance resources on the privacy and security of early childhood (EC) data from across the Department’s disparate EC technical assistance centers. Through PTAC and the Department’s Office of the Chief Privacy Officer (OCPO), the Department conducted a number of targeted technical assistance activities on early childhood issues, including a site visits, webinars, and workshops and provided extensive internal technical assistance on privacy issues relating to the Preschool Development Grants program. As a result of this focus on efficiencies and resource utilization, using metrics to improve performance and relying on a case tracking system that manages workload and content for both our contractor and federal staff, the average time to respond to cases was under 5 days, meeting the Department’s FY 2015 performance target of by having an average turnaround time of less than 8 days.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Achieving the president’s 2020 college attainment goal will require better and stronger systems, powered by reliable and usable information that informs decision making, as well as by innovation.  Through this strategic plan, the Department aims to foster a culture of continuous systems improvement at the national, state, and local levels.  To achieve this goal, the Department will support robust and comprehensive data systems that produce timely, relevant, and understandable information while properly protecting student privacy; strategic use of research, evaluation, and  evidence in decision making at all levels; increased innovation; and effective and systemic use of technology.
 
The foundation for improving systemic capacity is an infrastructure that supports data-driven decision making.  Stakeholders must have access to relevant, useful data in a timely fashion, and the skills to better understand and make use of the data.  With relevant and actionable data and the ability to use it, policymakers and educators will be able to appraise how states, districts, schools, and students are currently performing; measure progress; pinpoint gaps; improve practice; better address student needs; and make sound decisions.  States are developing systems that will yield the valid, reliable data that are essential to achieving these purposes, but there is much more work to do.  The Department will continue helping states develop effective statewide longitudinal data systems, design voluntary common data standards to increase interoperability, and develop the capacity of institutions and staff to utilize data to improve teaching and learning.  These activities will help to generate an accurate picture of student performance and other critical elements, from early learning programs through postsecondary institutions and the workforce. At the same time, the Department will work through the government-wide Open Data Initiative to ensure that its own information and data are accessible to and useable by researchers, analysts, and developers in the general public.
 
Of course, the collection and use of data must be responsible and must appropriately protect student privacy.  Stewards and users of data must remember that data describe real people and ensure that systems protect the rights of those people. But there is no need to sacrifice data-driven decision making to protect student privacy, and the Department will help practitioners in the field ensure they are properly protecting privacy, and communicating with parents and students about the proper use and management of student data.
Systemic improvement also requires research and evaluation so that decision makers at the national, state, and local levels have reliable evidence to inform their actions. The Department aims to support research that will make a difference by giving states, districts, and schools the information and evidence they need to identify the effective practices they need to adopt. This research will also help them focus scarce resources on investments most likely to have the greatest impact and become more dynamic learning organizations.  In service of this, the Department will use its programmatic and research activities to incentivize the creation and use of evidence by stakeholders in the field. In addition, the Department will use evidence to inform its own policymaking and program development, and will work to communicate the findings of its research and evaluation activities to the field in an engaging and relevant way, further increasing their impact.
The goals and actions in this strategic plan sharpen the focus on the need to generate bold and creative solutions, and aim to support innovation in partnership with other federal partners and private organizations with related missions.  The Department will continue to stimulate innovations in education and provide funds needed to accelerate their design and adoption.  It also will work with Congress to fill a gap in the research and development landscape by establishing an advanced research projects agency for education to pursue breakthrough developments in ways not possible using existing Department mechanisms.
 
The Department’s vision for 21st-century learning also requires that schools have a 21st -century technology infrastructure, anchored around high-speed Internet. States, districts, and schools must have such infrastructure to incorporate cutting-edge methods for strengthening curriculum quality and delivery to meet more rigorous college- and career-ready standards; improving student access and engagement; developing comprehensive, formative, and summative assessment systems; and enhancing data management systems.
How will we measure success?  
 
The Department will use the following indicators to measure its success in enhancing the U.S. education system’s ability to continuously improve through better and more widespread use of data, research and evaluation, evidence, transparency, innovation, and technology.

What could hold us back?  What’s beyond our control?  (External Risk Factors)
 
Efforts to ensure that robust, integrated data systems are linked with early childhood, postsecondary, and workforce-level data will be constrained by the amount of time, financial resources, and support available to states to carry out this work.  State and local funding for data systems may be reduced due to continued budgetary pressures at all levels.  Moreover, wide variations in the various data systems present unique challenges for each state.  Some district data systems, for example, far surpass their own state’s data system.  Efforts to ensure that data systems lead to data-driven decision making may also encounter obstacles around privacy concerns that will need to be addressed.
 
The implementation of these strategies depends on the availability of resources for evaluation and research, which are typically more difficult to obtain than resources for services and program implementation.  In addition, many of the activities supporting this goal will be carried out by contractors and grantees, and thus are, in part, dependent on the capacity and quality of research expertise that exists outside the Department.  This variance in capacity may be more pronounced when it comes to interpreting and using evidence to drive decision making. Similarly, the evidence base regarding interventions in some areas is more robust than in others. And some grant programs focus on areas with less-developed evidence bases. At least in the short term, this could affect the amount of Department funding tied to the existence of certain levels of evidence for projects. Additionally, there are the perceived and real challenges states and districts face in implementing programs in ways that can support the strongest possible studies and evaluations of those programs. Some of these challenges can be addressed through Departmental technical assistance, but others may arise.
 
As reflected by Strategic Objective 5.2, one ongoing challenge is to protect privacy while increasing accessibility to relevant information. For its part, the Department will continue to vigilantly safeguard all personally identifiable information while also helping education agencies make useful information available. The Department also will help stakeholders develop best practices in protecting privacy while still driving data-driven decision making. But no system is perfect, and concerns about privacy may deter stakeholders from embracing the use of data, regardless of the actual level of risk presented.  Another risk lies in finding the right balance of information as too much information could make it nearly impossible to find meaning within data. To avoid this problem, the Department must work with stakeholders to prioritize information and to determine what is most likely to help families make choices for their children, help teachers improve student learning, and enable decision makers to improve education institutions.
 
Education funding faces tremendous budgetary pressure across the country, putting investment in new programs, strategies, or processes at risk.  In this time of decreasing budgets, technology infrastructure and other innovations might be seen as luxuries rather than as mission critical.  Because the private sector currently does not find investment in education innovation as attractive as investment in innovation in other sectors, there is limited private funding to help bridge the gaps.  And the promise of technology might be affected by variance in the capacity of states, districts, and schools to plan, implement, and support modern technology networks.
 
[1] “New competitive grant dollars that reward evidence” includes all dollars awarded based on the existence of at least “evidence of promise” in support of a project, per the framework in the Education Department General Administrative Regulations (34 CFR Part 75). Consideration of such evidence appears through: eligibility threshold (e.g., in the Investing in Innovation program); absolute priority; competitive priority (earning at least one point for it); or selection criteria (earning at least one point for it). The percentage is calculated compared to the total new grant dollars awarded, excluding awards made by the Institute of Education Sciences, the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research, and technical assistance centers, with some exceptions.
