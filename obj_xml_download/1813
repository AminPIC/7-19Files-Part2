</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>The Indian Affairs Irrigation Program conducts irrigation construction, dam rehabilitation, and oversight (operation and maintenance) of dams, irrigation, and power projects on trust lands to ensure effective water and power distribution. The Program sets high standards for maintenance of irrigation systems to prevent risk to lives and property.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>BIA</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>The Department expanded the scope of BIAâ€™s Water Management, Planning and Pre-development program to cover over 5,000 linear miles of irrigation project canals.&amp;nbsp; Many of the Indian irrigation projects have antiquated systems in need of major repairs and upgrades, in addition to some irrigation canal projects that never were completed.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Consequently, every year BIA funds projects to address unfinished projects as well as current and deferred maintenance issues to ensure irrigation canals are capable of delivering water to tribal customers.&amp;nbsp; The BIA continues assessments of the current infrastructure through condition assessments, GPS inventories and GIS mapping tools to move toward improved tribal irrigation projects in the future.&amp;nbsp; In FY 2015, the target was exceeded as a result of good weather conditions.&amp;nbsp;
