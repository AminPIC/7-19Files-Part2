</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>A skilled and adaptable workforce is critical to U.S. global competitiveness and sustainable economic growth. &amp;nbsp;An employer-aligned, (i.e., demand-driven) comprehensive approach to skills development is essential to helping businesses across all sectors better access skilled workers to grow, innovate, and be more productive. &amp;nbsp;A skills strategy focused on industry-driven solutions helps address the difficulties many industries, particularly manufacturing, have in filling jobs requiring specific technical skills—even with many Americans still looking for work.

&amp;nbsp;

The Department is an honest broker for business and possesses the convening power, regional economic development expertise, and supply-chain-need analytical capability to highlight and address the workforce demands of growing industries. &amp;nbsp;In addition to supporting a National Economic Council-led effort to align federal agency initiatives to better serve industry demands, the Department programs will to the creation of a &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;strong pipeline of workers with in-demand skills.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office></Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>During FY 2014, the Department of Commerce (DOC) successfully undertook various efforts to reduce the gap between the workforce needs of employers and the supply of workers with in-demand skills.&amp;nbsp; By making its workforce-related data more accessible, emphasizing an ecosystem approach to workforce-related interagency coordination, and stressing the importance of aligning workforce development and economic development, DOC began to establish itself as industry’s resource for input into the Administration’s job-driven skills training agenda.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

Accomplishments include:

&amp;nbsp;


	The Department contributed to other federal agencies’ workforce-related funding opportunities to make sure employer expectations are considered during the development of grant opportunities.
	EDA, ESA, and NIST contributed to the interagency Job-Driven Checklist to give value to and clarify the needs of business in workforce development.
	EDA economic development grants made in FY 2014 to help communities and regions build the capacity to support job driven workforce skills are, according to recipients, estimated to create and/or retain approximately 2,900 jobs and result in $539M in private investment.
	EDA established a “job-driven skills development” investment priority and included the job-driven principles in the new Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy (CEDS) Content Guidelines to increase awareness of the importance of industry-led workforce development.
	EDA completed a draft of the Regional Partnership for Talent Development Federal Funding Opportunity (FFO) to establish a series of learning exchanges to promote regional workforce ecosystems.
	MFG Day, co-produced by NIST Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP), Fabricators and Manufacturers Association, National Association of Manufacturers, The Manufacturing Institute, along with the Science Channel and Shell Oil, showcased nation-wide activities, open houses and events to interest the public in manufacturing and the importance the industry plays in the U.S. economy. On October 3, 2014, more than 1600 events took place across the county in support of MFG day and providing manufacturers an opportunity to highlight their industry.
	NIST incorporated the Job-Driven Checklist in a funding opportunity that began a systematic re-competition of its MEP centers.
	Twelve NIST-MEP centers began pilot testing the SMARTalent tool to understand the workforce needs of client-users and is positioned to share data with local workforce stakeholders (e.g., community colleges).
	DOC, Office of Science and Technology Policy, and Department of Labor partnered with technology leaders to put better career information and career connections in the hands of today’s and tomorrow’s job seekers through a series of data jams.
	Census completed a significant redesign of the OnTheMap application reports to make it easier for users to analyze workforce data.
	The National Advisory Council on Innovation and Entrepreneurship (NACIE) was repositioned to emphasize board membership that highlights successful industry-led skills/workforce development strategies.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Innovation is the invention, improvement, and commercialization of new products, processes, and services.  Now, more than ever before, innovation is the primary driver of U.S. competitiveness, wage and job growth, and long-term economic growth.  As much as half of economic growth in the United States can be attributed to advances in science, technology, and business processes.
 
Innovation is the result of a virtuous cycle where initial advancements in technology and processes often lead to additional technology and process improvements, as well as positive industry spillovers.  It starts with the generation of new ideas that are nurtured through applied research and development (R&amp;amp;D) and then manufactured to take those ideas to scale and generate new products and services.  The experience and knowledge gained through manufacturing then leads to new ideas that start the cycle again.  The Department has central responsibility for supporting and expanding each part of this cycle and has the relationships with businesses necessary to identify workforce skills needed in growing industries.
 
Innovative manufacturing can be an engine of sustained growth and competitiveness.  The Department will increase regional and national capacity for innovative manufacturing through partnerships with state and local governments, academic institutions, and the private sector.  It will continue to be the principal defender and champion of the digital economy—the greatest driver of innovation and economic growth in the 21st century.  The Department’s convening power, regional economic development planning know-how, and statistical and economic analysis expertise will enable industry-driven solutions to the shortage of high demand skills.  Finally, the Department will continue to support R&amp;amp;D that leads to transformative changes in technology and promote intellectual property policy that supports innovation.
