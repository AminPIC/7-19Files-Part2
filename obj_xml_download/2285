U.S. investments that result in healthier people make for stronger, more prosperous, and more stable countries; they enhance international security and trade; and they ensure a safer, more resilient America.&amp;nbsp; Despite successes in addressing health challenges in recent decades, in some places progress remains far too slow.&amp;nbsp; Much remains to be done to strengthen health systems in developing countries and address HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and maternal and child mortality.&amp;nbsp; In 2012, 6.6 million children under the age of five died, many from preventable causes.&amp;nbsp; Infectious, life-threatening diseases such as pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria are exacerbated by malnutrition and poor access to health services.&amp;nbsp; Infectious disease outbreaks, whether naturally caused, intentionally produced, or accidentally released, remain among the foremost dangers to human health and the global economy. &amp;nbsp;Many countries have limited capacity to prevent, detect, and rapidly respond to these threats.

Strategies for Achieving the Objective

The U.S. government has more than 10 years of experience in helping countries to rapidly expand HIV prevention, treatment, and care services through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). PEPFAR's current strategy, PEPFAR 3.0 - Controlling the Epidemic: Delivering on the Promise of an AIDS-Free Generation, showcases PEPFAR’s design to support the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)ambitious 90-90-90 global goals: 90 percent of all people living with HIV will know their HIV status; 90 percent of all people with diagnosed HIV infection will receive sustained antiretroviral therapy; and 90 percent of all people receiving antiretroviral therapy will have viral suppression by 2020.&amp;nbsp; This new focus requires a shift in business practices, pivoting to a data-driven approach that strategically targets geographical areas and populations where we can achieve the most impact for our investments.&amp;nbsp; The PEPFAR 3.0 strategy makes clear that the United States' commitment to this goal will remain strong, comprehensive, and driven by science. Importantly, this framework emphasizes impact, efficiency, sustainability, partnership, and human rights as core agendas to create an AIDS-free generation.

In 2012, the U.S. government joined more than 175 countries and 400 civil society and faith organizations in pledging to end preventable child deaths worldwide by 2035, as part of the Call to Action for Child Survival. &amp;nbsp;The Call to Action joins related efforts that have set ambitious goals to end preventable maternal and newborn deaths, increase access to voluntary family planning, and accelerate improvements in malaria, nutrition, and water and sanitation. &amp;nbsp;These renewed efforts have spurred strategic shifts in maternal and child health programming including: &amp;nbsp;increasing efforts in those countries with the largest share of under-five deaths, focusing on reaching the most underserved populations, targeting the drivers of mortality through innovation and scalable interventions, and creating mutual accountability at all levels.

The Ebola outbreak in West Africa is a jarring reminder of the need for a greater capability in all countries to rapidly detect and respond to new or re-emerging public health threats that “spill over” in humans from animal populations. &amp;nbsp;The Global Health Security agenda is an effort between the U.S. government, other nations, international organizations and public and private stakeholders, to accelerate progress toward a world safe and secure from infectious disease threats and to promote global health security as an international security priority. &amp;nbsp;The State Department, along with other U.S. government agencies, contributes to global health security by strengthening policies related to dual-use research of concern.

The U.S. government will use its influence in multilateral and bilateral arenas to focus attention on accelerating achievement of U.S. global health objectives and the UN Millennium Development Goals. Continued diplomatic leadership on global health in the UN Post-2015 Development Agenda will remain a U.S. priority. &amp;nbsp;Supported by the State Department and USAID, our diplomats and development professionals will promote country-owned health systems and encourage shared responsibility for financing health systems with partner governments, other donors, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector. &amp;nbsp;Although U.S. positions on health in the Post-2015 Development Agenda have yet to be finalized, they will likely include a focus on creating an AIDS-free generation and ending preventable child and maternal deaths. &amp;nbsp;The U.S. government is also considering incorporating new areas such as non-communicable diseases and a multi-sectoral focus on health system strengthening in the Post-2015 development goals.

Many external factors affect U.S. government efforts on country ownership and shared responsibility. &amp;nbsp;A successful transition to country ownership depends on political stewardship by partner governments and the administrative and technical capabilities of numerous public and private institutions. &amp;nbsp;Fiscal pressures on traditional donor countries will likely continue to negatively affect their ability to support multilateral initiatives. Steady economic growth in many regions, and particularly in Africa, will create opportunities for countries to direct more domestic resources toward their health sectors.

The U.S. government, through the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005 and newly-signed Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2014, is committed to using its foreign assistance resources to help people and countries have reliable and sustainable access to an acceptable quantity and quality of water to meet their needs.&amp;nbsp; USAID supports increased access to reliable and sustainable water supply and sanitation through funding for infrastructure development and through institutional and capacity development, strengthening of community-based systems, facilitation of private supply of products and services, improved management and governance, and mobilization of additional financing.&amp;nbsp;
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Bureau for Global Health (USAID)</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>The Department of State and USAID have determined that performance towards this objective is making noteworthy progress.

Ending Preventable Child and Maternal Deaths (EPCMD):

The world has made remarkable strides in both public and private efforts toward saving the lives of women and children, yet maternal and child mortality remains a critical problem in developing countries.&amp;nbsp; Child deaths decreased by 46 percent from 1990 to 2012, and maternal deaths decreased by 45 percent from 1990 to 2013.&amp;nbsp; While these global mortality declines since 1990 are impressive, recent estimates indicate that each year more than 289,000 women still die from complications during pregnancy or childbirth and there are still 6.3 million deaths of children under five years of age – 43 percent of which are in the first month of life. &amp;nbsp;Approximately three-quarters of these child and maternal deaths are preventable with currently available interventions.

Together with country partners, international organizations, and nongovernmental organizations from around the globe, the United States is working toward targets that will truly represent an end to preventable child deaths––with all countries having fewer than 20 deaths per 1,000 live births and fewer than 50 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births by 2035.&amp;nbsp; The related Agency Priority Goal is to reduce under-five mortality by 4 deaths per 1,000 live births in our priority countries by the end FY 2015 (as compared to FY 2013).

Improvements in mortality outcomes are the result of increasingly effective efforts to link diverse health programs in maternal and child health, malaria, family planning’s contribution to the healthy timing and spacing of pregnancy, nutrition, HIV/AIDS, and sanitation and hygiene improvement.&amp;nbsp; All of these efforts contribute to ending preventable child and maternal deaths.

The U.S. government cannot achieve these goals alone.&amp;nbsp; To achieve this objective the U.S. must encourage country ownership and invest in country-led plans while continuing to challenge the global community to support this global goal.&amp;nbsp; The U.S. government approach works with partner countries to address these primary drivers by building sustainable health systems that can address the full range of developing country health needs.

On June 25, 2014, USAID and the Governments of Ethiopia and India, in collaboration with United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and other partners, came together for a high-level forum:&amp;nbsp; Acting on the Call:&amp;nbsp; Ending Preventable Child and Maternal Deaths, to celebrate the progress, assess the challenges that remain, and identify the steps needed to sustain momentum in the future.

To accelerate efforts toward this goal, in FY 2014, USAID is providing over $2 billion, with the bulk of the resources going toward the 24 priority countries where the majority of child and maternal deaths occur.&amp;nbsp; USAID continues to work to ensure that our programs and budgets are focused on the key drivers of child and maternal deaths and to support state-of-the-art, evidence-based programs to ensure we meet our goals.

Shared Responsibility – Strengthen Results for an AIDS-Free Generation:

PEPFAR represents America’s commitment to saving lives, controlling the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and working with our partners to achieve an AIDS-free generation.&amp;nbsp; Reaching the goal of an AIDS-free generation is a shared responsibility among host country governments, civil society, faith-based organizations, development partners, multilateral organizations, the private sector, and others.&amp;nbsp; PEPFAR remains firmly committed to its foundational principles of making smart investments based on sound science, good public health, a human rights approach, and focusing on the accountability, transparency, and impact of our work. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

At the end of FY 2014, PEPFAR supported more than 7.7 million men, women, and children worldwide on life-saving antiretroviral therapy (ART).&amp;nbsp; In FY 2014, PEPFAR supported HIV testing and counseling (HTC) for more than 56.7 million people, providing a critical entry point to prevention, care and treatment.&amp;nbsp; Of those receiving PEPFAR-supported HTC, more than 14.2 million were pregnant women.&amp;nbsp; For the approximately 745,000 of these pregnant women who tested positive for HIV, PEPFAR provided antiretroviral medications for PMTCT.&amp;nbsp; In FY 2014 alone, due to PEPFAR support, 95 percent of these babies were born HIV-free (including 240,000 that would otherwise have been infected).&amp;nbsp; From FY 2013-14, more than 1.5 million HIV-positive pregnant women received these interventions to prevent mother-to-child transmission and improve maternal health. &amp;nbsp; By the end of calendar year 2014, PEPFAR supported a cumulative total of 6.5 million voluntary medical male circumcisions (VMMC) for HIV prevention procedures in east and southern Africa.&amp;nbsp; In FY 2014, PEPFAR also supported more than 17 million people with care and support, including 5 million orphans and vulnerable children.

To accelerate progress, PEPFAR is further increasing its efficiency and maximizing its impact.&amp;nbsp; This includes driving down the cost of commodities; employing the highest yield interventions and targeting specific geographic areas, populations, and risk behaviors; utilizing site-level and expenditure analysis data to rigorously monitor program impact; expanding HIV services access while maintaining high-quality care; and strengthening coordination with other donors, particularly the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, to reduce duplication, leverage our collective buying power, and optimize our combined efforts.

Water and Sanitation:&amp;nbsp;

USAID’s Water and Development Strategy sets the overall goal of saving lives and advancing development with the first strategic objective to improve health outcomes through improvements in water supply, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) programs.&amp;nbsp; USAID has set a target of reaching a minimum of 10 million persons with sustainable access to improved water supply and six million persons with sustainable access to improved sanitation over the period of 2013 - 2018.&amp;nbsp; The Strategy has added emphasis to sustainability, safe water, and sanitation.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Deploying diplomats and development experts on the frontlines today is cheaper than deploying troops tomorrow.  This is why we are acting on several fronts to make investments that strengthen the impact of America’s foreign policy on our greatest strategic challenges.  We know the difference that the United States can make around the world, and we must continue to deliver diplomatic, security, development, and humanitarian solutions that match the scale of the challenges we face.
The challenges we face are great, many, and span the globe.  Whether it be providing care and treatment for HIV/AIDS and malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, strengthening judicial institutions in Latin America, building trust and combating extremism in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or joining with our European partners to deliver humanitarian assistance where disaster strikes, the United States is at work in every region of the world.  In all that we do, we are partnering with the United Nations and other international organizations, whose cooperation is critical to our success.
While the men and women of the Department of State and USAID are active worldwide, a few strategic challenges are singled out in this report because they exemplify our commitment to building performance capabilities and to measuring and reporting on our performance.  These challenges are:  building a new stability in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA); rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific; preventing and responding to crises and conflict, and providing humanitarian assistance to those in need; and combating challenges to global security and health.
Success in building a new stability in the MENA region is essential to U.S. global interests.  The region is in the midst of transition and crisis, and poses some of the most immediate challenges for U.S. national security.  The United States “rebalance” to the Asia-Pacific reflects a profound recognition that the security and prosperity of our nation will be shaped by developments in that region.  Home to two-thirds of the world’s people and many of its fastest growing economies, the Asia-Pacific presents both opportunities and challenges for U.S. strategic and economic interests.  A transatlantic renaissance in relations with European allies and partners is essential to successfully confronting global challenges, as well as shaping and defending international institutions and norms in line with our shared, democratic, free-market values.
In addition, more than 1.5 billion people worldwide live in fragile or conflict-affected states, or in countries trapped in cycles of violence.  When states cannot control their territory, protect their people, support sustainable growth, or help those in need, the resulting instability disrupts economic activity and fosters permissive environments for violent extremists and weapons proliferation. 
We must meet these and other global security and health challenges that affect international stability and prosperity, and threaten U.S. interests.  These challenges include securing the world’s most dangerous weapons; investing in rule of law; securing borders and combating transnational organized crime; and countering cyber threats.  And we must continue to work with bilateral and multilateral partners to strengthen health systems in developing countries, create an AIDS-free generation, end preventable child and maternal deaths, and reduce the threat of infectious diseases.

The health of mothers and children around the world is linked to improvements in maternal health, which inherently affect child health. Over the past two decades, there has been a nearly 50 percent reduction in maternal deaths, from 543,000 in 1990 to 287,000 in 2010. Meanwhile, the annual number of under-five deaths declined from 12.6 million in 1990 to 6.6 million in 2012. While under-five mortality is declining faster now than in the past two decades, with the annual rate of reduction more than tripling in 2005-2012 compared to the rate in 1990-1995, 18,000 children still die every day. The U.S. cannot act alone and in order to meet the Millennium Development Goal Four (Reduce Child Mortality) target by its agreed date of 2015, an additional 3.5 million children's lives above the current trend rate will need to be saved between 2013 and 2015.
