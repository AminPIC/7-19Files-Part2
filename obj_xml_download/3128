Strategies:


	Design space, maintain offices, and reassess the structure of internal facilities to optimize resources and maximize opportunities for improved service delivery; and
	Explore solutions that optimize the operational efficiencies of offices, including co-locations.

</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Office of Budget, Finance, Quality and Management with the Office of Operations</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>We took the following steps in FY 2015 to evaluate our physical footprint to incorporate improved service options (see Key Initiatives and Performance Measures for more details):


	Reduced our usable square feet by 1.34 million from our FY 2012 level.


Next Steps


	Assess 100 percent of all field office and hearing office new lease actions for possible colocation opportunities;
	Create shared services-claimant only video rooms in field offices to increase hearing capacity without increasing the footprint;
	Continue building judge only video rooms in existing hearing offices to increase hearing capacity without the need to build additional hearing rooms; and
	Increase the number of colocations between hearing offices and field offices.

Our goal is to achieve even greater success in customer service and satisfaction through innovative online self-service options.  Each year, we see greater acceptance of technology across all demographic segments and a stronger preference for doing business online.  In particular, Internet use by seniors continues to rise.  To capitalize on this trend, we will increase the number of services we offer online and will communicate more with our customers online.
Because of the complexities of the programs we administer, we will provide customer support for our online services for times when customers need advice or assistance.  In keeping with the Administration’s one-government approach, we will partner with other agencies and community organizations to offer access to more government services online through increasing use of video servcies and the implementation of Social Security Express to provide servive using self-service kiosks.
We will continue to adjust our physical office structure to reflect our online service emphasis.  However, we will remain mindful of the importance of continuing to provide in-person service for those customers whose business with us requires it.  Technology will not replace employees.  Instead, it will free them to handle the more complex workloads and the individuals who require in-person help.  It will also give our employees tools to help them handle increasingly varied and complex work.
