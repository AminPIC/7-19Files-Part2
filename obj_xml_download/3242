</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>Homeland security is achieved through a shared effort among all partners, from corporations to nonprofits and American families. Recent events, including the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill and Hurricane Sandy, highlight the fundamentally important relationship that DHS must foster and sustain with the private sector as well as state, local, tribal, territorial, and international partners. In addition, rapidly evolving or emerging operating domains such as cyberspace and the Arctic are demanding new approaches and models for how DHS partners to achieve homeland security objectives.

We will pursue the following strategies to enhance partnerships and outreach:


	Promote regional response capacity and civil support by coordinating and advancing federal interaction with state, local, tribal, and territorial governments and by pursuing the Whole Community approach to build and sustain national preparedness.
	Strengthen the ability of federal agencies to support homeland security missions by working with federal partners to ensure that Departmental roles, responsibilities, and interests are integrated with and incorporated into interagency activities.
	Expand and extend governmental, nongovernmental, domestic, and international partnerships by building a Department-wide Community of Practice to synchronize the identification of potential partnership opportunities, develop a repository of partnerships and best practices, and serve as a consultative body to inform the exploration and formation of new public-private partnerships.
	Further enhance the military-homeland security relationship by collaborating with the Department of Defense to pursue bilateral science and technology agreements; collaborate in information sharing and training; provide support for information systems Law Enforcement, and emergency and disaster response support; and develop international relationships.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>The Nation’s experiences in the years since September 11, 2001 highlight the importance of joining efforts across all levels of society and government into a common homeland security. In considering the evolution of the Department and the ever-changing environment in which it operates, we have identified several key, cross-cutting functional areas of focus for action within the Department that must be accomplished in order for it to successfully execute its core missions. These functions, and the critical activities associated with them, serve as the supporting foundation that underpins all homeland security missions.
These goals also support the Unity of Effort Initiative, which builds important linkages between the Department’s planning, programming, budgeting, and execution processes, ensuring that the Department invests and operates in a cohesive, unified fashion, and makes decisions that are transparent and collaborative to drive the Secretary’s strategic guidance to results.
