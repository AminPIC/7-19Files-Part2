</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office></Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>OPM’s commitment to excellent customer service extends to electronic platforms such as websites and other online resources. In FY 2015, OPM launched the Retirement Studio on the Human Resources University (HRU) website, a public-facing website with extra features for Federal Government employees. The HRU Retirement Studio provides access to retirement training, webcasts, videos, and other retirement resources for agency benefit officers and other Federal employees. OPM also hosted three virtual seminars—two seminars related to Federal employee and retiree benefits and one on a variety of Federal HR and human capital issues.&amp;nbsp; These virtual seminars provided important information to HR specialists across Government on policies and procedures that apply to throughout the employee and retiree lifecycle while reducing costs compared to in-person seminars.

&amp;nbsp;

In addition, OPM updated the USAJOBS Contact Us page. The updated page provides users with on-screen help text, based on the topic selected, thus reducing the need to generate support tickets. OPM’s Retirement Services also created a web-based moving toolkit to help annuitants think through decisions related to their OPM benefits prior to a move and conduct any relevant transactions after their move.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>OPM has a diverse set of customers that include Federal employees, retirees, Federal human resource professionals, Federal agencies, uninsured Americans, and job applicants. While it may not be possible to have a single approach to customer service to meet the diverse needs of such a wide range of customers, OPM’s customer-facing components stand to gain much from sharing information and strategies with one another. The bottom line is that OPM’s customers should expect a consistently high standard of service quality.  Achieving success in this area will go a long way toward establishing an OPM brand that we all can be proud of.
