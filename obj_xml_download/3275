	Developing and standardizing policies and procedures for all data governed by OPM.
	Establishing an internal and external governance structure overseeing data analysis.
	Setting an annual research agenda to focus attention on current and projected issues affecting the Federal workforce and the relevant data important to those issues.

</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office></Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>In FY 2015, OPM defined the structure and developed the strategy for the research governance board. In support of the governance structure, the agency hired a Senior Advisor on Research and Evaluation, created and established a network of analytic ambassadors, and drafted the charter. The next steps include securing approval for the governance board charter and preparing for publication.

&amp;nbsp;

The challenge was the development of a comprehensive standard operating procedure that would be applicable to both the research agenda and the partnerships. After a comprehensive review, OPM streamlined processes to develop a standard procedure that could be utilized for both the research agenda and partnerships.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>As the Federal governmentâ€™s HR leader, OPM designs and executes policies that touch all Federal agencies, their leaders, workers, applicants, retirees and survivors. As part of our mission, OPM collects, manages, and analyzes a range of HR data from a variety of sources. In an effort to optimize policy design and practices, OPM needs a cohesive structure to manage and integrate data across the agency and with external partners. This increased focus on data integration will enrich the data that OPM uses to support policy development and operations and enable OPM to contribute further to rigorous research and evaluations. While integrating data sets holds great potential for improving our knowledge base, we will also be vigilant with respect to the need to protect personally identifiable information in compliance with the law and accepted practice.
