</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office></Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>In FY 2015, OPM began to identify and inventory the analytic tools being used across the agency, supplementing a CIO list with information from a data analysis and analytic tool survey to establish baseline spending.&amp;nbsp; Working in collaboration with OPM’s newly established research ambassadors, the agency identified a community of data analysts across OPM.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, the goal team developed a survey to identify the analytic tools currently in use across OPM, measure user satisfaction with the tools, and explore what new analytic tools would be valuable to consider in the future.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>As the Federal government’s HR leader, OPM designs and executes policies that touch all Federal agencies, their leaders, workers, applicants, retirees and survivors. As part of our mission, OPM collects, manages, and analyzes a range of HR data from a variety of sources. In an effort to optimize policy design and practices, OPM needs a cohesive structure to manage and integrate data across the agency and with external partners. This increased focus on data integration will enrich the data that OPM uses to support policy development and operations and enable OPM to contribute further to rigorous research and evaluations. While integrating data sets holds great potential for improving our knowledge base, we will also be vigilant with respect to the need to protect personally identifiable information in compliance with the law and accepted practice.
