</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>
	Working with universities, other academic institutions, agencies and industry to access data sets and ensure that OPM is using the most current analytic methods.
	Developing work groups with agencies to assess the most commonly used data and information.
	Establishing a data analysis community of practice and standards through CHCO Council and HRLOB.
	Partnering with Think Tanks to share best practices and compare methods.

</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office></Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>OPM partnered with the Chief Human Capital Officer Council to establish the HRStat community of practice to identify commonly used data. Additionally, OPM partnered with the Good Government Group to collaborate on emerging research agendas and initiatives, allowing the agency to leverage an existing network to establish a data analysis community of practice that included Federal agencies, universities and non-profit organizations. OPM conducted a series of collaborative sessions with universities and other academic institutions to share ongoing and future research initiatives, analytic methods and emerging practices.

One challenge is the development of a standardized process and research agreement that covers the varying types of research arrangements (i.e., academic, private sector, industry, etc.) that OPM is interested in pursuing, and meets the Research Authority criteria, where applicable.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>As the Federal governmentâ€™s HR leader, OPM designs and executes policies that touch all Federal agencies, their leaders, workers, applicants, retirees and survivors. As part of our mission, OPM collects, manages, and analyzes a range of HR data from a variety of sources. In an effort to optimize policy design and practices, OPM needs a cohesive structure to manage and integrate data across the agency and with external partners. This increased focus on data integration will enrich the data that OPM uses to support policy development and operations and enable OPM to contribute further to rigorous research and evaluations. While integrating data sets holds great potential for improving our knowledge base, we will also be vigilant with respect to the need to protect personally identifiable information in compliance with the law and accepted practice.
