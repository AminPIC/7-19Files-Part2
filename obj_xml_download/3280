	Publishing OPM’s IT Strategic Plan.
	Delivering a framework for a set of standards that supports the entirety of the HR life cycle as documented in the Human Resources Line of Business (HRLOB) Business Reference Model (BRM) that recognizes and synergizes the technology and tools within OPM, Shared Service Centers, and industry.
	Establishing a culture of openness and trust throughout the HR IT community and among key federal stakeholder communities.
	Establishing a practice of transparent IT cost accounting throughout OPM.

</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Office of the Chief Information Officer</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>OPM published the HR Line of Business Strategic Framework, which builds upon the Chief Human Capital Officer&amp;nbsp;Council’s HRIT Future State Vision to create a common user experience across the Federal employee lifecycle using interoperable HR systems and data. The Strategic Framework enables the development of an integrated, Government-wide HRIT environment over the next 10 years.&amp;nbsp; The framework defines a role for the HR Line of Business in the policy development process in response to improved performance outcomes. The framework also increases engagement between the Shared Service Centers and policy owners to improve the centers’ ability to implement policies in a timely manner. The framework will also create a common experience for the Federal workforce.

&amp;nbsp;

OPM also kicked off an update to the Business Reference Model by holding sessions with the goal of creating a single Federal framework for defining the HR lifecycle. The updated Business Reference Model will provide an operational model to standardize HR processes, define the Category Management initiative’s human capital category&amp;nbsp;structure, and facilitate financial transparency through improved HR information technology spend categorization. Category management is a new, more strategic approach that will enable the Federal Government to “buy smarter” and more like a single enterprise.

&amp;nbsp;

OPM continued to take part in working group sessions with cross-agency subject matter experts to compile, reconcile, and validate a final set of 103 Talent Development business requirements. The working group is continuing to develop future trends, which will be added to the set of business requirements.&amp;nbsp; OPM published the Talent Development business requirements report in June 2015.

&amp;nbsp;

OPM facilitated collaborative working groups that resulted in a memo for OMB with actionable recommendations to improve the shared services environment in the areas of sustainable funding, talent acquisition, governance, and process standardization and policy oversight.

&amp;nbsp;

OPM experienced some challenges developing Service Level Agreements due to a lack of expertise. To mitigate the skills gap, OPM acquired a subscription service in April 2015 that will provide access to information about industry best practices and standards that can be used as benchmarks by OPM.

OPM, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, has determined that performance toward this strategy is making noteworthy progress.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>A significant portion of OPM’s budget is spent on information technology (IT). For the most part, these expenditures are dedicated to the development and support of information technology systems for specific HR business functions. The remainder of the expenditures support OPM’s workforce, such tools as email, calendaring, remote access, Internet access, file storage, etc. There is an opportunity to manage OPM’s IT systems more efficiently and effectively through the development and implementation of an OPM-wide IT strategy. Through this strategy, OPM can leverage IT capabilities in one program area to support other program areas, OPM, and the federal government.
Given the critical importance of information to human resource management, OPM should have a clear, unified IT strategy that will assure scarce resources dedicated to IT are being spent wisely and based on agency business priorities.
