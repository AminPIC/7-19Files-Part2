</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Office of the Chief Information Officer</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>The creation of several new positions is one result of the completion of phase one of the CIO reorganization, including the creation of an IT Project Management Office to oversee all CIO projects.&amp;nbsp; Dedicated IT project managers will support OPM business lines.&amp;nbsp; OPM incorporated the portfolio goals into the CIO leadership performance standards.

OPM continues to make strides in improving IT governance, such as reestablishing an Investment Review Board with an updated charter.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The agency established decision criteria for the selection of IT investments, and created the Health of IT dashboard to define a standard set of categories to review and report on such investments.

OPM completed the acquisition of a software solution that will be used to manage OPM’s Enterprise Architecture, including the documentation of the “as is” and definition of the “to be.”&amp;nbsp; Phase one of the rollout will include the creation of application and asset inventories.

OPM continued to work on improvements to IT security, transitioning security monitoring from Designated Security Officers in the program offices to Information System Security Officers centralized within IT Security and Privacy.&amp;nbsp; This remediated a Federal Information Security Management Act weakness identified during inspector general audits.&amp;nbsp; The centralization of the Information System Security Officers increases the consistency with which OPM monitors its systems.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In addition, the Security Operation Center worked with OPM’s Network Management to implement tactical steps to strengthen the agency’s security posture.&amp;nbsp; This included upgrades to tools used to monitor OPM’s network.&amp;nbsp; The agency also signed an agreement with DHS to implement the Continuous Diagnostic and Mitigation program.&amp;nbsp; This will be a multi-phase project with the first four controls implemented by the end of FY 2016.

OPM experienced multiple challenges in 2015.&amp;nbsp; The CIO reorganization took longer than expected, causing delays in re-aligning resources to support the implementation of the Strategic Plan.&amp;nbsp; The IT Strategic Plan called for the reallocation of existing manpower and other resources for IT governance.&amp;nbsp; While the CIO was able to complete the phase one reorganization, additional phases are still required to complete the realignment.

Further, due to the age of some OPM systems, the agency has been unable to meet all Federal Information Security Management Act requirements.

In addition, OPM discovered multiple intrusions resulting in breaches of OPM data.&amp;nbsp; These breaches created multiple challenges, including the need to shift resources and re-prioritize work.

OPM, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, has highlighted this strategy as a focus area for improvement.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>A significant portion of OPM’s budget is spent on information technology (IT). For the most part, these expenditures are dedicated to the development and support of information technology systems for specific HR business functions. The remainder of the expenditures support OPM’s workforce, such tools as email, calendaring, remote access, Internet access, file storage, etc. There is an opportunity to manage OPM’s IT systems more efficiently and effectively through the development and implementation of an OPM-wide IT strategy. Through this strategy, OPM can leverage IT capabilities in one program area to support other program areas, OPM, and the federal government.
Given the critical importance of information to human resource management, OPM should have a clear, unified IT strategy that will assure scarce resources dedicated to IT are being spent wisely and based on agency business priorities.
