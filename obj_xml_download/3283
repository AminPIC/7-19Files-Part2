Further, OPM’s Retirement Systems implemented a Phased Retirement for Federal Annuitant Case Expert System and Annuity Roll systems, and OPM’s Financial Services team completed an upgrade of the Federal Employees Retirement System Further Revised Annuity Employees, as required by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013.&amp;nbsp; OPM also completed the implementation of an update to the financial and Retirement Services systems that allows annuitants to pay their life insurance premiums when their annuity is too small to cover them.

Planning for the Infrastructure as a Service (also known as Shell) migration requires new funding and developer resources, and entails significant risk to functionality based upon unknowns about the security tools.&amp;nbsp; The timing of the migration may affect delivery of the next generation USAJOBS, requiring a delay until FY 2017 for the migration.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>A significant portion of OPM’s budget is spent on information technology (IT). For the most part, these expenditures are dedicated to the development and support of information technology systems for specific HR business functions. The remainder of the expenditures support OPM’s workforce, such tools as email, calendaring, remote access, Internet access, file storage, etc. There is an opportunity to manage OPM’s IT systems more efficiently and effectively through the development and implementation of an OPM-wide IT strategy. Through this strategy, OPM can leverage IT capabilities in one program area to support other program areas, OPM, and the federal government.
Given the critical importance of information to human resource management, OPM should have a clear, unified IT strategy that will assure scarce resources dedicated to IT are being spent wisely and based on agency business priorities.
