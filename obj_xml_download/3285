</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Office of the Chief Financial Officer</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>&amp;nbsp;OPM completed all planned actions under this strategy. In FY 2014, OPM implemented its new 5-year Strategic Plan, which set the foundation for OPM budgets through FY 2018.&amp;nbsp; The agency rolled out the Strategic Plan in January 2014, and shortly thereafter completed the FY 2015 Congressional Budget Justification, which aligned resource needs to the new strategic goals and strategies.&amp;nbsp; OPM then began to make long-term changes to the budget processes and embarked on an effort to incorporate prioritization of requirements as a part of the annual budget process. OPM established an agency council, representative of each program office, to develop the new process, which has been used for two performance budget submissions to identify requirements and validate funding justifications.&amp;nbsp; To promote transparency, the process also forces visibility into program costs, helps clarify and define the basis for OPM activities and why they are performed, and established a method to prioritize OPM activities using mission based criteria (drivers). OPM created a spreadsheet-based budget prioritization tool to support the process and collect required data and information. As a result, this new process aided in refining agency budget formulation activities.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>The uncertain budget environment imposes an imperative on all agency officials to better manage financial resources and to better position the agency to meet strategic priorities.  While agency budgets have been allocated to agency strategies, tracking of expenditures and allocation of resources have been aligned to program areas and object classes.  Aligning budget setting and expenditure tracking to agency strategies will ensure a continuous focus on achievement of the agency’s strategic goals.  Other tools, such as activity-based costing and common services allocation methodology, will provide clarity to senior managers as they collectively target resources toward achievement of the agency’s strategic goals. In the end, the process must enable the Director and senior officials to prioritize and adjust resources to align with current and future priorities.
