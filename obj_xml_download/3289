			In FY 2015, OPM began the work to mature the Manager and Executive LEAD Program from a “Certificate of Completion Program” to a “Certificate of Mastery Program,” and will begin monitoring and measuring the effectiveness of this initiative once it is completed and the program begins to be delivered in FY 2016.

			&amp;nbsp;

			OPM’s Human Resources Solutions’ professional leadership development courses and programs attracted 19,047 Government employees in FY 2015.&amp;nbsp; The Leadership for a Democratic Society Program was awarded the Outstanding Program Award at the 2015 Association of Leadership Educator’s International Conference in Washington, DC.&amp;nbsp; OPM developed and offered its second blended learning program for the Leadership for a Democratic Society program, combining technology-based and classroom-based learning.&amp;nbsp; The FY 2015 program was revised based on input from a FY 2014 pilot class, resulting in significant improvements to the online portion of the program, and improved participation and completion. In FY 2016 and beyond, this program will be widely available for the Federal workforce via this blended method of delivery.&amp;nbsp; Also in FY 2015, OPM’s Federal Executive Institute offered its first course to graduates of the Leadership for a Democratic Society program. That course, Leading Difficult Change: A Case Study of the Civil Rights Movement, attracted 45 participants, and more, similarly-designed courses will be offered in FY 2016.

			&amp;nbsp;

			OPM conducted extensive analysis that included cross walking curricula to engagement behaviors in an effort to identify gaps associated with employee engagement.&amp;nbsp; OPM is using this analysis to target and strengthen offerings in specific competencies that will improve employee engagement throughout the Federal Government.

			&amp;nbsp;

			To further international partnerships, in September 2015, OPM Federal Executive Institute staff participated in Korea’s Central Official’s Training Institute’s International conference on Human Resource Development in an Era of Globalization.&amp;nbsp; OPM also worked with the Dutch Embassy to support their senior government leaders’ leadership development seminar in Washington, DC by providing staff support, a talk by Harvard professor Lenny Marcus, and a table-top simulation focused on cybersecurity.

			&amp;nbsp;

			The Senior Executive Service (SES) Program welcomed more than 400 new career SES and SES-equivalents from more than 30 Federal agencies during the Government-wide SES Orientation Briefings hosted by the Federal Executive Institute and the White House Presidential Personnel Office.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>To foster a heightened connection between employees and their work and their organization, federal agencies and managers must ensure employees find personal meaning in their work, take pride in their work and their organization, and believe they are valued contributors. Engaged employees are passionate and dedicated to their job and organization.  They feel a special bond with their agency and put forth the extra effort needed to improve their own performance and agency results. Employee engagement has been linked to important outcomes, including agency performance, sick leave usage, EEO complaints, and turnover. Engaged employees are less likely to leave their agency, while those who are unengaged will likely start to look for better opportunities elsewhere.
Key drivers of employee engagement are communication, employee involvement, opportunities for development, and recognition. Strong leadership and supervision also are critical to ensuring an engaged workforce as they have a great deal of influence over the factors that drive engagement.
