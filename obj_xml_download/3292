</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>To foster a heightened connection between employees and their work and their organization, federal agencies and managers must ensure employees find personal meaning in their work, take pride in their work and their organization, and believe they are valued contributors. Engaged employees are passionate and dedicated to their job and organization.  They feel a special bond with their agency and put forth the extra effort needed to improve their own performance and agency results. Employee engagement has been linked to important outcomes, including agency performance, sick leave usage, EEO complaints, and turnover. Engaged employees are less likely to leave their agency, while those who are unengaged will likely start to look for better opportunities elsewhere.
Key drivers of employee engagement are communication, employee involvement, opportunities for development, and recognition. Strong leadership and supervision also are critical to ensuring an engaged workforce as they have a great deal of influence over the factors that drive engagement.
