</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Federal Investigative Services</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>In September 2014, OPM announced it would not exercise options to renew contracts with the contractor that performed the majority of its background investigations.&amp;nbsp; The agency has continued its operations by assigning cases to its Federal staff and its two remaining investigative contractors.&amp;nbsp; In addition, OPM signed an agreement with another contractor to take on a support services contract, which was effective October 1, 2014.&amp;nbsp; Because of the short-term reduction in investigative resources, the time to complete initial national security investigations increased throughout FY 2015.&amp;nbsp; To counter the temporary reduction in capacity, OPM’s Federal Investigative Services and its two fieldwork contractors increased their field staff, backfilled vacant Federal positions, and maximized OPM’s training capabilities Actions that OPM has taken to expand investigative capacity are within budget constraints, while maintaining the high-quality of OPM’s investigations.&amp;nbsp; Until the additional vetted and trained resources are in place, OPM expects that investigation timeliness will continue to degrade and inventory will continue to increase through FY 2016.&amp;nbsp; OPM will continue to re-evaluate its position to determine if additional measures are needed to meet timeliness goals while continuing to deliver high quality investigations.

&amp;nbsp;

OPM officials met with OMB and interagency partners to address how to respond to seven legislative proposals related to suitability and security clearance reform introduced in the 113th Congress.&amp;nbsp; Although this effort was an outgrowth of the Presidentially-directed 120-day review of suitability, fitness, credentialing, and national security investigative and adjudicative procedures for Federal employees, members of the Armed Forces, and employees of Government contractors, it was also important to OPM in other ways, for example by potentially changing the contours of its options with respect to contracting.

&amp;nbsp;

Also in FY 2015, in accordance with the Government-wide phased implementation plan, OPM implemented the Tiers 1 and 2 investigation products that improve the quality of vetting by providing more information to decision-makers for suitability and credentialing determinations.&amp;nbsp; The new products are based on the 2012 Federal Investigative Standards that OPM and the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) jointly issued in December 2012.&amp;nbsp; Further, OPM began implementing the new Executive Branch-wide Quality Assessment Standards for investigations signed by OPM and the DNI on January 22, 2015.

&amp;nbsp;

Meeting Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 and DNI timeliness goals while continuing to deliver high quality investigations will continue to be OPM’s Federal Investigative Services’ main challenge into FY 2016.&amp;nbsp; OPM is addressing this challenge by developing and employing detailed key measures of operational performance and tracking progress toward improving timeliness.&amp;nbsp; In addition, to increase its capacity to execute investigations, OPM has developed plans to hire additional Federal field agents.&amp;nbsp; Further, OPM is developing a new enterprise case management system which will allow detailed end-to-end management of investigations, allowing for more item-level scheduling which will result in efficient and cost effective operations.

&amp;nbsp;

OPM, in consultation with OMB, has highlighted this strategy as a focus area for improvement.
</Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update></Strategic_Objective><Strategic_Goals><Strategic_Goal><id>3297</id><strategic_goal_header>SG8 Enhanced Federal Workforce Integrity </strategic_goal_header><strategic_goal_statement>Enhance the integrity of the federal workforce.
</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>The integrity of the federal workforce is enhanced through the review of the suitability of individual applicants, ongoing reviews of federal employees, and the oversight of agency human resource systems that promote fairness and merit in all hiring and assessment processes. 
As the Suitability Executive Agent, the Director of OPM is responsible for ensuring that those whom agencies select and retain to serve the United States Government and the American people are fit to serve.  To do this, we must develop and implement consistent, uniform policies, tools, and processes for determinations of suitability, assignment to sensitive positions, and access to Federal facilities’ and information systems.  Executing these responsibilities encompasses the collection of background investigation information.  OPM’s activity in support of this goal helps protect our national security and provides the American people a reliable and responsible employee team they can trust in fulfilling important government functions. 
OPM is mandated by statute to ensure delegated human resource authorities are carried out in accordance with merit system principles and OPM standards. In addition, Executive Order 13197 (Government-wide Accountability for Merit System Principles; Workforce Information) authorizes OPM to hold Executive departments and agencies accountable to the President for effective human capital management.

While OPM has made significant progress on timeliness since 2004, the agency has maintained its primary focus on delivering top quality products to agencies. OPM will work with its executive branch reform partners to develop and implement Executive Branch quality standards, with a measurement tool designed for universal application during both the investigative and adjudicative processes. OPM will focus on implementing these additional initiatives while maintaining timeliness objectives.  OPM will satisfy all national security standards, deliver quality products, and achieve Congressional and DNI mandated timeliness goals.
OPM is sensitive to the fiscal environment and the need for customer agencies (i.e., the employing or sponsoring agencies) to have more insight into the costs of background investigations. To this end, OPM will continue conducting business efficiency studies and maturing its cost allocation model to provide more detailed cost data and to optimize the value of OPM’s investigative products to agency adjudicators, which in turn translates into better value to taxpayers.
