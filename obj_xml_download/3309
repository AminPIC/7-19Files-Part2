</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Healthcare and Insurance</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>OPM’s FEHB tobacco cessation benefits were featured at the National Prevention Council meeting presentation by US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy in March 2015.&amp;nbsp; OPM provided FEHB smoking cessation flyers, along with those of the Army’s Surgeon General. The materials were then shared with all occupational health clinics in the Army and other Army medical resources.&amp;nbsp; This information has proven valuable for agencies seeking tobacco free environments and support from their senior leadership and labor unions.

&amp;nbsp;

OPM also maintained visibility on the Department of Defense’s Addictive Substance Misuse Advisory Committee for Tobacco, and has remained an active partner in the Million Hearts Initiative and most recently, the DC Quits Initiative.
