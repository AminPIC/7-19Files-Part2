</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>EPA will implement programs that reduce and control ozone-depleting substances (ODS), enforce rules on their production, import, and emission, and facilitate the transition to alternative products that reduce GHG emissions and save energy.&amp;nbsp; EPA’s contributions to the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol will help to continue support for cost-effective projects designed to build capacity and eliminate ODS production and consumption in over 60 developing countries.&amp;nbsp; EPA will also continue partnership programs that educate the public about the importance of protection from harmful ultraviolet radiation.

&amp;nbsp;

External Factors and Emerging Issues

Protection of the ozone layer is a global problem that cannot be solved by domestic action alone—all nations must also phase out the use of ODS. &amp;nbsp;Much remains to be done in the U.S. and in the global community at large before the ozone layer will be considered safe for current and future generations. &amp;nbsp;Critical emerging issues include the need to ensure that:


	Ozone depleting substances are replaced by alternatives that reduce overall risk to human health and the environment;
	Use of the agricultural fumigant methyl bromide is phased out in a manner that provides continued control of pests that threaten food supplies and other economically important products traded internationally by the U.S.[14]; and,
	Remaining ODS phaseout, including the 2013 and 2015 developing-country ODS reduction requirements, is appropriately supported in a manner that is both cost effective and climate friendly.[1]

Endnotes:


	All countries that are Parties to the Montreal Protocol have agreed to phase out their production and consumption of ozone depleting substances (ODS). The Multilateral Fund was set up by agreement among the Parties, and the Fund’s purpose is to assist developing countries to comply with these obligations.&amp;nbsp; Contributions are made to the Multilateral Fund by developed countries, also referred to as donor countries under the Treaty.

</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Office of Air and Radiation</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>The EPA, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budge, has determined that performance toward this objective is making noteworthy progress. EPA continues to lead progress domestically and internationally in efforts to restore and protect the ozone layer. Domestically, the Agency is making progress as anticipated in the FY 2014–2018 EPA Strategic Plan, which states that by 2015, U.S. consumption of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs)—chemicals that deplete the earth’s protective ozone layer—will be less than 1,520 tons per year of ozone depletion potential (ODP) from the 2009 baseline of 9,900 tons per year. Final FY 2013 data indicate that the United States has reduced HCFC consumption to 1,640 tons. EPA expects that, as a result of worldwide reduction in ODSs, the level of “equivalent effective stratospheric chlorine” in the atmosphere will have peaked at 3.185 parts per billion (ppb) of air by volume by 2015, and begun its gradual decline to less than 1.800 ppb (the 1980 level).

</Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update></Strategic_Objective><Strategic_Goals><Strategic_Goal><id>3328</id><strategic_goal_header>Addressing Climate Change and Improving Air Quality</strategic_goal_header><strategic_goal_statement>Reduce greenhouse gas emissions and develop adaptation strategies to address climate change, and protect and improve air quality. 
</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Climate change poses risks to human health, the environment, cultural resources, the economy, and quality of life.[1]  These changes are expected to create further challenges to protecting human health and welfare.  Many effects of a changing climate are already evident and will persist into the future regardless of future levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  For example, average U.S. temperatures are rising, snow and rainfall patterns are shifting, and more extreme climate events—like heavy rainstorms and record high temperatures—are already affecting society, human health, and the environment.  Potential climate change impacts may also make it more difficult to achieve clean air goals.  To better protect human health and the environment, EPA must recognize and consider the challenge a changing climate poses to the environment. 
 
Notwithstanding this challenge, since passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments in 1990, nationwide air quality has improved significantly.[2]  Levels of those pollutants linked to the greatest health impacts continue to decline.  From 2003 to 2011, population-weighted ambient concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone have decreased 26 percent and 16 percent, respectively.  Even with this progress, in 2010 approximately 40 percent of the U.S. population lived in counties with air that did not meet health-based standards for at least one pollutant.  Long-term exposure to elevated levels of certain air pollutants has been associated with increased risk of cancer, premature mortality, and damage to the immune, neurological, reproductive, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems.[3]  Because people spend much of their lives indoors, the quality of indoor air is also a major health concern.  Indoor allergens and irritants play a significant role in making asthma worse and triggering asthma attacks.  The most recent data (2011) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tell us that 26 million Americans have asthma, and in 2010, CDC reports that asthma was the primary diagnosis for nearly 2 million hospital emergency visits.[4]  In 2008, more than half of children and one-third of adults who had an asthma attack missed school or work because of asthma and total costs for Americans from asthma was $56 billion in 2007.[5]   Exposure to indoor radon is responsible for an estimated 21,000 premature lung cancer deaths each year.[6]  Twenty percent of the population spends the day indoors in elementary and secondary schools, where potential problems with leaky roofs and with heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems can trigger a host of health problems, including asthma and allergies.
