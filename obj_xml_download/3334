</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>NASA’s workforce and institutional capabilities enable us to successfully conduct our missions. We are dedicated to innovation, bold ideas, and excellence, which enable us to provide the day-to-day operations required to support and achieve our missions.

People are our most important resource; without them, no mission can be achieved. We have a workforce that is skilled, competent, and dedicated. Our workforce is committed and passionate, and brings many dimensions of diversity, including ideas and approaches, to make our teams successful. To conduct our missions over the next 20 to 30 years, we must focus on attaining an increasingly diverse workforce with the right balance of skills and talents and provide an inclusive work environment in which employees with varying perspectives, education levels, skills, life experiences, and backgrounds work together and are fully engaged in NASA’s Mission.

</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Mission Support Directorate</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>NASA, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, has highlighted this strategic objective as a focus area for improvement.

Through the Strategic Review and the Agency’s other performance management processes, NASA reviews recent accomplishments and near term plans for the Agency’s strategic objectives and programs. Strategic Objective 3.1 covers NASA’s workforce and institutional capabilities. NASA has had several recent successes within this portfolio of activities, including success in diversity and equal opportunity, workforce satisfaction and engagement, communications, and sustainability and energy usage. For the fifth consecutive year, NASA was ranked as the top large agency for innovation and, for the third consecutive year, as the Best Place to Work in the Federal Government. Over the next several years, NASA’s critical steps under this strategic objective include investing in projects that reduce energy costs, demolishing un-needed infrastructure, renewing and consolidating facilities, continuing to use targeted outreach and recruitment efforts, focusing on activities that impact workforce innovation, and using current and emerging communications technologies, platforms and methods to reach increasingly broader and more diverse audiences. Specific performance measures for the next two years can be found in NASA’s FY 2016 and FY 2017 Annual Performance Plans.

The Strategic Review also addresses long-term strategic outcomes, alignment, and key management challenges for each strategic objective, as well as across NASA’s portfolio of activities. During last year’s Strategic Review, Strategic Objective 3.1 was rated as a Focus Area for Improvement, and is rated the same this year. Despite the successes noted above, challenges remain within Strategic Objective 3.1. Continued attention and resources are needed to address risks associated with deferred maintenance, aging infrastructure, and environmental compliance. In 10 years, a part of NASA’s vision for success for this strategic objective is for NASA’s institutional capabilities to enable us to provide the day-to-day operations required to support and achieve the Agency’s missions. However, about 83 percent of NASA’s infrastructure and facilities are currently beyond their constructed design life. Aging infrastructure from the Apollo era is costly to maintain and, in some cases, poses risk to mission operations. To address challenges associated with aging infrastructure, NASA is aggressively managing its facility portfolio to consolidate and modernize into fewer, more efficient and sustainable facilities. NASA has achieved some success in consolidating facilities, reducing energy costs, and demolishing unneeded infrastructure and will continue to use these strategies to manage its facilities portfolio. Additionally, NASA will continue to prioritize and triage maintenance and repair work to prevent or minimize facility failures and impacts to missions.

Additional details on the FY 2015 performance for supporting Performance Goals and Annual Performance Indicators are provided in NASA’s FY 2015 Annual Performance Report. Information on the strategies for achieving this strategic objective can be found in the 2014 NASA Strategic Plan.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>NASA is proud to be the U.S. agency charged with exploring the unknown in space and driving new advances in aerospace science and technology on behalf of the American public. Reaching for the stars requires dedicated, knowledgeable people and cutting-edge facilities and capabilities to provide the tools and support necessary to carry out our ambitious tasks. We strive to accomplish our mission with the utmost care-recognizing that we are stewards of taxpayer dollars, critical human capital, and one-of-a-kind facilities. We maintain a large and diverse set of technical capabilities and assets to support NASA missions and the work of other Federal agencies and the private sector to test validate, and optimize innovations.
We understand that a skilled, valued, and diverse workforce is central to creating and maintaining the capabilities to explore the solar system and beyond and for understanding our home planet. NASA will continue to maintain and ensure the availability and safety of critical capabilities and facilities necessary for advancing our space-, air-, and Earth-based activities. We will provide the vision and leadership to advance critical spaceflight capabilities and ensure American launch vehicles can support our exploration activities. Our activities support a skilled, innovative, and diverse workforce and the safety of that workforce. Further, we strive for management excellence and sustainable practices that assure the wisest uses of our resources.
Our goal is to support all of NASA’s space-, air-, and Earth-based research and innovation activities producing the best return on the Nation’s investment. We will diligently work to ensure that NASA has the resources necessary to further exploration and aeronautics, understand Earth, transfer knowledge, and share NASA’s story. We will continue to engage and involve the public and other stakeholders in our activities and work to build an open, transparent, and participatory organization.
As part of this pursuit, we must ensure that our facilities, resources, and plans are sustainable. This means exploring new ways of doing business. We will advance our efficiency and sustainability through wise investments and innovative approaches to resource management, including divesting ourselves of infrastructure no longer needed, so that we can achieve our core mission within our budget.
The missions we pursue under this goal helps to address national challenges and allow us to take advantage of unique opportunities to bring benefits to the Nation. For example:
• We are investing wisely
We are prioritizing investments and finding innovative ways to operate and sustain our capabilities.
• We are sustaining and exercising critical national capabilities
We are ensuring that cutting-edge capabilities and facilities are maintained and used for advancing innovation and discovery.
• We are increasing our accountability to the American public
We are providing unprecedented transparency into our operations and our performance so that we can share our successes and setbacks with the American public.
