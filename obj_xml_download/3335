</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>We identify and prioritize our essential assets and implement strategic investment decisions to sustain, enhance, replace, modify, or dispose of them based on NASA and National needs. We ensure that our key capabilities and critical assets will be available in the future to support the missions that require them. For example, we provide launch services to NASA and civil sector missions, as well as an uninterrupted, reliable space communications network to allow data transmissions to Earth from space. Both of these capabilities are critical to making space missions feasible, safe, and efficient.

NASA’s technical capabilities and assets support NASA missions as well as the work of others beyond NASA. Other Federal agencies and the private sector use our specialized facilities to test and evaluate items to mitigate risk and optimize engineering designs. We manage our technical capabilities and assets carefully through strategic investments and sustainable practices that ensure their readiness for NASA and other customers.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Human Exploration Operations Mission Directorate</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>NASA, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, has highlighted this strategic objective as a focus area for improvement.

Through the Strategic Review and Agency’s other performance management processes, NASA reviews recent accomplishments and near term plans for Agency’s strategic objectives and programs. Under Strategic Objective 3.2, multiple NASA programs provide critical services and strategic technical programmatic capabilities for the Agency. Recent examples of progress include the successful launches of missions such as the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission and the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission via the Launch Services Program (LSP), and the Rocket Propulsion Test (RPT) program has completed 368 successful tests with 98.4% test stand availability. Over the next several years, NASA’s critical next steps are to complete the second new 34-meter deep-space antenna at Canberra by the end of FY 2016, continue development of the Space Network Ground Segment Sustainment (SGSS) project, provide valuable propulsion data to the SLS and Orion programs as they prepare for Exploration Missions 1 and 2, and continue to successfully launch the assigned NASA and civil sector robotic missions plus acquire new launch services for future NASA missions. &amp;nbsp;Specific performance measures for the next two years can be found in NASA’s FY 2016 and FY 2017 Annual Performance Plans.


The Strategic Review also addresses long-term strategic outcomes, alignment, and key management challenges for each strategic objective, as well as across NASA’s portfolio of activities. The NASA 2015 Strategic Review noted that areas for improvement for this strategic objective include challenges within the Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) portfolio. These issues constitute significant budget and programmatic challenges to the Agency’s critical network and communication activities.

For more information, highlighted achievements during FY 2015 are detailed in the FY 2015 Agency Financial Report. Additional details on the FY 2015 performance for supporting Performance Goals and Annual Performance Indicators are provided in NASA’s FY 2015 Annual Performance Report. Information on the strategies for achieving this strategic objective can be found in the 2014 NASA Strategic Plan.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>NASA is proud to be the U.S. agency charged with exploring the unknown in space and driving new advances in aerospace science and technology on behalf of the American public. Reaching for the stars requires dedicated, knowledgeable people and cutting-edge facilities and capabilities to provide the tools and support necessary to carry out our ambitious tasks. We strive to accomplish our mission with the utmost care-recognizing that we are stewards of taxpayer dollars, critical human capital, and one-of-a-kind facilities. We maintain a large and diverse set of technical capabilities and assets to support NASA missions and the work of other Federal agencies and the private sector to test validate, and optimize innovations.
We understand that a skilled, valued, and diverse workforce is central to creating and maintaining the capabilities to explore the solar system and beyond and for understanding our home planet. NASA will continue to maintain and ensure the availability and safety of critical capabilities and facilities necessary for advancing our space-, air-, and Earth-based activities. We will provide the vision and leadership to advance critical spaceflight capabilities and ensure American launch vehicles can support our exploration activities. Our activities support a skilled, innovative, and diverse workforce and the safety of that workforce. Further, we strive for management excellence and sustainable practices that assure the wisest uses of our resources.
Our goal is to support all of NASA’s space-, air-, and Earth-based research and innovation activities producing the best return on the Nation’s investment. We will diligently work to ensure that NASA has the resources necessary to further exploration and aeronautics, understand Earth, transfer knowledge, and share NASA’s story. We will continue to engage and involve the public and other stakeholders in our activities and work to build an open, transparent, and participatory organization.
As part of this pursuit, we must ensure that our facilities, resources, and plans are sustainable. This means exploring new ways of doing business. We will advance our efficiency and sustainability through wise investments and innovative approaches to resource management, including divesting ourselves of infrastructure no longer needed, so that we can achieve our core mission within our budget.
The missions we pursue under this goal helps to address national challenges and allow us to take advantage of unique opportunities to bring benefits to the Nation. For example:
• We are investing wisely
We are prioritizing investments and finding innovative ways to operate and sustain our capabilities.
• We are sustaining and exercising critical national capabilities
We are ensuring that cutting-edge capabilities and facilities are maintained and used for advancing innovation and discovery.
• We are increasing our accountability to the American public
We are providing unprecedented transparency into our operations and our performance so that we can share our successes and setbacks with the American public.
