</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>Safety and mission success programs protect the health and safety of the NASA workforce and improve the likelihood that NASA’s programs, projects, and operations will be completed safely and successfully. NASA’s commitment to safety and mission success extends to the American public, our employees, our commercial partners, and our contractors. We do this through an environment of trust and ethical behavior using diverse multidisciplinary teams that foster equal opportunity, collaboration, and continuous learning. We promote technical excellence and competence while ensuring safety, reliability, maintainability, quality engineering, and project management within NASA.

</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Office of Safety and Mission Assurance, Office of Chief Engineer, and Office of the Chief Health and Medical Officer</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>Through the Strategic Review and the Agency’s other performance management processes, NASA reviews recent accomplishments and near term plans for the Agency’s strategic objectives and programs. Program elements managed by the Office of the Chief Engineer, Office of Safety and Mission Assurance, and the Office of the Chief Health and Medical Officer fall under Strategic Objective 3.4. These program elements together are more broadly referred to as “Safety and Mission Success.” These programs work to protect the health and safety of the NASA workforce and improve the likelihood that NASA’s programs, projects, and operations are completed safely and successfully. During the 2015 Strategic Review, NASA found no major changes from the 2014 Strategic Review assessment, and performance measures for Safety and Mission Success are all on track. In the near term future SMS will continue to ensure effective management of NASA programs and operations to complete the mission safely and successfully. Specific performance measures for the next two years can be found in the FY 2016 and FY 2017 Annual Performance Plans.

The Strategic Review also addresses long-term strategic outcomes, alignment, and key management challenges for each strategic objective, as well as across NASA’s portfolio of activities. A challenge for this strategic objective include the fact that NASA’s mission requires working in many unforgiving environments, including the upper atmosphere, low Earth orbit, and deep space. Safety and Mission Success offices work to ensure mission safety and success given these environmental challenges, but Safety and Mission Success faces resource constraints. Some areas of concern regarding SMS disciplines include aviation safety, human factors, non-destructive evaluation, nuclear flight safety, pressure systems, and technical risk and statistical analysis.

For more information, highlighted achievements during FY 2015 are detailed in the FY 2015 Agency Financial Report. Additional details on the FY 2015 performance for supporting Performance Goals and Annual Performance Indicators are provided in NASA’s FY 2015 Annual Performance Report. Information on the strategies for achieving this strategic objective can be found in the 2014 NASA Strategic Plan.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>NASA is proud to be the U.S. agency charged with exploring the unknown in space and driving new advances in aerospace science and technology on behalf of the American public. Reaching for the stars requires dedicated, knowledgeable people and cutting-edge facilities and capabilities to provide the tools and support necessary to carry out our ambitious tasks. We strive to accomplish our mission with the utmost care-recognizing that we are stewards of taxpayer dollars, critical human capital, and one-of-a-kind facilities. We maintain a large and diverse set of technical capabilities and assets to support NASA missions and the work of other Federal agencies and the private sector to test validate, and optimize innovations.
We understand that a skilled, valued, and diverse workforce is central to creating and maintaining the capabilities to explore the solar system and beyond and for understanding our home planet. NASA will continue to maintain and ensure the availability and safety of critical capabilities and facilities necessary for advancing our space-, air-, and Earth-based activities. We will provide the vision and leadership to advance critical spaceflight capabilities and ensure American launch vehicles can support our exploration activities. Our activities support a skilled, innovative, and diverse workforce and the safety of that workforce. Further, we strive for management excellence and sustainable practices that assure the wisest uses of our resources.
Our goal is to support all of NASA’s space-, air-, and Earth-based research and innovation activities producing the best return on the Nation’s investment. We will diligently work to ensure that NASA has the resources necessary to further exploration and aeronautics, understand Earth, transfer knowledge, and share NASA’s story. We will continue to engage and involve the public and other stakeholders in our activities and work to build an open, transparent, and participatory organization.
As part of this pursuit, we must ensure that our facilities, resources, and plans are sustainable. This means exploring new ways of doing business. We will advance our efficiency and sustainability through wise investments and innovative approaches to resource management, including divesting ourselves of infrastructure no longer needed, so that we can achieve our core mission within our budget.
The missions we pursue under this goal helps to address national challenges and allow us to take advantage of unique opportunities to bring benefits to the Nation. For example:
• We are investing wisely
We are prioritizing investments and finding innovative ways to operate and sustain our capabilities.
• We are sustaining and exercising critical national capabilities
We are ensuring that cutting-edge capabilities and facilities are maintained and used for advancing innovation and discovery.
• We are increasing our accountability to the American public
We are providing unprecedented transparency into our operations and our performance so that we can share our successes and setbacks with the American public.
