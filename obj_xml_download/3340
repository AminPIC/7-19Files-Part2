</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>Earth’s changing environment impacts every aspect of life on our planet and climate change has profound implications on society. Studying Earth as a single complex system is essential to understanding the causes and consequences of climate change and other global environmental concerns. NASA addresses the issues and opportunities of climate change and environmental sensitivity by answering the following questions through our Earth Science programs: How is the global Earth system changing? What causes these changes in the Earth system? How will Earth’s systems change in the future? How can Earth system science provide societal benefits?

NASA’s Earth science programs shape an interdisciplinary view of Earth, exploring the interaction among the atmosphere, oceans, ice sheets, land surface interior, and life itself, which enables scientists to measure global and climate changes and to inform decisions by Government, organizations, and people in the United States and around the world. We make the data collected and results generated by our missions accessible to other agencies and organizations to improve the products and services they provide, including air quality indices, disaster prediction and response, agricultural yield projections, and aviation safety.

</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Science Mission Directorate</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>NASA, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, has determined that performance toward this strategic objective is making noteworthy progress.

Through the Strategic Review and the Agency’s other performance management processes, NASA reviews recent accomplishments and near term plans for the Agency’s strategic objectives and programs. NASA’s Strategic Objective 2.2 is pursued by the Science Mission Directorate (SMD) Earth Science Division, which seeks to develop a scientific understanding of Earth’s system and its response to natural or human-induced changes, and to improve prediction of climate, weather, and natural hazards. NASA’s 2015 Strategic Review found that the Earth Science flight program is making great progress towards Strategic Objective 2.2. For example, NASA recently achieved a significant accomplishment by launching five Earth observing missions in one calendar year, including two that use the ISS as a platform. In addition, significant scientific contributions were noted by the 2014 external expert review. Our critical next steps include continuing the development of several missions, such as the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) III (which will utilize the International Space Station as a platform), Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite 2 (ICESat-2), Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) Follow-on, and the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS). Specific performance measures for the next two years can be found in NASA’s FY 2016 and FY 2017 Annual Performance Plans.

The Strategic Review also addresses long-term strategic outcomes, alignment, and key management challenges for each strategic objective, as well as across the NASA’s portfolio of activities. In 10 years, NASA plans that the Agency’s current efforts under Strategic Objective 2.2 will lead to further understanding of the Earth as a system to meet the challenges of environmental change as well as continued improvement of life on Earth. Many of the key challenges for the Earth Science Division are common across all of the SMD divisions—access to space; technology development; project technical, cost, and schedule challenges; partnerships; and mission support services and infrastructure—and are articulated in the 2014 Science Plan. NASA is also facing the challenge of continuing to advance Earth system science (including research endeavors, observational capabilities, and data systems) while simultaneously addressing increasing demands to provide sustained climate observations—all within a constrained budget. The Earth Science Division is pursuing several opportunities to mitigate or address challenges, such as international partnerships, developing new and innovative ways of making Earth observations via the Earth Venture solicitations, utilizing the International Space Station as a platform for observations, and continuing to make technology investments through the Earth Science Technology Program.

Additional details on the FY 2015 performance for supporting Performance Goals and Annual Performance Indicators are provided in NASA’s FY 2015 Annual Performance Report. Information on the strategies for achieving this strategic objective can be found in the 2014 NASA Strategic Plan. Additional information on strategies, challenges, implementation, and program-specific detail is available in the NASA 2014 Science Plan.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>NASA is committed to improving life right here on Earth. Whether developing new aircraft technologies for safer, more efficient air travel, uncovering the complexities of Earth's natural systems, or transferring technologies to the commercial marketplace, NASA has a record of accomplishment in advancing understanding of Earth and helping to improve life for its inhabitants. Every discovery NASA makes, all knowledge gained through our space endeavors, and every advance in technology benefits us on Earth.

We take pride in our ability to inspire people of all ages in the United States and around the world through our pursuits. From landing robots on Mars to teaching in classrooms around the country, we are excited to provide opportunities for people everywhere to engage and participate with us as we push the boundaries of human knowledge and exploration.

NASA will continue to advance research in aeronautics to enable both sustainable and efficient air transportation. Understanding our home planet and improving life on it is central to our mission and is a critical national priority As we make new discoveries about Earth and environmental change, we are protecting our economic vitality and learning how to be better stewards of our home planet.

The effects of climate change are all around us-more severe storms and hurricanes, droughts, and other natural disasters have both a human toll and an economic toll. NASA is working to understand the mechanisms and possible actions Federal, state, and local agencies and organizations and communities can take to minimize the impacts of environmental change.

NASA improves life on Earth by enhancing our economy through aeronautics research to enable more efficient air transportation. NASA has a long and successful history of pioneering technology breakthroughs that underlie most modern aviation systems. The millions of people and trillions of dollars in cargo that fly every year on commercial aircraft are benefiting from years of NASA research and collaboration with other agencies to get to their destinations faster and with greater safety.

NASA contributes to economic vitality and innovation through the transfer of technologies that generate new revenue for private companies or help foster creation of entirely new ventures. We lend expertise, facilities, and innovations to other Federal agencies and entrepreneurs. From emerging commercial launch providers to robotic mining ventures, NASA is working with U.S. companies to find the right way to encourage these nascent industries-whether through helping to advance key technologies, purchasing launch services for crews to low Earth orbit, lending expertise, or providing launch opportunities to small businesses conducting research.

The missions we pursue under this goal address national priorities and directly benefit both our Nation and the global community. For example:

• We are tracking and characterizing the mechanisms of environmental change.

Our assets in space and on Earth are giving us unprecedented insight into the Earth system and how we can minimize the impacts of environmental change.

• We are building the next generation air transport system.

Together with our partners in other agencies, we are bringing to life a future vision that will enable transformative change to the entire air transportation system.

• We are strengthening the economy.

We are transferring knowledge and technologies, which strengthens the economy though innovation, increased revenue, and job creation.

• We are cultivating a strong future workforce.

We are cultivating scientific literacy and a strong future workforce through STEM education.
