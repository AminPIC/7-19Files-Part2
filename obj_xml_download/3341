</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>NASA’s missions require that we expand the boundaries of our technological capabilities to explore our solar system, increase our understanding of space, and improve life on Earth. Innovation and invention are the necessary elements that will enable this progress and shape our future. Efficient management of technology investments is more critical than ever. NASA, like other technology development organizations, both Government and commercial, must balance technology investments and promote successful innovation with limited resources.

To optimize the technology portfolio, we seek to align mission directorate technology investments, eliminate duplication, and lower costs while providing critical capabilities that support missions and longer-term national needs. We strive to develop tools and processes to manage the technology portfolio, find better ways to analyze our portfolio, identify mission needs, create roadmaps, set priorities, establish partnerships, and engage scientists, engineers, and the public to invent extraordinary technologies for our future.

</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Office of the Chief Technologist</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>Through the Strategic Review and the Agency’s other performance management processes, NASA reviews recent accomplishments and near term plans for the Agency’s strategic objectives and programs. Under Strategic Objective 2.3, NASA’s Office of the Chief Technologist (OCT) provides the strategy and leadership that guide NASA’s technology development and open innovation activities. OCT accomplished a number of Federal government “firsts” this year, including the public release of TechPort and the release of an updated version of NASA’s software catalog. Additionally, OCT launched NASASolve and the Asteroid Data Hunter Challenge greatly exceeded expectations.

Over the next several years, NASA’s critical next steps are to complete an independent review of the 2015 NASA Technology Roadmaps, finalize the updated NASA Strategic Technology Investment Plan (STIP), and develop and implement a new initiative to track infusion of NASA-developed technology into NASA missions and ground activities. Specific performance measures for the next two years can be found in NASA’s FY 2016 and FY 2017 Annual Performance Plans.

The Strategic Review also addresses long-term strategic outcomes, alignment, and key management challenges for each strategic objective, as well as across NASA’s portfolio of activities. In 10 years, NASA plans that the Agency’s current efforts under Strategic Objective 2.3 will lead to the optimization of the Agency’s technology portfolio (by aligning technology investments across organizations and minimizing duplication). Open Innovation will thrive within NASA, and the transfer of technologies to U.S. companies will be maximized. NASA is working to improve the transfer of technology to external users, which requires the resources and workforce to implement.

For more information, please see http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/home/index.html. Highlighted achievements during FY 2015 are detailed in the FY 2015 Agency Financial Report. Additional details on the FY 2015 performance for supporting Performance Goals and Annual Performance Indicators are provided in NASA’s FY 2015 Annual Performance Report. Information on the strategies for achieving this strategic objective can be found in the 2014 NASA Strategic Plan.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>NASA is committed to improving life right here on Earth. Whether developing new aircraft technologies for safer, more efficient air travel, uncovering the complexities of Earth's natural systems, or transferring technologies to the commercial marketplace, NASA has a record of accomplishment in advancing understanding of Earth and helping to improve life for its inhabitants. Every discovery NASA makes, all knowledge gained through our space endeavors, and every advance in technology benefits us on Earth.

We take pride in our ability to inspire people of all ages in the United States and around the world through our pursuits. From landing robots on Mars to teaching in classrooms around the country, we are excited to provide opportunities for people everywhere to engage and participate with us as we push the boundaries of human knowledge and exploration.

NASA will continue to advance research in aeronautics to enable both sustainable and efficient air transportation. Understanding our home planet and improving life on it is central to our mission and is a critical national priority As we make new discoveries about Earth and environmental change, we are protecting our economic vitality and learning how to be better stewards of our home planet.

The effects of climate change are all around us-more severe storms and hurricanes, droughts, and other natural disasters have both a human toll and an economic toll. NASA is working to understand the mechanisms and possible actions Federal, state, and local agencies and organizations and communities can take to minimize the impacts of environmental change.

NASA improves life on Earth by enhancing our economy through aeronautics research to enable more efficient air transportation. NASA has a long and successful history of pioneering technology breakthroughs that underlie most modern aviation systems. The millions of people and trillions of dollars in cargo that fly every year on commercial aircraft are benefiting from years of NASA research and collaboration with other agencies to get to their destinations faster and with greater safety.

NASA contributes to economic vitality and innovation through the transfer of technologies that generate new revenue for private companies or help foster creation of entirely new ventures. We lend expertise, facilities, and innovations to other Federal agencies and entrepreneurs. From emerging commercial launch providers to robotic mining ventures, NASA is working with U.S. companies to find the right way to encourage these nascent industries-whether through helping to advance key technologies, purchasing launch services for crews to low Earth orbit, lending expertise, or providing launch opportunities to small businesses conducting research.

The missions we pursue under this goal address national priorities and directly benefit both our Nation and the global community. For example:

• We are tracking and characterizing the mechanisms of environmental change.

Our assets in space and on Earth are giving us unprecedented insight into the Earth system and how we can minimize the impacts of environmental change.

• We are building the next generation air transport system.

Together with our partners in other agencies, we are bringing to life a future vision that will enable transformative change to the entire air transportation system.

• We are strengthening the economy.

We are transferring knowledge and technologies, which strengthens the economy though innovation, increased revenue, and job creation.

• We are cultivating a strong future workforce.

We are cultivating scientific literacy and a strong future workforce through STEM education.
