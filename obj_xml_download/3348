</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>Planetary science continues to expand our knowledge of the solar system, with active missions and Earth-based research programs exploring all the way from Mercury to Pluto and beyond. We seek to answer fundamental questions: How did our solar system form and evolve? Is there life beyond Earth? What are the hazards to life on Earth?

Robotic exploration is the principal method we use to explore the solar system, and is an essential precursor to human exploration of space. Ground based observations, experiments, theoretical work, and analysis of extraterrestrial materials supplement our space-based assets. Each progression from flybys, to orbiting spacecraft, to landers and rovers, to sample return missions helps advance our understanding of the formation of planetary bodies, the chemical and physical history of the solar system, and the conditions that are capable of sustaining life. The successful Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity, for example, is allowing us to explore the potential habitats for past life on Mars.

Our investment in planetary science helps us protect Earth by identifying and characterizing celestial bodies and environments that may pose threats to our planet. Further, planetary science programs add to the pool of knowledge necessary for future human exploration missions. In support of the Asteroid Grand Challenge, we will enhance our Near Earth Objects Observation program to improve the detection and characterization of potential asteroid candidates for robotic and crewed exploration.

</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Science Mission Directorate</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>NASA, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, has determined that performance toward this strategic objective is making noteworthy progress.

Through the Strategic Review and the Agency’s other performance management processes, NASA reviews recent accomplishments and near term plans for the Agency’s strategic objectives and programs. NASA’s Strategic Objective 1.5 is pursued by the Science Mission Directorate (SMD) Planetary Science Division, which continues to expand the Agency’s knowledge of the solar system. For example, in FY 2015, the New Horizons mission accomplished the historic first-ever flyby of Pluto, and the Dawn spacecraft arrived at Ceres, the largest object in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The Planetary Science Division launched their last three missions below each mission’s development cost estimates, and particularly noteworthy scientific discoveries were announced in the last year. Our critical next steps include continuing the development of the next Planetary Science missions, including the&amp;nbsp;Mars 2020&amp;nbsp;mission&amp;nbsp;and the Origins,&amp;nbsp;Spectral Interpretation,&amp;nbsp;Resource Identification, and&amp;nbsp;Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) asteroid mission. Specific performance measures for the next two years can be found in NASA’s FY 2016 and FY 2017 Annual Performance Plans.

The Strategic Review also addresses long-term strategic outcomes, alignment, and key management challenges for each strategic objective, as well as across NASA’s portfolio of activities. In 10 years, NASA plans that the Agency’s current efforts under Strategic Objective 1.5 will lead to further understanding of the content, origin, and evolution of the solar system as well as the potential for life elsewhere. A recurrent threat in this area is the requirements creep that missions may face, which, if left unchecked, likely would lead to cost growth and schedule slip.&amp;nbsp; Many of the key challenges for the Planetary Science Division are common across all of the SMD divisions (access to space; technology development; project technical, cost, and schedule challenges; partnerships; and mission support services and infrastructure) and are articulated in the 2014 Science Plan. With the current and anticipated budget, it is difficult to maintain a balanced program between competed and strategic missions, across planetary destinations, and among research and technology investments. However, Planetary Science is sustaining extensive intra- and extra-Agency partnerships, and is pursuing efficiencies and informed investments tied to long-term strategic needs.

Additional details on the FY 2015 performance for supporting Performance Goals and Annual Performance Indicators are provided in NASA’s FY 2015 Annual Performance Report. Information on the strategies for achieving this strategic objective can be found in the 2014 NASA Strategic Plan. Additional information on strategies, challenges, implementation, and program-specific detail is available in the NASA 2014 Science Plan.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Expanding the frontiers of knowledge, capability, and opportunity in space is an enduring and core goal for NASA. In the past decade alone, we increased our knowledge of the universe as evidenced by the discovery of more than 2,000 planets in other solar systems. Closer to home, we have expanded our exploration capabilities and sent out robotic sentinels to explore our solar system. The Curiosity rover landed more than 225 million kilometers from Earth and is actively exploring Mars. It has already accomplished its major science goal, discovering a location that could have supported microbial life in the past. We are planning to deepen our knowledge of the working of the interior of planetary bodies by placing a highly sensitive seismometer and associated geophysical instruments on the surface of Mars with the InSight mission. In 2020, we will continue our robotic exploration of Mars with a rover largely built upon the successful Curiosity rover and equipped with new, advanced instruments for in situ studies. It will prepare a scientifically selected cache of Mars samples that may be returned to Earth in the future for detailed analysis seeking possible signs of ancient life.
We are undertaking the detailed examination of near-Earth asteroids to determine what they can tell us about the early solar system, and whether any of these objects pose a threat to Earth. We are expanding our Near Earth Object Observation program, to find candidates for the proposed asteroid mission, and to catalogue asteroids larger than 140 meters across. Specifically, NASA will seek to increase the number of asteroid observations by the amateur astronomer community as a part of the Asteroid Grand Challenge. In 2016, we will launch the OSIRIS-REx mission to robotically approach and return a sample from a carbonaceous asteroid. This will aid in our investigation of planet formation and the origin of life in our solar system, as well as our understanding of asteroids that could impact Earth.
The missions we pursue under this goal help address national challenges and are allowing us to take advantage of unique opportunities to bring benefits to the Nation. For example:

• We are moving forward with critical research and technology demonstrations on the ISS.

Great advances in understanding human health have come from research on the ISS, which
can help prepare us for long-duration space travel, as well as improve the quality of life for aging populations on Earth.

• We are contributing to healthy, cutting-edge manufacturing and aerospace sectors.

For SLS, we are using 3D manufacturing technology to print custom parts for the system, marking a revolution in manufacturing.

• We are enabling a robust commercial space industry.

We are leveraging our public-private partnerships to lower launch costs and create more opportunities for commercial space flight.

• We are adding to the scientific understanding that may be needed to protect Earth.

Our proposed asteroid initiative, comprised of both a bold new mission to an asteroid and a global grand challenge to find all asteroid threats to human populations, will help identify the threats posed by some asteroids as well as teach us how to possibly avoid future impacts.

• We are moving outward, beyond low Earth orbit, into the broader solar system.

We are developing SLS and the Orion to carry astronauts farther into space than humans have ever been.
