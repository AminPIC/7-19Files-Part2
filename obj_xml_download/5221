</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century (MAP-21) Act requires States to develop and implement asset management plans and performance plans specifically for highways and bridge infrastructure. MAP-21 also establishes a new National Transit Asset Management System, requiring a strategic approach to asset management by grantees.&amp;nbsp; We will encourage our partners to adopt and use asset management practices through training and technical assistance, research and demonstration projects, and by adopting common performance measures and reporting systems.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office></Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>The 2013 DOT Condition and Performance Report for highway and transit&amp;nbsp;reported that the Nation continues to struggle with keeping its transportation infrastructure in good condition. A lack of good information about inventories and conditions&amp;nbsp;compound the challenge of maintaining conditions with limited resources.&amp;nbsp;

In FY 2015, the Federal Highways Administration (FHWA) and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) made progress in developing tools and techiniques for State and local transportation agencies to keep better track of their inventory and measure its condition.&amp;nbsp;

Details for FHWA's asset management initiatives can be found at&amp;nbsp;http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/asset/pubs/hif13042.pdf.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Recent reports on the condition of key facilities—highways, bridges, transit systems, passenger rail and airports—reveal that many fall short of a state of good repair and thus compromise the safety, capacity, and efficiency of the U.S. transportation system. We bring a strong programmatic emphasis and new resources to improving and sustaining the condition of our infrastructure. We will encourage our government and industry partners to make optimal use of existing capacity, minimize life-cycle costs, and apply sound asset management principles throughout the system.
