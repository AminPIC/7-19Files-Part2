</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>In the National Security Strategy, the President renewed the Nation’s commitment to being the global engine of scientific discovery and innovation. DOE helps prepare the Nation for a range of potential national security challenges by strengthening science, technology and engineering capabilities, and providing a modernized, responsive infrastructure. The Nuclear Posture Review notes that our specialized workforce is essential to managing the deterrent and supporting the full range of the President’s nuclear security agenda. DOE provides the experimental and computational capability and infrastructure required to execute the Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program and other DOE national security missions. By working at the leading edge of multiple scientific and technical disciplines, the DOE nuclear security programs integrate scientific principles, address theory, field physical experiments, and conduct complex modeling and simulation to support not only the assessment and certification of the Nation’s nuclear weapons, but also nonproliferation, counter-proliferation, nuclear counterterrorism, and intelligence activities. DOE will bolster the capabilities of the U.S. government to address cyber and other related security threats through research and development, vulnerability analyses, testing at physical and virtual ranges, and modeling and simulation.

NNSA will modernize the Department’s infrastructure to safely and securely manage special nuclear materials, with priority on executing plans to ensure continuity of plutonium capability at Los Alamos National Laboratory and highly enriched uranium processing capability at the Y-12 Plant. NNSA will also ensure the safety and security of its facilities, which will include modernizing its infrastructure and added emphasis on site security across the nuclear security complex.

NNSA stewards the NNSA national laboratories and sites as an enterprise to deliver DOE programs, provide critical capabilities to support other national security missions, and drive innovation. Talented researchers, engineers, and technicians work across a range of national-level challenges and enhance their skills and expertise by working concurrently on stockpile stewardship and other national priority missions. For example, supercomputers are key to stockpile stewardship, but also have been used to provide foreign threat assessments and to open up the field of nanotechnology. NNSA relies on key capabilities at other DOE national laboratories to deliver its nuclear security missions, and works closely with DOE’s Office of Nuclear Energy.

By sponsoring research programs at universities and student internships at DOE labs to secure a pipeline of national security professionals, DOE plays a critical role in ensuring the intellectual vitality of the national security technical enterprise. DOE also pursues strategic interagency partnerships with the Departments of State, Defense, and Homeland Security, and the U.S. Intelligence Community to ensure that our technical capabilities are accessible and applied to meet the needs of the broader national security community.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>National Nuclear Security Administration</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>Last year, agencies were required to review progress made toward strategic objectives using the agency Strategic Plan, and release summary results on Performance.gov in February 2015. The agency’s strategic review considers performance goals and other evidence, as well as challenges, risks, and external factors that may have affected the outcomes. OMB works with agencies to determine which strategic objectives require focused improvement or noteworthy progress relative to other strategic objectives. Because the Department of Energy released their strategic plan late in 2014, the Department did not complete a strategic review in 2014, but is expected to conduct the review in the future.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>The DOE national security mission supports nuclear security, intelligence and counterintelligence operations, and related national security needs. The President’s 2010 National Security Strategy, the Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), and the ratification of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty underscored the importance of the DOE’s nuclear mission, and renewed the mandate for DOE to maintain a safe, secure, and reliable stockpile for as long as nuclear weapons exist. The NPR presented a path to reduce global nuclear security threats while permitting access to peaceful nuclear power for nations that respect the international nonproliferation regime. DOE will advance the President’s vision to move toward a world free of nuclear weapons by both dismantling retired weapons and improving global stability through increased transparency and confidence building measures.
DOE, through the National Nuclear Security Administration’s (NNSA) nuclear security enterprise, plays a central role in sustaining a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent and combating proliferation and nuclear terrorism. The science, technology, engineering and manufacturing capabilities resident in the nuclear security enterprise underpin our ability to conduct stockpile stewardship and solve the technical challenges of verifying treaty compliance, combating nuclear terrorism and proliferation, and guarding against the threat posed by nuclear technological surprise. For example, the unique knowledge gained in nuclear weapons design developed to support the U.S. stockpile plays a critical role in the nation’s ability to understand strategic threats worldwide. DOE is responsible for providing the design, development and operational support required to provide militarily effective naval nuclear propulsion plants and ensure their safe, reliable and long-lived operations.
By providing a modernized, responsive infrastructure, DOE prepares the nation for a range of potential future nuclear deterrence challenges. With its extensive science and technology capabilities and nuclear expertise, DOE provides support to defense, homeland security, and intelligence missions, primarily through DOE’s system of national laboratories and sites. DOE also provides expert knowledge and operational capabilities for physical security, classification, emergency preparedness and response, nuclear forensics and cybersecurity.
