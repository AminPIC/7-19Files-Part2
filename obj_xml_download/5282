</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>DOE provides the design, development, and operational support required to provide militarily effective nuclear propulsion plants and ensure their safe, reliable, and long-lived operation. DOE is responsible for the reactor plant design and development for the Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine replacement, which will include new technology to allow lower-cost construction while enhancing plant safety and survivability and reducing life-cycle costs. It also will refuel its land-based reactor plant prototype in support of essential research and development efforts, and work toward the recapitalization of the program’s 50-year old used nuclear fuel infrastructure to ensure the flexibility needed to adjust to future mission demands.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>National Nuclear Security Administration</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>Last year, agencies were required to review progress made toward strategic objectives using the agency Strategic Plan, and release summary results on Performance.gov in February 2015. The agency’s strategic review considers performance goals and other evidence, as well as challenges, risks, and external factors that may have affected the outcomes. OMB works with agencies to determine which strategic objectives require focused improvement or noteworthy progress relative to other strategic objectives. Because the Department of Energy released their strategic plan late in 2014, the Department did not complete a strategic review in 2014, but is expected to conduct the review in the future.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>The DOE national security mission supports nuclear security, intelligence and counterintelligence operations, and related national security needs. The President’s 2010 National Security Strategy, the Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), and the ratification of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty underscored the importance of the DOE’s nuclear mission, and renewed the mandate for DOE to maintain a safe, secure, and reliable stockpile for as long as nuclear weapons exist. The NPR presented a path to reduce global nuclear security threats while permitting access to peaceful nuclear power for nations that respect the international nonproliferation regime. DOE will advance the President’s vision to move toward a world free of nuclear weapons by both dismantling retired weapons and improving global stability through increased transparency and confidence building measures.
DOE, through the National Nuclear Security Administration’s (NNSA) nuclear security enterprise, plays a central role in sustaining a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent and combating proliferation and nuclear terrorism. The science, technology, engineering and manufacturing capabilities resident in the nuclear security enterprise underpin our ability to conduct stockpile stewardship and solve the technical challenges of verifying treaty compliance, combating nuclear terrorism and proliferation, and guarding against the threat posed by nuclear technological surprise. For example, the unique knowledge gained in nuclear weapons design developed to support the U.S. stockpile plays a critical role in the nation’s ability to understand strategic threats worldwide. DOE is responsible for providing the design, development and operational support required to provide militarily effective naval nuclear propulsion plants and ensure their safe, reliable and long-lived operations.
By providing a modernized, responsive infrastructure, DOE prepares the nation for a range of potential future nuclear deterrence challenges. With its extensive science and technology capabilities and nuclear expertise, DOE provides support to defense, homeland security, and intelligence missions, primarily through DOE’s system of national laboratories and sites. DOE also provides expert knowledge and operational capabilities for physical security, classification, emergency preparedness and response, nuclear forensics and cybersecurity.
