</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>The recent trend towards more international movement of people and goods and globalization of markets is expected to continue.&amp;nbsp; This means that there will be continued growth in international air traffic and more goods and services transported from within the country to ports and then across national borders. We will focus on creating new opportunities in foreign markets for U.S. transportation-related goods and services.&amp;nbsp; We will continue our efforts to create a more competitive air transportation system and protect the rights of traveling consumers. We will advance U.S. economic interests in targeted markets abroad in order to create additional transportation-related jobs. We set standards for both the manufacture and operation of transportation products. American transport manufacturers and service providers rely on access to foreign markets through liberalized entry or operational rules and compatible technical standards. We exert extensive positive influence over international transportation development as well as to heighten U.S. competitiveness. Through the development of a National Freight Strategic Plan pursuant to MAP-21, we will also focus transportation infrastructure investments on projects that will particularly benefit U.S. exports.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Our goal is to support the U.S. economy by fostering strategic investments that will serve the traveling public and facilitate freight movement now and in the future. Transportation enables economic activity, quality of life, connected communities, and ladders of opportunity to education, opportunities, and services. In order to support the lives and economies of neighborhoods, regions, and the Nation, we must invest wisely in transportation. Our central strategies for achieving maximum economic returns on our policies and investments include leading the development of intercity, high-speed passenger rail and a competitive air transportation system; increasing travel time reliability in freight-significant highway corridors; improving the performance of freight rail and maritime networks; advancing transportation interests in targeted markets around the world; expanding opportunities in the transportation sector for small businesses; and creating a dynamic workforce.
