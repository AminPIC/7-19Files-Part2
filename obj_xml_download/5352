</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>Investment in world-class physical assets will continue, from brick and mortar facilities to cutting edge technology systems, to enable the United States to remain a world leader in scientific and technological advances. Sites and laboratories will address current and future use of land and facilities including sustainable operations and post-closure responsibilities. DOE efforts to operate more efficiently, perform cleanup, and address post-closure responsibilities are resulting in sites and laboratories with a smaller footprints and more efficient and effective infrastructure. Mission objectives, energy efficiency, and sustainability principles will drive decisions on capital infrastructure, real property, and information technology. This includes planning, divestiture, acquisition, and sharing of assets with other governments, communities, academia, and industry; supporting conveyance and reuse of unneeded land and facilities; and performing long-term surveillance and maintenance of legacy sites.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Legacy Management;Management; Sustainability Performance</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>Last year, agencies were required to review progress made toward strategic objectives using the agency Strategic Plan, and release summary results on Performance.gov in February 2015. The agency’s strategic review considers performance goals and other evidence, as well as challenges, risks, and external factors that may have affected the outcomes. OMB works with agencies to determine which strategic objectives require focused improvement or noteworthy progress relative to other strategic objectives. Because the Department of Energy released their strategic plan late in 2014, the Department did not complete a strategic review in 2014, but is expected to conduct the review in the future.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Attaining mission success requires a sustained commitment to performance-based management and expectations of excellence from DOE headquarters to every site office, service center, laboratory, and production facility. At the center of this goal is a highly qualified, capable, and flexible federal workforce that can execute the mission in a safe, secure, efficient, and sustainable manner. DOE cultivates a performance-based system that links work to meeting agency and Administration goals and achieves results. Management of research and development involves prioritization of those activities with the greatest potential and likelihood for impact. Research decisions are informed by rigorous peer reviews at the portfolio level and solicitation levels. Also, improving contract and project management across the DOE enterprise is a top priority, along with vigilant protection of our cyber networks. Additional project cost and schedule analysis training will be provided, and upgrades will be sought for the information technology infrastructure.
