</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>The employees of DOE are its strongest asset. When employees’ health and safety are protected and they are well trained, empowered, and free from discrimination, they will ensure mission success efficiently and effectively. DOE is entrusted with a unique mission to protect the nation’s federal nuclear industrial operations, and thus holds a special responsibility to maintain oversight of the safety and security of those hazardous operations. Rigorous self-analysis is employed, including performance evaluations and testing conducted independent of site or headquarters line management. Because public trust is vital to success, DOE emphasizes openness, transparency, and collaboration with workers and their representatives, and the communities in which DOE operates. The DOE enterprise—including government-owned, contractor-operated sites—is also being strengthened to address a range of cyber threats that can adversely impact mission capabilities.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Environment, Health, Safety, and Security; Chief Information Officer</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>Last year, agencies were required to review progress made toward strategic objectives using the agency Strategic Plan, and release summary results on Performance.gov in February 2015. The agency’s strategic review considers performance goals and other evidence, as well as challenges, risks, and external factors that may have affected the outcomes. OMB works with agencies to determine which strategic objectives require focused improvement or noteworthy progress relative to other strategic objectives. Because the Department of Energy released their strategic plan late in 2014, the Department did not complete a strategic review in 2014, but is expected to conduct the review in the future.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Attaining mission success requires a sustained commitment to performance-based management and expectations of excellence from DOE headquarters to every site office, service center, laboratory, and production facility. At the center of this goal is a highly qualified, capable, and flexible federal workforce that can execute the mission in a safe, secure, efficient, and sustainable manner. DOE cultivates a performance-based system that links work to meeting agency and Administration goals and achieves results. Management of research and development involves prioritization of those activities with the greatest potential and likelihood for impact. Research decisions are informed by rigorous peer reviews at the portfolio level and solicitation levels. Also, improving contract and project management across the DOE enterprise is a top priority, along with vigilant protection of our cyber networks. Additional project cost and schedule analysis training will be provided, and upgrades will be sought for the information technology infrastructure.
