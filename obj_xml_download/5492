</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>In an era of decreasing budgets and resources, partners across the Department must strive to find and develop innovative solutions for training, exercising, and evaluating capabilities. Achieving baseline proficiency and maintaining high levels of readiness in homeland security-related individual and collective skills and knowledge are critical to a unified partnership of law enforcement, first responders, and other front-line operators.

We will pursue the following strategies to train and exercise frontline operators and first responders:


	Support systems for training, exercising, and evaluating capabilities by pursuing integrated and cohesive cross-component training and evaluation.
	Support law enforcement, first responder, and risk management training by providing coordinated, interoperable, and standardized law enforcement training to DHS and non-DHS federal agents/officers as well as to state, local, tribal and territorial and international entities.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>The Nation’s experiences in the years since September 11, 2001 highlight the importance of joining efforts across all levels of society and government into a common homeland security. In considering the evolution of the Department and the ever-changing environment in which it operates, we have identified several key, cross-cutting functional areas of focus for action within the Department that must be accomplished in order for it to successfully execute its core missions. These functions, and the critical activities associated with them, serve as the supporting foundation that underpins all homeland security missions.
These goals also support the Unity of Effort Initiative, which builds important linkages between the Department’s planning, programming, budgeting, and execution processes, ensuring that the Department invests and operates in a cohesive, unified fashion, and makes decisions that are transparent and collaborative to drive the Secretary’s strategic guidance to results.
