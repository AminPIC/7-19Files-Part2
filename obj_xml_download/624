[1] States with approved ESEA Flexibility requests were initially required to implement teacher and principal evaluation and support systems by 2014–15 or 2015–16, depending on the school year of initial approval. Through ESEA Flexibility renewal in fall 2014, the Department committed to working with states that need to make adjustments to implementation timelines or sequencing through the ESEA Flexibility renewal process.


</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview></Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Office of Elementary and Secondary Education</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>Over the past several years, states and school districts have made educator effectiveness a key priority in their reform efforts. States and districts are working on the development and implementation of high-quality teacher and principal evaluation and support systems, as well as broader human capital management systems that use the results of evaluation systems to inform targeted educator development and support opportunities, placement, retention, promotion, compensation, and other personnel decisions. The Department has supported the work of states and districts in this area through key programs and initiatives such as Title I, Title&amp;nbsp;II, RTT, Teacher Incentive Fund, ESEA Flexibility, Excellent Educators for All, and the Comprehensive Center on Great Teachers and Leaders (in addition to the other regional and content comprehensive centers), and using these programs and initiatives to provide resources and technical assistance to states and districts so that they can move forward with successful implementation. In 2015, more states and districts are implementing teacher and principal evaluation and support systems that are based on multiple measures, including evidence of student learning growth as a significant factor.

Similar to objective 2.1, the results of this metric are greatly influenced by state and district actions, as well as other factors not in the Department’s control. As teacher and school leader evaluation and support systems are governed by state and local policies, without revisions in state policies and new partnerships with teacher and principal organizations, reforms of existing evaluation and support systems are unlikely to be successful.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>The goal for America’s educational system is clear: every student should graduate from high school ready for college and a career.  Every student should have meaningful opportunities from which to choose upon graduation from high school.  Over the past few years, states, districts, and schools have initiated groundbreaking reforms and innovations to try to meet this goal.  For the first time, almost every state is supporting higher standards that will demonstrate that students are truly college- and career-ready. States are also coming together to develop the next generation of assessments that are not only aligned with these new standards but also advance essential skills that promote critical thinking, problem solving, and the application of knowledge.  At the same time, states, districts, and schools are working to meet the challenges of putting a highly-qualified teacher in every classroom and a strong and effective leader in every school; building local capacity to support successful school turnarounds; redesigning high school education by building stronger connections among secondary education, postsecondary education, and the workplace; and improving teacher preparation and classroom instruction in STEM education.
 
But, while many schools are increasing the quality of instruction and improving academic achievement, there is also broad agreement that the U.S. education system fails to consistently provide all students with the excellent education necessary to achieve college- and career-readiness.  The result is that too many U.S. students are failing to reach their full potential. Recent National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) scores show that low-income students are “roughly two years of learning behind the average better-off student of the same age.” Also, according to the 2009 McKinsey report The Economic Impact of the Achievement Gap in America’s Schools, on average, “black and Latino students are roughly two to three years of learning behind white students of the same age.”
 
Many children, particularly low-income children, students with disabilities, English learners, and children of color confront not only an achievement gap but also an opportunity gap. Today, a student in a school with high minority enrollment is much less likely to go to a school that offers calculus and physics than a student in a high school with low minority enrollment. Less than 8 percent of students taking Advanced Placement (AP) mathematics or AP science courses today are African American. Closing the opportunity gap will require that school resources, talent, and spending be targeted to the kids who need help the most.
 
The Department’s elementary and secondary education reforms focus on the building blocks needed for schools, school districts, and states to more consistently deliver excellent classroom instruction for all students. The foundation of these reforms is a system for improving learning and teaching that aligns with internationally benchmarked college- and career-ready standards, high-quality formative and summative assessments, and engaging and effective instructional content.  Ensuring that U.S. students have the critical thinking skills and other tools they need to be effective in the 21st-century economy means improving teaching and learning in all content areas—from literacy, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to history, civics and government, geography, foreign languages, the arts, economics and financial literacy, environmental education, computer science, health education, and other subjects.
 
Highly important to student success is the creation of a sustainable collaborative relationship between labor and management. Increasing student achievement and improving student outcomes while effectively implementing college- and career-ready standards can be a direct result of effective labor-management collaboration. Since 2009, the Department has worked closely with national labor-management partners to support states and districts in building their capacity for collaboration in an effort to improve teaching, learning, and instructional content.  Strong labor-management collaboration can be a bridge to success rather than a barrier.
 
A strong reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA)that reinforces and extends the progress already being made to strengthen the quality of elementary and secondary education would further this goal.
How will we measure success?  
 
The Department will use the following indicators to measure its success in helping states and school districts deliver excellent instruction that is aligned with rigorous standards while ensuring effective support services that help students graduate college- and career-ready.
 
Elementary and Secondary Education Indicators of Success
 
Increase number of states that have adopted college- and career-ready standards
Increase number of states that are implementing next-generation assessments, aligned with college- and career-ready standards
Increase number of states that have fully implemented teacher and principal evaluation and support systems that consider multiple measures of effectiveness, with student growth as a significant factor
Decrease use of out-of-school suspensions, expulsions, and alternative school placements and reduce disparities in the rates these sanctions are applied to students with disabilities and youths of color
Decrease number of high schools with low graduation rates
Increase percentage of priority schools that have met the state exit criteria and exited priority school status
Increase percentage of focus schools that have met the state exit criteria and exited focus school status
Increase number of postsecondary STEM credentials awarded
Increase percentage of teachers who teach STEM as their main assignment and who hold a corresponding undergraduate degree
Increase number of public high school graduates who have taken at least one STEM Advanced Placement exam
What could hold us back?  What’s beyond our control?  (External Risk Factors)
 
States are moving forward in implementing important reforms to increase student achievement, close achievement gaps, and improve the quality of instruction.  Yet, efforts to implement college- and career-ready standards and new, aligned assessments, to acquire higher-quality instructional materials, and to develop and implement teacher and school leader evaluation systems have run up against resource limitations.  Developing and administering the next generation of assessments and supporting teachers and leaders through training related to the new standards will require continuing financial support, in addition to expert technical assistance, in order to help states tackle these new and complex reforms in a manner tailored to their unique needs. Similarly, states face challenges in turning around a large number of our lowest-performing schools, and in sustaining growth and improvement as grant funding declines. Finally, the pace of reforms may be dictated in part by future Congressional appropriations and the extent to which the reauthorization of ESEA requires rigorous interventions in each state’s lowest-achieving schools.
 
In the current economic climate, student needs often are growing while school budgets are contracting. Expanding services and supports to address students’ mental, emotional, and behavioral health, and to create positive school environments where all students can learn and excel will be a challenge. Cross-agency collaboration helps to connect agency programs and leverage community assets, but additional resources are needed to bring to scale effective school-based practices that support students struggling with trauma and poverty, improve student behavior, and increase campus safety.
 
To achieve the STEM goals, there needs to be improved coordination among federal agencies. In addition, high-quality, STEM-specific technical assistance is needed to address the limited capacity of some states and school districts to lead STEM-related programs. Finally, more states and districts must adopt rigorous STEM standards that will prepare students to succeed in these fields at the postsecondary level.

The goal is based on the premise, supported by abundant research, that teachers are the single most critical in-school factor in improving student achievement.  Principals are often cited as the second most influential in-school factor.  Teacher and principal evaluation and support systems supported by the Department of Education's (ED) contributing programs enable the development and identification of effective educators and provide needed information to improve the educator workforce.  Teachers and principals often lack meaningful evaluation, feedback, and support for professional growth. Indeed, teachers are often dissatisfied with their preparation programs and their opportunities for professional development and advancement. Too often, effective teachers and leaders are not recognized, rewarded, or asked to share their expertise with colleagues. Most teacher compensation systems do not recognize effectiveness or provide incentives to teach in challenging schools or shortage areas. And race and family income too often predict a child’s access to excellent educators. In light of the importance of teachers and school leadership for student success, the nation has to do more to ensure that every student has an effective teacher, every school has an effective leader, and every teacher and leader has access to the preparation, on-going support, recognition, and collaboration opportunities he or she needs to succeed. ED will help strengthen the profession by focusing on meaningful feedback, support, and incentives at every stage of a career, based on fair evaluation and support systems that look at multiple measures, including, in significant part, growth in student learning. ED will support state and district efforts that provide time for teacher collaboration, personalized on-the-job learning opportunities, and professional advancement. Targets are based on state implementation timelines provided through original Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) flexibility requests.  These timelines indicated that 37 states expected to implement the systems by September 30, 2015.  “Fully implemented” is defined as the school year in which teachers and principals receive effectiveness ratings.  However, as states and districts are moving forward, they are also encountering challenges with implementation of these systems, and are making adjustments to timelines, sequencing, and implementation steps that may not follow their original plans but will ultimately result in high-quality teacher and principal evaluation and support systems.
 
KEY BARRIERS AND CHALLENGES
ED will support states in the development and adoption of state requirements for comprehensive teacher and principal evaluation and support systems and in district development and implementation of comprehensive educator evaluation and support systems. Providing additional support to teachers and principals, as well as educator evaluators regarding these new evaluation and support systems is necessary so they are able, for example, to use and develop learning objectives to measure growth in student learning and to implement new classroom observation tools.  However, providing this level of support is also resource-intense at both the state educational agency (SEA) and local educational agency (LEA) level.  Additional challenges center on maintaining momentum for reform, given districts’ and states’ current political situations, potential changes in leadership, ongoing development of valid and reliable measures of growth in student learning in non-tested grades and subjects, and the scaling up of systems in a relatively short time frame.
 
EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS
Engagement of external stakeholders is regular and ongoing.  Program staff have regular contact with SEA staff through monitoring, technical assistance, and other outreach.  Policy and program staff regularly hold calls and travel to the Hill to brief member and committee staff.  ED has also engaged with and provided briefings for key external educational organizations, including the Council of Chief State School Officers, the National Governors Association, National Education Association, and American Federation of Teachers.  Ongoing outreach further involves a wide range of professional and content organizations, national community-based organizations, and foundations.
