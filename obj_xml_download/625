</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview></Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Office of Elementary and Secondary Education </Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>Strengthening school and classroom climate in preschool through 12th-grade settings is an essential precondition to scalable improvements in the academic achievement, socioemotional wellbeing, and college and career readiness of American public school students. While states, districts, and schools across the country have made real strides reforming approaches to school discipline and climate in order to ensure effective environments for more students, significant challenges remain to guaranteeing safe and supportive schools in which to learn and grow for all students. More than one in five students report being bullied in school; national data continue to suggest that suspensions and expulsions disproportionately impact minority students and SWDs; and too few schools are employing school climate data and interventions as part of their continuous improvement strategies. Maximizing instructional time to prepare all students for the rigors and opportunities of meaningful postsecondary educations and careers requires that these issues are addressed at every level of the P–12 system.

During FY 2015, the Department has pursued a vigorous strategy to improve school climate and community and encourage the nationwide adoption of evidence-based practices to ensure safe and supportive learning environments for all students. In June 2015, the Department hosted a two-day convening for 19 high-needs school districts to support their local implementation of “early warning systems” to identify and support students at-risk of falling behind in school and/or dropping out. This convening served to highlight effective local practices to use data strategically to identify students in need of additional support. To shine a light on effective reforms in school discipline policy and practice, and in support of the administration’s My Brother’s Keeper initiative, the Department sponsored—in collaboration with the White House and DOJ—a major summit on school climate and discipline, entitled “Rethink Discipline,” on July&amp;nbsp;22, 2015. This summit brought to the White House over 45 school districts and a coalition of public and private partners to elevate effective reforms of school discipline in schools, with the goal of highlighting best practices in eliminating disproportionalities and bias in the administration of school discipline. At the summit, the Department also released a new resource for school district superintendents and their leadership teams—“Rethink Discipline: A Resource Guide for Superintendent Action”—that provides suggested action steps and links to free resources to support communitywide efforts to reform and improve the efficacy of local school discipline and climate policy and practice. The Department also supported the development of new school climate survey resources that states, districts, and schools can use, free of charge, to systematically collect and act on school climate data from multiple stakeholders, including students, teachers, noninstructional school staff, and parents and families (to be released in FY&amp;nbsp;2016). The Department also laid significant groundwork for the launch of “Every Student, Every Day: A National Initiative to Address and Eliminate Chronic Absenteeism,” which aims to raise nationwide awareness of and encourage action to combat the serious problem of chronic absenteeism affecting between five and seven and a half million students each year. In collaboration with HHS, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), DOJ, and a coalition of public and private partners, the Department released on October 7, 2015, a Dear Colleague letter and community toolkit for states, districts, and schools that includes actionable strategies to address and eliminate chronic absenteeism within communities.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>The goal for America’s educational system is clear: every student should graduate from high school ready for college and a career.  Every student should have meaningful opportunities from which to choose upon graduation from high school.  Over the past few years, states, districts, and schools have initiated groundbreaking reforms and innovations to try to meet this goal.  For the first time, almost every state is supporting higher standards that will demonstrate that students are truly college- and career-ready. States are also coming together to develop the next generation of assessments that are not only aligned with these new standards but also advance essential skills that promote critical thinking, problem solving, and the application of knowledge.  At the same time, states, districts, and schools are working to meet the challenges of putting a highly-qualified teacher in every classroom and a strong and effective leader in every school; building local capacity to support successful school turnarounds; redesigning high school education by building stronger connections among secondary education, postsecondary education, and the workplace; and improving teacher preparation and classroom instruction in STEM education.
 
But, while many schools are increasing the quality of instruction and improving academic achievement, there is also broad agreement that the U.S. education system fails to consistently provide all students with the excellent education necessary to achieve college- and career-readiness.  The result is that too many U.S. students are failing to reach their full potential. Recent National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) scores show that low-income students are “roughly two years of learning behind the average better-off student of the same age.” Also, according to the 2009 McKinsey report The Economic Impact of the Achievement Gap in America’s Schools, on average, “black and Latino students are roughly two to three years of learning behind white students of the same age.”
 
Many children, particularly low-income children, students with disabilities, English learners, and children of color confront not only an achievement gap but also an opportunity gap. Today, a student in a school with high minority enrollment is much less likely to go to a school that offers calculus and physics than a student in a high school with low minority enrollment. Less than 8 percent of students taking Advanced Placement (AP) mathematics or AP science courses today are African American. Closing the opportunity gap will require that school resources, talent, and spending be targeted to the kids who need help the most.
 
The Department’s elementary and secondary education reforms focus on the building blocks needed for schools, school districts, and states to more consistently deliver excellent classroom instruction for all students. The foundation of these reforms is a system for improving learning and teaching that aligns with internationally benchmarked college- and career-ready standards, high-quality formative and summative assessments, and engaging and effective instructional content.  Ensuring that U.S. students have the critical thinking skills and other tools they need to be effective in the 21st-century economy means improving teaching and learning in all content areas—from literacy, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to history, civics and government, geography, foreign languages, the arts, economics and financial literacy, environmental education, computer science, health education, and other subjects.
 
Highly important to student success is the creation of a sustainable collaborative relationship between labor and management. Increasing student achievement and improving student outcomes while effectively implementing college- and career-ready standards can be a direct result of effective labor-management collaboration. Since 2009, the Department has worked closely with national labor-management partners to support states and districts in building their capacity for collaboration in an effort to improve teaching, learning, and instructional content.  Strong labor-management collaboration can be a bridge to success rather than a barrier.
 
A strong reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA)that reinforces and extends the progress already being made to strengthen the quality of elementary and secondary education would further this goal.
How will we measure success?  
 
The Department will use the following indicators to measure its success in helping states and school districts deliver excellent instruction that is aligned with rigorous standards while ensuring effective support services that help students graduate college- and career-ready.
 
Elementary and Secondary Education Indicators of Success
 
Increase number of states that have adopted college- and career-ready standards
Increase number of states that are implementing next-generation assessments, aligned with college- and career-ready standards
Increase number of states that have fully implemented teacher and principal evaluation and support systems that consider multiple measures of effectiveness, with student growth as a significant factor
Decrease use of out-of-school suspensions, expulsions, and alternative school placements and reduce disparities in the rates these sanctions are applied to students with disabilities and youths of color
Decrease number of high schools with low graduation rates
Increase percentage of priority schools that have met the state exit criteria and exited priority school status
Increase percentage of focus schools that have met the state exit criteria and exited focus school status
Increase number of postsecondary STEM credentials awarded
Increase percentage of teachers who teach STEM as their main assignment and who hold a corresponding undergraduate degree
Increase number of public high school graduates who have taken at least one STEM Advanced Placement exam
What could hold us back?  What’s beyond our control?  (External Risk Factors)
 
States are moving forward in implementing important reforms to increase student achievement, close achievement gaps, and improve the quality of instruction.  Yet, efforts to implement college- and career-ready standards and new, aligned assessments, to acquire higher-quality instructional materials, and to develop and implement teacher and school leader evaluation systems have run up against resource limitations.  Developing and administering the next generation of assessments and supporting teachers and leaders through training related to the new standards will require continuing financial support, in addition to expert technical assistance, in order to help states tackle these new and complex reforms in a manner tailored to their unique needs. Similarly, states face challenges in turning around a large number of our lowest-performing schools, and in sustaining growth and improvement as grant funding declines. Finally, the pace of reforms may be dictated in part by future Congressional appropriations and the extent to which the reauthorization of ESEA requires rigorous interventions in each state’s lowest-achieving schools.
 
In the current economic climate, student needs often are growing while school budgets are contracting. Expanding services and supports to address students’ mental, emotional, and behavioral health, and to create positive school environments where all students can learn and excel will be a challenge. Cross-agency collaboration helps to connect agency programs and leverage community assets, but additional resources are needed to bring to scale effective school-based practices that support students struggling with trauma and poverty, improve student behavior, and increase campus safety.
 
To achieve the STEM goals, there needs to be improved coordination among federal agencies. In addition, high-quality, STEM-specific technical assistance is needed to address the limited capacity of some states and school districts to lead STEM-related programs. Finally, more states and districts must adopt rigorous STEM standards that will prepare students to succeed in these fields at the postsecondary level.
