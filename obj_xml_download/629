</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview></Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Office of Elementary and Secondary Education</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>Securing a well-trained and properly supported early learning workforce is an essential element of high-quality early learning programs. Significant headway has been made in describing and conceptualizing what teachers do in the classroom that results in learning, which is a critical first step in getting teachers into those positions.

On April 1, 2015, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and National Research Council (NRC) released Transforming the Workforce for Children Birth through Age 8: A Unifying Foundation, which was commissioned by both the Departments of Education and HHS and four philanthropic foundations. The study explores the science of child development, particularly looking at implications for the professionals who work with children birth through age 8. The committee found that much is known about how children learn and develop, as well as the qualifications of the early childhood workforce and the supports they need. However, this knowledge is not fully reflected in the current capacities and practices of the workforce, the settings in which they work, and the qualifications and professional learning that is most effective.

The IOM/NRC Study outlines a blueprint for action based on 13 recommendations for local, state, and national governmental agencies, nongovernmental organizations, philanthropic funders, and the business sector to support improvements to the quality of professional practice for early learning professionals who work with children from birth through age 8 and the environments in which they work. The study makes recommendations on improving the quality of the early learning workforce, including higher levels of education such as a bachelor’s degree for lead educators, qualifications based more strongly on competencies and knowledge, and the use of evidence-based practices and strategies. Additionally, the study recommends fair compensation to recognize the professionalization of the workforce, as well as other improved supports for educators in their work environments. In the months following the release, additional communication materials were developed and distributed to the field through conferences, webinars, meetings, and in-service trainings.

ELC states are creating quality professional development systems to improve the skills of current and aspiring early learning teachers, directors, and assistant teachers. Fourteen ELC states are specifically working to provide and expand access to professional development opportunities that are aligned with their Workforce Knowledge and Competency Framework and that tightly link training with professional development approaches, such as coaching and mentoring (CO, DE, GA, KY, MD, MN, NJ, NM, OH, OR, PA, RI, WA, and WI). These states are also using incentives, such as scholarships, compensation and wage supplements, tiered reimbursement rates, other financial incentives and strategies to promote professional improvement and career advancement. These other strategies include management opportunities, and they promote professional improvement and career advancement along an articulated career pathway that is based on the state’s Workforce Knowledge and Competency Framework. Fifteen ELC states are working to support educators in improving their knowledge, skills and abilities (CA, CO, DE, GA, IL, MD, MA, MI, MN, NM, NC, OR, PA, RI, VT).

The Preschool Development Grants program sets a high bar for workforce quality in the 18&amp;nbsp;grantee states. High-quality preschool programs require, for example, high staff qualifications, including a teacher with a bachelor’s degree in early childhood education or a bachelor’s degree in any field with a state-approved alternate pathway, which may include coursework, clinical practice, and evidence of knowledge of content and pedagogy relating to early childhood, and teaching assistants with appropriate credentials. In addition, instructional staff salaries are required to be comparable to the salaries of local K-12 instructional staff, and programs must provide high-quality professional development for all staff.

Four states (Delaware, Iowa, Kansas, and Oregon) are finishing up working with the OSEP-funded Early Childhood Personnel Center (ECPC). This work centered on enhancing the personnel system within the states to ensure that personnel have the knowledge and skills to provide services to young children with disabilities and their families. These states developed and are implementing a plan to align their personnel standards with national professional organization personnel standards; develop partnerships with universities and community colleges to ensure that their curriculum is aligned to state personnel standards and to support better alignment between pre-service preparation and in-service professional development; and implement evidence-based practices within in-service professional development. ECPC is in the process of selecting four more states to work with over the next two years. In addition to providing intensive TA with states, ECPC held Leadership Institutes for 20 states. These Leadership Institutes provides strategies for Part C and Part B, section 619 coordinators and leaders within early childhood agencies to work together to develop the workforce so that they have the competencies to serve young children with disabilities and their families. Additionally, ECPC has facilitated national professional organizations coming together to identify a set of competencies that personnel need to serve young children with disabilities. Those organizations include including DEC, the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, the American Occupational Therapy Association, and the American Physical Therapy Association. Through this work, DEC and NAEYC are in the process of developing an agreement to align their personnel standards. During the fiscal year OSEP, also funded 7 new awards to universities to prepare personnel to work in early intervention and early childhood special education.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>The foundation of a thriving middle class is a strong education. But millions of children in this country can’t reach the first rung on the ladder of opportunity because they are cut off from access to high-quality early learning experiences. The first years of a child’s life are the most critical for brain development,[1] and strong and consistent evidence from research and evaluation demonstrate that participation in high-quality early learning programs can lead to both short- and long-term positive outcomes for children from both low-income and middle-class families.[2], [3]   Research finds that high-quality preschool programs can serve as effective early intervention programs for children with special needs[4] and provide significant benefits to English Learners.[5]  Study after study shows the benefits of high-quality early learning, including increased school readiness, lower rates of retention and special education placements, improved high school graduation, and higher rates of college attendance and completion.[6]
 
Children from low-income families, on average, start kindergarten 12 to 14 months behind their peers in pre-reading and language skills.[7] Results from the “Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010–11,” indicate scores on reading and math were lowest for kindergartners in households with incomes below the federal poverty level and highest for those in households with incomes at or above 200 percent of the federal poverty level.[8]  Additionally, children with a primary home language of English scored higher in reading and math than those coming from homes with a primary home language other than English.  High-quality early learning provides the foundation for children's success in school and helps to mitigate educational gaps that exist for children with high-needs before they enter kindergarten. By increasing access to high-quality early learning programs and services, the country can work to close, or even prevent, the achievement gap.
 
The Obama administration is committed to closing that unjust gap through one of the boldest proposed expansions of early learning opportunities in a generation.  The signature program in this effort is Preschool for All, a groundbreaking new federal-state partnership that would provide voluntary, high-quality preschool to all 4-year-olds from low- and moderate-income families.  The program would also create incentives for states to expand publicly funded preschool to middle-class families above 200 percent of the federal poverty level, and promote access to high-quality full-day kindergarten and early learning programs for children under the age of 4. The administration is also proposing Preschool Development Grants to support state efforts to establish the infrastructure for high-quality preschool. This will enable more states with preschool systems at various stages of development to provide universal access to high-quality preschool for 4-year-old children from low- and moderate-income families. President Obama’s Preschool for All proposal is a key part of the administration’s overall strategy to provide all children with the high-quality foundation that will prepare them for success in school and in life. As part of this strategy, the administration is also proposing Early Head Start-Child Care Partnerships in the Department of Health and Humans Services (HHS) to improve the quality of early learning programs for infants and toddlers, and expanding HHS’s voluntary evidence-based home visiting services. In addition, the administration has proposed an increase in funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Part C program to continue to support high-quality services for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families.
 
These quality early learning efforts build on significant work from the administration’s first term and ongoing federal investments in programs serving young children, including over $5 billion invested in early childhood programs through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), as well as Race to the Top – Early Learning Challenge (RTT-ELC), a program jointly administered by ED and HHS. The program has rewarded states that have agreed to raise the bar on the quality of their early learning programs, establish higher standards, and provide critical links with health, nutrition, mental health, and family support.  RTT-ELC states serve as model early learning and development systems, and are part of a national technical assistance strategy to reach all states. Only by coordinating the patchwork of early learning programs and services, and better integrating them with the elementary and secondary education system, can an integrated early learning system be built that improves health, social-emotional, and cognitive outcomes for children from birth through third grade. A high-quality, coordinated early learning system includes program standards, comprehensive assessment systems, workforce and professional development systems, family and community engagement, health promotion, and data systems.
 
In supporting the alignment of these systems, the administration will focus its efforts on improving outcomes for children with high needs by ensuring that they have access to high-quality early learning programs with demonstrated success in closing achievement gaps and reducing grade retention rates in later years. To enhance the quality of these programs and services, and improve outcomes for children from birth through third grade, including children with disabilities and those who are English learners, the Department will promote initiatives that increase access to high-quality, effective programs, improve the quality of the early childhood workforce, and support comprehensive assessment systems.
How will we measure success?  
The Department will use the following indicators to measure its success in improving the health, social-emotional, and cognitive outcomes for all children from birth through third grade, particularly those with high needs, to ensure they are on track for graduating from high school college- and career-ready.
 
Early Learning Indicators of Success
Increase the number of states with Quality Rating and Improvement Systems (QRIS) that meet high quality benchmarks for child care and other early childhood programs
Increase the number of states and territories with professional development systems that include core knowledge and competencies, career pathways, professional development capacity assessments, accessible professional development opportunities, and financial supports for child care provider
Increase the number of states collecting and reporting disaggregated data on the status of children at kindergarten entry using a common measure
What could hold us back?  What’s beyond our control?  (External Risk Factors)
The president’s proposal would provide the biggest increase for early education in this century. But it will require a bipartisan commitment from Congress to invest in our future and a belief by all Americans in the urgency of acting now.  In 1971, Congress enacted a law that provided free, universal access to early childhood services and child care for children from low-income families. President Nixon vetoed that law. In the 42 long years since then, the evidence that high-quality early learning works has multiplied many times over. But the U.S. meanwhile has fallen far behind high-achieving countries in the provision of high-quality early learning.
Our plan to expand access to high-quality programs and services, improve the competencies of early childhood educators, and promote statewide comprehensive assessment systems will require a bold commitment from the federal government with additional authorization and appropriations from Congress.  Additionally, significant coordination with HHS, state and local agencies, schools, community-based providers, early childhood stakeholders, postsecondary institutions, and other professional development providers will be required.  But the investment in high-quality early learning can fundamentally change the outcomes in children’s lives. Those who attend such programs have fewer special needs as they move through school; they get better jobs; they achieve better health; they commit fewer crimes. In turn, our nation will benefit, becoming more prosperous and globally competitive.
