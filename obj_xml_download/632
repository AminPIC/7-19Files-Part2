</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview></Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Office for Civil Rights</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>The Department, in consultation with OMB, has determined that performance toward this objective is making noteworthy progress. OCR has dramatically increased the efficiency and accuracy of the CRDC by launching a newly developed and improved data collection tool. Many new features of the data collection tool contributed to the increased efficiency and data accuracy, including the ability of LEAs and schools to (1) preview future CRDC questions that will be mandatory for the 2015–16 CRDC and to submit data voluntarily (optional) for these questions early, as part of the 2013–14 collection; (2) receive automated, customized edit checks of data entries prior to final data submission/ certification; (3) obtain individualized district feedback reports that summarize the 2013–14 data submitted; and (4) benefit from the prepopulation of some survey data items from 8 SEAs to reduce approximately 2,000 LEAs’ reporting burden. As a result, 17,000 LEAs can receive real-time summary reports of their 2013–14 CRDC data up to 8 months earlier and at least 2,000 LEAs’ burden to comply with data violation to launching an investigation by as much as one year, thus bringing speedier relief to complainants. Data for the 2013–14 CRDC will be available in the spring of 2016.

In FY 2015, OCR, in collaboration with OELA, supported major investments in the quality of the CRDC data, including the disaggregated data for ELs in all public schools. This new feature of the CRDC website allows access to individual district or school level EL profiles that include information about the demographics of EL students and their participation in early childhood, gifted and talented, AP, SAT, college and career readiness, math and science courses, and discipline. OCR worked with OELA to develop and publish the EL Toolkit to support the implementation of EL Guidance. The toolkit was launched nationally at the end of April and all ten chapters are now available online. OCR continues to promote the EL guidance and toolkit through speaking engagements and technical assistance.

In the policy arena, in FY 2015, OCR released nine guidance documents of critical importance to the Department, schools, civil rights stakeholders and the public—the most issued in one fiscal year in OCR history—concerning: (1) the Title VI requirements around resource equity and resource comparability; (2) obligations of elementary and secondary schools to respond to the bullying of SWDs; (3) schools’ obligations surrounding effective communication for SWDs; (4) questions and answers on Title IX and single-sex elementary and secondary classes and extracurricular activities; (5)&amp;nbsp;applicability of federal civil rights laws to juvenile justice residential facilities; (6)&amp;nbsp;implementing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Ebola guidance for schools; (7) schools’ obligations to ensure that EL students can participate meaningfully and equally in school and to communicate information to limited English proficient parents in a language they can understand; (8) addressing the risk of measles in schools and school obligations to SWDs medically unable to obtain vaccinations; and (9) the importance and role of Title&amp;nbsp;IX coordinators.

In order to further disseminate and deliver the message of these policy guidance documents to communities nationwide, OCR provided more than 220 technical assistance sessions to recipients and other stakeholders. These sessions were conducted by employees from all of OCR’s twelve regional and enforcement offices throughout the nation, and from headquarters, including Program Legal Group staff.

In FY 2015, OCR received a new record-high number of complaints (10,394, vs. 9,983 in FY&amp;nbsp;2014) and resolved 9,232 complaints (compared to 9,864 in FY 2014)—including a higher number of complex and systemic case resolutions than in FY 2014—despite experiencing the lowest staffing levels in OCR history (average of 539).

Additionally, OCR increased the transparency of its work to the public by making available a list of colleges and universities currently being investigated under Title IX related to sexual violence; posting hundreds of resolution agreements with educational institutions on its website; and overhauling the website to make more easily accessible information about OCR’s civil rights enforcement work (including resolution letters and agreements from FY 2014 forward); policy guidance documents; frequently asked questions about the laws OCR enforces; and a robust reading room with publications, pamphlets, and other materials. In total, there are now more than 800 cases available on the website. OCR’s customer service team responded to 7,430&amp;nbsp;hotline calls, answered 3,397 public inquiries, and fulfilled 8,775 publication requests for OCR documents to ensure the public has accurate information about civil rights laws and policy to promote equity in education.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>President Obama and Secretary Duncan have both recognized the critical importance of educational equity.[1] While equity-related objectives are infused throughout the Department’s comprehensive programs and reform initiatives, the purpose of this goal is to coordinate and promote the pursuit of educational equity across the Department, using all the levers within the Department’s power to close opportunity gaps; to get the right resources to the students who need them the most; to end discrimination, harassment, bullying, and other barriers to education; and to buttress these and other equity-related efforts through civil rights enforcement and public engagement.
 
The Department is committed to pursuing equity at all stages of education, from birth through adulthood, in institutions of early learning, K–12 schools, career and technical and postsecondary education, as well as in adult education, workforce development, and independent living programs.  The Department’s goal is to ensure that all—not just a subset—of the nation’s children, youths, and adults graduate high school and obtain the skills necessary to succeed in college, in the pursuit of a meaningful career, and in their lives.  This includes racial, ethnic, and religious minority students; low-income students; English learners; students with disabilities; girls and women; lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender students; and students who live in geographical locations with greater barriers to or fewer opportunities for an equitable education..
 
The Department also recognizes the need to systemically increase educational opportunities for underserved populations, including by exploring ways to increase equitable access to resources and effective teachers within states and districts.  While the federal government is not the primary supplier of school funding—contributing only roughly 10 percent of the total education cost at the school level—the Department is committed to exploring ways to encourage states and districts to act more vigorously to close funding and resource gaps.  Moreover, studies show that having a strong teacher is the single most important in-school contributor to a student’s success.[2]  Because of this, and regardless of how teacher effectiveness is defined, it is critical that the nation eliminate disparities between the effectiveness of teachers who serve high-need students—including low-income students, English learners, and students with disabilities—and those who do not. By fostering improved teacher evaluation systems and talent pipelines from recruitment to retention, the Department aims to elevate the teaching profession as a whole while also working to ensure that all students – no matter their zip codes – have equitable access to effective teachers.
 
Finally, civil rights enforcement is pivotal to ensuring that recipients of federal financial funding at the pre-K, K–12, and postsecondary levels eliminate acts of discrimination that, left unchecked, would otherwise negatively impact students’ achievement and access to educational opportunities.  The Department’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) uses a variety of tools to ensure compliance with federal civil rights laws, including issuing detailed policy guidance; conducting vigorous complaint investigations; procuring strong systemic remedies; pursuing aggressive monitoring of resolution agreements; launching targeted and proactive compliance reviews and technical assistance activities; collecting and publicizing school-level data on important civil rights compliance indicators; and participating in intra- and inter-agency work groups to share expertise and best practices.  OCR also engages students, parents, recipients of federal funding, and other stakeholders to inform them about applicable federal civil rights laws and policies so that they are equipped to identify and address civil rights issues at the earliest stages.
How will we measure success?  
 
The Department will use the following indicators to measure its success in increasing educational opportunities for and reducing discrimination against underserved students. The Department’s work related to equity is pervasive, and, as a result, measures related to equity are in both this section and in every other section.
 
Equity Indicators of Success
Increase the national high school graduation rate, including for poor and minority students, English learners, and students with disabilities
Increase the number of states that use effectiveness data from educator evaluation systems to ensure that poor and minority students, as well as students with disabilities and English learners, are not taught by ineffective educators at higher rates than other students
Increase the percentage of proactive civil rights investigations launched annually that address areas of concentration in civil rights enforcement
Increase the percentage of proactive investigations resolved annually that address areas of concentration in civil rights enforcement
What could hold us back?  What’s beyond our control?  (External Risk Factors)
Equity-focused efforts could be held back because of differences in availability of funding and resources at the state and local levels, some preexisting contractual obligations, the fact that state and local resources are often not targeted at the highest-need students, and the lack of necessary capacity among schools and districts to close achievement or opportunity gaps and provide needed supports for all students.  The ability to foster more equitable distribution of resources may be more difficult because of the decentralized and multi-tiered school finance system in the United States.    Further, delays in the development and implementation of high-quality educator evaluation systems could hinder the Department’s efforts in ensuring the equitable distribution of effective educators within and across schools and districts.  In addition, advancing education reform depends, in part, on the strong reauthorizations of the ESEA and other important equity-focused statutes—e.g., Perkins CTE, IDEA, and HEA.
Continuing budget cuts and reduction in staffing levels, coupled with an increase in the volume of civil rights complaints received, could compromise OCR’s ability to perform labor‑intensive proactive activities—i.e., preparing compliance reviews, providing technical assistance and outreach, and issuing important policy guidance, which help produce the greatest systemic change for students.
