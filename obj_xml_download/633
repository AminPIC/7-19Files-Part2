</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview></Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Institute of Education Sciences</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>The Department continues to focus upon providing technical assistance to the field to support the development and use of longitudinal data systems that serve the education needs of the states. In recent years a core focus for this work has been upon implementing and sustaining connections that span the complete student lifecycle. The SLDS grant program works with a State Support Team (SST) of experienced government and industry experts in the area of data systems development, connection and maintenance. The technical assistance provided by the SST is available to all states, not only to active grantees of the SLDS grant program. This level of support has enabled better conversations across states, sharing of both technical and business process best practices, and helped bring to life the number of new K-12 and postsecondary to workforce connections and P–12 to early childhood data connections that surpassed our targets for FY 2015 on both metrics.

Collaboration is key to the success of this objective. SLDS staff work frequently with other Department programs, including the ELC, as well as coordinating with Department of Labor’s Workforce Data Quality Information program. The Department continues to collaborate with technical experts, standards organizations and key stakeholders in the maintenance, enhancement and roll-out of CEDS. In FY 2015, in addition to successfully completing a new grant round and awarding 16 new SLDS grants to support collaborative data uses, a new contract was awarded to support CEDS enhancements, tools and uses over the next two years. States, postsecondary institutions and independent research groups continue to use the online CEDS tools to map their data systems, data uses and data models to CEDS.

The Department continues to model the transparency we are working to develop in the field by updating and expanding the ED Data Inventory. While work to improve the functionality and connections of the ED Data Inventory system have stalled due to budgetary limitations, the work to improve and enhance the Inventory’s content continues to move forward. Collections and reports from Department programs within seven different Principal Office Components are now represented in the Inventory. This resulted in 74 distinct publicly available datasets across the Department being connected to an Inventory entry. The Inventory continues to provide source information to data.gov on a regular basis.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Achieving the president’s 2020 college attainment goal will require better and stronger systems, powered by reliable and usable information that informs decision making, as well as by innovation.  Through this strategic plan, the Department aims to foster a culture of continuous systems improvement at the national, state, and local levels.  To achieve this goal, the Department will support robust and comprehensive data systems that produce timely, relevant, and understandable information while properly protecting student privacy; strategic use of research, evaluation, and  evidence in decision making at all levels; increased innovation; and effective and systemic use of technology.
 
The foundation for improving systemic capacity is an infrastructure that supports data-driven decision making.  Stakeholders must have access to relevant, useful data in a timely fashion, and the skills to better understand and make use of the data.  With relevant and actionable data and the ability to use it, policymakers and educators will be able to appraise how states, districts, schools, and students are currently performing; measure progress; pinpoint gaps; improve practice; better address student needs; and make sound decisions.  States are developing systems that will yield the valid, reliable data that are essential to achieving these purposes, but there is much more work to do.  The Department will continue helping states develop effective statewide longitudinal data systems, design voluntary common data standards to increase interoperability, and develop the capacity of institutions and staff to utilize data to improve teaching and learning.  These activities will help to generate an accurate picture of student performance and other critical elements, from early learning programs through postsecondary institutions and the workforce. At the same time, the Department will work through the government-wide Open Data Initiative to ensure that its own information and data are accessible to and useable by researchers, analysts, and developers in the general public.
 
Of course, the collection and use of data must be responsible and must appropriately protect student privacy.  Stewards and users of data must remember that data describe real people and ensure that systems protect the rights of those people. But there is no need to sacrifice data-driven decision making to protect student privacy, and the Department will help practitioners in the field ensure they are properly protecting privacy, and communicating with parents and students about the proper use and management of student data.
Systemic improvement also requires research and evaluation so that decision makers at the national, state, and local levels have reliable evidence to inform their actions. The Department aims to support research that will make a difference by giving states, districts, and schools the information and evidence they need to identify the effective practices they need to adopt. This research will also help them focus scarce resources on investments most likely to have the greatest impact and become more dynamic learning organizations.  In service of this, the Department will use its programmatic and research activities to incentivize the creation and use of evidence by stakeholders in the field. In addition, the Department will use evidence to inform its own policymaking and program development, and will work to communicate the findings of its research and evaluation activities to the field in an engaging and relevant way, further increasing their impact.
The goals and actions in this strategic plan sharpen the focus on the need to generate bold and creative solutions, and aim to support innovation in partnership with other federal partners and private organizations with related missions.  The Department will continue to stimulate innovations in education and provide funds needed to accelerate their design and adoption.  It also will work with Congress to fill a gap in the research and development landscape by establishing an advanced research projects agency for education to pursue breakthrough developments in ways not possible using existing Department mechanisms.
 
The Department’s vision for 21st-century learning also requires that schools have a 21st -century technology infrastructure, anchored around high-speed Internet. States, districts, and schools must have such infrastructure to incorporate cutting-edge methods for strengthening curriculum quality and delivery to meet more rigorous college- and career-ready standards; improving student access and engagement; developing comprehensive, formative, and summative assessment systems; and enhancing data management systems.
How will we measure success?  
 
The Department will use the following indicators to measure its success in enhancing the U.S. education system’s ability to continuously improve through better and more widespread use of data, research and evaluation, evidence, transparency, innovation, and technology.

What could hold us back?  What’s beyond our control?  (External Risk Factors)
 
Efforts to ensure that robust, integrated data systems are linked with early childhood, postsecondary, and workforce-level data will be constrained by the amount of time, financial resources, and support available to states to carry out this work.  State and local funding for data systems may be reduced due to continued budgetary pressures at all levels.  Moreover, wide variations in the various data systems present unique challenges for each state.  Some district data systems, for example, far surpass their own state’s data system.  Efforts to ensure that data systems lead to data-driven decision making may also encounter obstacles around privacy concerns that will need to be addressed.
 
The implementation of these strategies depends on the availability of resources for evaluation and research, which are typically more difficult to obtain than resources for services and program implementation.  In addition, many of the activities supporting this goal will be carried out by contractors and grantees, and thus are, in part, dependent on the capacity and quality of research expertise that exists outside the Department.  This variance in capacity may be more pronounced when it comes to interpreting and using evidence to drive decision making. Similarly, the evidence base regarding interventions in some areas is more robust than in others. And some grant programs focus on areas with less-developed evidence bases. At least in the short term, this could affect the amount of Department funding tied to the existence of certain levels of evidence for projects. Additionally, there are the perceived and real challenges states and districts face in implementing programs in ways that can support the strongest possible studies and evaluations of those programs. Some of these challenges can be addressed through Departmental technical assistance, but others may arise.
 
As reflected by Strategic Objective 5.2, one ongoing challenge is to protect privacy while increasing accessibility to relevant information. For its part, the Department will continue to vigilantly safeguard all personally identifiable information while also helping education agencies make useful information available. The Department also will help stakeholders develop best practices in protecting privacy while still driving data-driven decision making. But no system is perfect, and concerns about privacy may deter stakeholders from embracing the use of data, regardless of the actual level of risk presented.  Another risk lies in finding the right balance of information as too much information could make it nearly impossible to find meaning within data. To avoid this problem, the Department must work with stakeholders to prioritize information and to determine what is most likely to help families make choices for their children, help teachers improve student learning, and enable decision makers to improve education institutions.
 
Education funding faces tremendous budgetary pressure across the country, putting investment in new programs, strategies, or processes at risk.  In this time of decreasing budgets, technology infrastructure and other innovations might be seen as luxuries rather than as mission critical.  Because the private sector currently does not find investment in education innovation as attractive as investment in innovation in other sectors, there is limited private funding to help bridge the gaps.  And the promise of technology might be affected by variance in the capacity of states, districts, and schools to plan, implement, and support modern technology networks.
 
[1] “New competitive grant dollars that reward evidence” includes all dollars awarded based on the existence of at least “evidence of promise” in support of a project, per the framework in the Education Department General Administrative Regulations (34 CFR Part 75). Consideration of such evidence appears through: eligibility threshold (e.g., in the Investing in Innovation program); absolute priority; competitive priority (earning at least one point for it); or selection criteria (earning at least one point for it). The percentage is calculated compared to the total new grant dollars awarded, excluding awards made by the Institute of Education Sciences, the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research, and technical assistance centers, with some exceptions.
