</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview></Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Risk Management Service; Office of the Chief Financial Officer </Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>Risk management focuses on creating an environment where grant and loan funds are used for the right purpose and achieve program success. The Department has worked to increase its ability to provide the right technical assistance and oversight to help grantees achieve program goals. Some of that work is accomplished through improving the quality and thoroughness of risk assessments conducted by the Department assuring that grantees are ready to manage the funds awarded. During FY 2015 the Department conducted preaward risk reviews for 100&amp;nbsp;percent of competitive grant programs. Other work has included improving the program staffs’ skills in the area of fiscal monitoring through training and technical assistance. In FY&amp;nbsp;2015, the Department far exceeded its goal of timely audit resolution—the target was set at no more than 43 percent resolved overdue, and the actual percentage achieved was 20&amp;nbsp;percent. This was achieved by focusing on timeliness and fostering close working relationships with programs and support offices. In addition, a comprehensive training program to support the implementation of the new Uniform Guidance was developed and implemented for both grantees and Department staff, which included a strand on audit-related requirements.

Risk management is also an essential aspect of contract monitoring, which is achieved by actively assessing program and performance risks inherent in contracts through oversight and support and issuance of policy and guidance to program and contract officials. The Department has sustained high performance in compliance with contractor performance reporting requirements, leading the government with a 98 percent compliance rate for FY 2015. Only four agencies reached a compliance rate of 90 percent in FY 2015, and the average compliance rate of all 64 agencies reported was only 30 percent.[1]

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>To successfully implement this strategic plan, the Department must retool its organizational capabilities and areas of expertise. In particular, transforming the Department means developing a new approach to workforce and succession planning, and raising the competency levels of the employees using a strategic, disciplined and structured approach. To ensure the achievement of mission critical objectives, grants and contract management will be a strategic focus for improvement in long and short-term initiatives. These initiatives will strive to better support grantees in achieving their educational goals while also continuing to hold grantees accountable for meeting financial requirements and legal obligations. To do so, the Department will continue to build the skills and knowledge of its workforce, rethink how it monitors and intervenes with high-risk grantees as well as contractors, enhance workforce productivity through information technology and performance management, and transform the way the Department interacts with states, districts, institutions of higher education, and other grantees across the country. The transformation will result in improved performance results, increased stakeholder collaboration, and higher employee engagement.
How will we measure success?  
The Department will use the following indicators to measure the Department’s success in building the organizational capacities needed to implement this strategic plan.
U.S. Department of Education Capacity Indicators of Success
Decrease staffing gaps percentage
Increase the Employee Viewpoint Survey’s employee  engagement index rating
Increase the Employee Viewpoint Survey’s performance culture index rating
Increase the Employee Viewpoint Survey’s leadership and knowledge management index rating
Decrease percentage of A-133 single audits overdue for resolution
Increase compliance rate of contractor evaluation performance reports
Increase percentage of states that annually rate the Department’s technical assistance as helping build state capacity to implement education reforms
Decrease number of ED IT security incidents
Decrease time to hire
Increase effective communication index rating
Decrease ED’s space footprint across the real property portfolio
What could hold us back?  What’s beyond our control?  (External Risk Factors)
To be successful, these human capital initiatives will require support from the Department’s supervisors, managers, and senior leaders.  It will also require updates to internal policies and a strong, productive collaboration with the employees’ union.  In addition, the Department will need to improve upon its commitment to meaningful professional development and succession planning programs as well as the implementation of new technology to support improved collaboration among staff as well as with our grantees and partners.
Risk is inherent in the grants as well as contract management processes; therefore, no amount of improvement will completely eliminate risk.  Risk is greater in areas of innovation, where there are fewer precedents, proven strategies, or track records upon which to draw in the assessment and management of risk.  Data limitations and lack of timeliness can impede the Department’s efforts in managing risk. Implementing unprecedented reform efforts will require states to develop new capacities that support effective teaching, school turnarounds, college- and career-ready standards, and effective use of data.  In addition, states must develop new capacities to communicate and collaborate with each other to share effective practices.  As with many other efforts, states’ abilities to develop and implement these systems may be in jeopardy given the budget environment impacting states and districts.
Maximizing the impact of the Department’s human capital and funding resources may be limited by several factors, including the lack of timely data for analysis.  Additionally, a lack of resources to leverage new technologies and integrate data may limit the Department’s and its grantees’ ability to improve productivity.  These limitations can create challenges for the pace at which new innovations, both technological and others can be developed and deployed.
