</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview></Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Office of Elementary and Secondary Education</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>2015 was the first year of implementation for OESE’s new Office of State Support (OSS). The reorganization was approved in the fourth quarter of FY 2014 and OSS was created in early October. OSS is designed to provide improved state-centered support across related Department programs and offer more transparent, higher quality, and better differentiated support to meet the varies needs among states. The matrix organization model adopted by OSS ensures that a state has a primary contact within the Department and this individual serves as the liaison across key state-administered grant programs and major federal funding streams that flow to each state and district. By consolidating processes and technical assistance, the Department will be able to more effectively customize its outreach to individual states and model the critical partnerships that states should have with their respective districts.

The office is working to deepen staff knowledge and build or pilot systems and routines that allow OSS to support states with implementation through a systemic approach to technical assistance and the design and implementation of key processes, such as performance management and knowledge management, in order to ensure sustainability.

Educator equity is one area of increased attention and support during the past year. In July 2014, the Department announced the Excellent Educators for All initiative designed to move America toward the day when every student in every public school is taught by excellent educators. An EASN was set up to provide support and technical assistance to states to ensure that they had strong plans and targeted strategies so that&amp;nbsp; students in poverty and minority children are not taught at higher rates than other children by inexperienced, unqualified, or out-of-field teachers.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>To successfully implement this strategic plan, the Department must retool its organizational capabilities and areas of expertise. In particular, transforming the Department means developing a new approach to workforce and succession planning, and raising the competency levels of the employees using a strategic, disciplined and structured approach. To ensure the achievement of mission critical objectives, grants and contract management will be a strategic focus for improvement in long and short-term initiatives. These initiatives will strive to better support grantees in achieving their educational goals while also continuing to hold grantees accountable for meeting financial requirements and legal obligations. To do so, the Department will continue to build the skills and knowledge of its workforce, rethink how it monitors and intervenes with high-risk grantees as well as contractors, enhance workforce productivity through information technology and performance management, and transform the way the Department interacts with states, districts, institutions of higher education, and other grantees across the country. The transformation will result in improved performance results, increased stakeholder collaboration, and higher employee engagement.
How will we measure success?  
The Department will use the following indicators to measure the Department’s success in building the organizational capacities needed to implement this strategic plan.
U.S. Department of Education Capacity Indicators of Success

Increase the Employee Viewpoint Survey’s employee  engagement index rating
Increase the Employee Viewpoint Survey’s performance culture index rating
Increase the Employee Viewpoint Survey’s leadership and knowledge management index rating
Decrease percentage of A-133 single audits overdue for resolution
Increase compliance rate of contractor evaluation performance reports
Increase percentage of states that annually rate the Department’s technical assistance as helping build state capacity to implement education reforms
Decrease number of ED IT security incidents
Decrease time to hire
Increase effective communication index rating
Decrease ED’s space footprint across the real property portfolio
What could hold us back?  What’s beyond our control?  (External Risk Factors)
To be successful, these human capital initiatives will require support from the Department’s supervisors, managers, and senior leaders.  It will also require updates to internal policies and a strong, productive collaboration with the employees’ union.  In addition, the Department will need to improve upon its commitment to meaningful professional development and succession planning programs as well as the implementation of new technology to support improved collaboration among staff as well as with our grantees and partners.
Risk is inherent in the grants as well as contract management processes; therefore, no amount of improvement will completely eliminate risk.  Risk is greater in areas of innovation, where there are fewer precedents, proven strategies, or track records upon which to draw in the assessment and management of risk.  Data limitations and lack of timeliness can impede the Department’s efforts in managing risk. Implementing unprecedented reform efforts will require states to develop new capacities that support effective teaching, school turnarounds, college- and career-ready standards, and effective use of data.  In addition, states must develop new capacities to communicate and collaborate with each other to share effective practices.  As with many other efforts, states’ abilities to develop and implement these systems may be in jeopardy given the budget environment impacting states and districts.
Maximizing the impact of the Department’s human capital and funding resources may be limited by several factors, including the lack of timely data for analysis.  Additionally, a lack of resources to leverage new technologies and integrate data may limit the Department’s and its grantees’ ability to improve productivity.  These limitations can create challenges for the pace at which new innovations, both technological and others can be developed and deployed.
