</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>Expanding the bioeconomy creates economic opportunities and improves the environment.&amp;nbsp; Biomass from farms, forests, and rangelands could supply a significant portion of U.S. transportation fuels, heat, power, and biobased products.&amp;nbsp; Research, development, and demonstration are necessary to realize the potential of biomass resources.&amp;nbsp; USDA efforts in this area will help reduce investor risk, support market development, and contribute to energy security, environmental quality, and economic opportunity.&amp;nbsp; USDA’s efforts will include:


	Creating viable engineering, business, and financial protocols to evaluate proposed commercial renewable energy and energy efficiency projects;
	Developing superior genetic feedstocks and production and logistic systems suited to regional conditions;
	Developing advanced biomass crops and methods for their sustainable production as biofuels and other forms of biopower; and
	Providing analysis and data about commodity markets for renewable energy sources; and


USDA will create bio-economy opportunities for farmers, ranchers, forest landowners, small businesses, rural utilities, Tribal governments, and rural municipalities by providing financial and technical assistance and leveraging investments of other Federal agencies and industry.&amp;nbsp; By facilitating commercialization of bio-based products, USDA will work to create green jobs and investment opportunities and expand support for commercial deployment of wind, solar, geothermal, hydro and ocean resources.&amp;nbsp; USDA will:


	Support expanding production of advanced biofuels through the financing of the widespread deployment of full-scale commercial facilities;
	Support the development of integrated regional systems for the sustainable production of biofuels, biopower, and biobased products;
	Integrate renewable energy and biobased product feedstock production into sustainable agriculture, forest, and range management systems; and
	Support the establishment and production of annual and non-woody perennial crops and woody biomass crops for conversion to bioenergy and biobased products.


USDA education programs use the Nation’s public institutions, private sector partners, and the Land-Grant University System to promote and expand the workforce needed to grow the bioeconomy.&amp;nbsp; USDA also has a role in educating the general public and international partners through capacity building programs, on the benefits and costs of bioenergy production and use from economic, environmental, social and sustainability perspectives.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office></Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>In 2015, USDA invested $100 million in the Biofuel Infrastructure Partnership (BIP), a partnership between the Government and States and private partners, to install nearly 5,000 pumps offering higher blends of ethanol nationwide. With the matching commitments by State and private entities, the BIP is investing a total of $210 million to nearly double the number of fueling pumps nationwide that supply renewable fuels to American motorists. These investments will help to create new markets for agricultural commodities, support demand and increase prices paid to farmers.

Aso, in FY 2015 USDA investments in renewable energy resulted in 85,937 million kilowatt hours generated in rural America from alternative energy sources including 1,019 kilowatt hours generated through investments from Rural Development’s Rural Business Services programs and 84,918 kilowatt hours generated through investments from Rural Utilities Service programs. In FY 2015 USDA was also on target to procure $10 million in bio-based products.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>USDA is the leading Government advocate for rural America and agricultural production.  By improving rural prosperity, increasing opportunities for agriculture, and expanding the bio-economy USDA is striving to create thriving communities where people want to live and raise families and where children have a bright future. To achieve this, the Department is helping to make an impact on persistent poverty, out-migration, and rural income.
Persistent poverty.  About one out of every sixteen persons in the U.S. lives in deep poverty, with an income below 50 percent of the federal poverty line.  Poverty and lack of opportunity are especially acute in rural regions and can become entrenched.  USDA’s Economic Research Service defines a persistent poverty county as one in which 20 percent or more of its population has lived in poverty over the past 30 years.  Eighty-five percent of persistent poverty counties are rural.[1]  While about 14 percent of America’s children live in rural areas, 18 percent of children in poverty live in rural areas.
Out-migration.  Although export opportunities and agricultural revenue are at historic highs, rural America is losing population.  Some rural areas have experienced population loss for decades. However, 2010 to 2012 was the first period where rural America as a whole lost population.  Causes include unemployment, housing-market challenges, energy sector developments, and other factors. Out-migration often includes the loss of highly educated individuals to regions with greater economic opportunity.  Out-migration depletes the economic base of the region and discourages outside investment in infrastructure and other resources needed to attract good paying jobs.
Rural income levels.  Adequate and stable income levels are a vital contributor to rural prosperity.  Median household income in rural areas was 78.6 percent of the suburban and urban median in 2011, although the generally lower cost of living in rural areas narrows this gap in real terms.  Median total household income increased each year from 2008 to 2011 and is projected to continue to trend upwards.   Economic opportunities in rural areas are important to continue this positive trend.
