</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>Clean and abundant water is essential for healthy ecosystems, sustainable agricultural and forest production, livable communities, and viable industry.&amp;nbsp; Eighty seven percent of America's surface supply of drinking water originates on our Nation’s forests, farms, and range lands. The National Forest System alone is the source of fresh water for more than 60 million people.

USDA helps protect and enhance water quality through its work in national forests and grasslands and by supporting the efforts of private landowners and communities. Assessing water resource vulnerability nationally and investing in high impact watershed improvement projects ensures strategic use of USDA resources. USDA will also increase watershed-based partnerships with Tribes, States, communities, landowners, and other stakeholders to improve watershed management.

To restore and protect head-waters and wetlands in the national forests and grasslands, USDA will implement integrated watershed restoration.&amp;nbsp; This will be based on a national assessment of watershed conditions and restoration needs established in the Watershed Condition Framework.

USDA will deliver financial and technical assistance to land owners to implement conservation measures and management strategies to benefit water quality and availability, conserve water, and improve watershed health.&amp;nbsp; The Department will work with landowners to protect wetlands and implement soil health management systems that mitigate the impacts of extreme weather.&amp;nbsp; Working with Federal and State partners, USDA will assist private landowners who are improving water quality to achieve regulatory certainty.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office></Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>ACHIEVEMENTS: In FY 2015,&amp;nbsp;The Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) assisted with the application of over 31 million acres of conservation practices to improve water quality. For the past four years (FY 2012 through FY 2015), NRCS embarked on the Integrated Resource Restoration (IRR) pilot program, realigning the agency’s budget structure with the goal of increasing efficiency and flexibility to perform integrated watershed protection and landscape-scale restoration.

USDA will continue to increase opportunities to collaborate across ownership boundaries and within programs, using the lessons learned to gain the benefits realized through the (Integrated Resource RestorationI) RR pilot programs.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>National forests and private working lands provide clean air, clean and abundant water, and wildlife habitat.  These lands sustain jobs and produce food, fiber, timber, and bio-based energy.  Many of our landscapes are scenic and culturally important and provide Americans a chance to enjoy the outdoors.  To sustain these many benefits, USDA works with private landowners to protect and enhance 1.3 billion acres of working lands and manages 193 million acres of national forests and grasslands.  The Department uses an “all-lands” approach to bring people together across ecosystems and property boundaries.  This increases the scale, pace, and effectiveness of conservation and restoration.  Our partners include Federal, Tribal, and state governments; industry; non-governmental organizations, community groups and producers.  Our lands face increasing threats that must be addressed.  USDA’s natural resource-focused strategies are designed to make substantial contributions in the areas described below.
Soil health.  There is a need to grow more food on a shrinking available land base, as global food demand rises and agricultural land is developed for other uses.  From 1982 to 2007, approximately 23 million acres of agricultural land was lost to development.  Improved soil health helps us use available land most productively and increases water quality, resilience to extreme weather, and carbon sequestration.  Soil loss from erosion is one important metric for monitoring soil health.
Climate change.  Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing the U.S. and the world.  Producers are increasingly faced with extreme weather events, ranging from drought to flood. The agriculture sector accounts for 7 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.  Forests and other lands absorb approximately 14 percent of emissions.  However, recent studies project that the forest carbon sink could become a net source of carbon emissions in the next few decades.[1] This decline is primarily due to conversion of forest land area to urban and other developed land uses.
Water quality.  Protecting and improving the nation’s water resources is a priority. In an assessment of the nation’s rivers and streams released by the Environmental Protection Agency, 23 percent of the nation’s river and stream length was rated to be in fair condition, and 55 percent in poor condition.
