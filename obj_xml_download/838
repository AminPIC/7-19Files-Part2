USDA’s domestic nutrition assistance programs serve one in four Americans annually. The Department is committed to making benefits available to every eligible person who wishes to participate in the major nutrition assistance programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the Child Nutrition Programs, and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). &amp;nbsp;While the Department’s ultimate objective is for economic opportunities to make nutrition assistance unnecessary for as many families as possible, we will ensure that these vital programs remain ready to serve all eligible people who need them.

While the rate of SNAP participation among eligible people has returned to the coverage levels of the 1990s, a substantial portion of those eligible for SNAP are not participating. USDA will continue its efforts to ensure that every eligible person is aware of the program’s benefits so that they can make an informed choice whether to participate or not.

USDA also intends to ensure effective and easy access to the Child Nutrition Programs for eligible children who need them. The National School Lunch Program is available in most schools. Schools can receive cash subsidies and donated commodities from the Department for each meal they serve. In return, those schools must serve lunches that meet Federal requirements and offer free or reduced-price lunches to eligible children.

Promoting access to nutrition assistance goes hand-in-hand with managing these programs in a manner that ensures public confidence and maximizes the impact of Federal dollars. Strong management ensures that those most in need of nutrition assistance receive it. It also ensures that nutrition assistance programs leverage opportunities to positively impact the local economy in the communities they serve. Finally, it ensures that resources are not wasted by error or abuse. USDA uses all available opportunities, including new communication and eGovernment technologies, to serve customers, work with partners, and administer programs as effectively as possible.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office></Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>ACHIEVEMENTS:&amp;nbsp; In FY 2015, USDA continued to improve the quality of Americans’ diets through research-based nutrition enhancements to the Nation’s food supply and better knowledge and education to promote healthier food choices. In FY 2015, USDA pursued national policies and programs to ensure that everyone has access to a healthy diet regardless of income, and that information is available to support and encourage good nutrition choices.

CHALLENGES:&amp;nbsp; The Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) is still reaching only a fraction of the children in need of nutrition assistance when school is out.&amp;nbsp; Challenges include outreach to eligible children, identifying viable site sponsors and transportation of food. &amp;nbsp;

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>A plentiful supply of safe and nutritious food is essential to the well-being of every family and the healthy development of every child in America. Science has established strong links between diet, health, and productivity.  Even small improvements in the average diet may yield significant health and economic benefits.  Yet we know that for many American families, food and nutrition issues remain serious problems.
Food insecurity.  While most American households have access at all times to enough nutritious food for an active and healthy lifestyle, food insecurity and the risk of hunger remain serious problems. The latest data show that over 17 million American households, including over 8 million households with children, had difficulty putting enough food on the table at some point during 2011. Even more alarming, in more than 350,000 households, with more than 800,000 children, one or more children simply did not get enough to eat.  At times during the year, these children were hungry, skipped meals, or went whole days without food.
Poor diet and obesity.  Poor dietary habits and a lack of physical activity contribute to serious health conditions, perhaps the most troubling of these conditions is childhood obesity.  Over the last 30 years, the childhood obesity rate has more than tripled.[1] This has serious implications for the Nation’s future. Children who start out life obese have greater struggles with their weight in later years. In fact, 80 percent of teenagers who are obese remain obese as adults and are at risk for coronary heart disease, hypertension, and heightened risk of stroke, diabetes, and some cancers.[2]  This has serious implications for the Nation’s future.  Beyond the physical suffering such diseases cause, obesity-related health complications can increase medical costs to America’s health care system and decrease overall productivity.
Food safety.  While the US food supply system is one of the safest in the world, foodborne illness is still a common, costly—yet largely preventable—public health problem.  Many different disease‑causing microbes, or pathogens, can contaminate foods, so there are many different foodborne infections.  Today, as many as one in six Americans experience a foodborne illness annually[3], meaning they get sick by consuming contaminated foods or beverages.
