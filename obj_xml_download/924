</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>The SBA makes training and leadership development a priority.&amp;nbsp; The Office of Human Resources Solutions develops strategic human capital solutions to workforce issues and strives to create a work environment that attracts and retains the talented and high-performing workforce the Agency needs in order to accomplish its mission.&amp;nbsp; Attracting high quality employees is just the start of the process; establishing work-life balance and delivering training and leadership opportunities helps staff thrive in the workplace and effectively serve small businesses.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Office of Human Resource Solutions</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>The SBA Office of Human Resources Solutions (OHRS) engaged in consultation with hiring managers to clarify their mission requirements and target recruiting efforts.&amp;nbsp; The applicant pools were better aligned with SBA’s needs, which resulted in an average time to hire of 97 days, which is three days below the Agency’s target of 100 days.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, strengthened collaboration with hiring managers concerning special hiring authorities resulted in a larger pool of highly qualified candidates.&amp;nbsp; The SBA also deepened its understanding of employee perspectives by conducting themed snapshot surveys (e.g., recommending SBA as a Great Place to Work), as a continuation of OPM’s FEVS.&amp;nbsp; The Agency’s current efforts are focused on supporting strategies to increase the Employee Engagement Index score to 67 percent by the end of FY 2017 to meet the President’s employee engagement goal.
