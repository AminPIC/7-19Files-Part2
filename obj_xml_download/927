</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>The SBA plays a critical role in the Administration’s ongoing efforts to reduce regulatory barriers to entrepreneurship, innovation, and American competitiveness.&amp;nbsp; As part of the Start-Up America initiative, government leaders met with more than 1,000 entrepreneurs across the country to talk about ways to reduce barriers for small business growth.&amp;nbsp; These conversations continue to guide SBA policy and programmatic decisions.&amp;nbsp; In addition, SBA’s National Ombudsman plays a key role in helping small business owners deal with specific regulatory burdens and challenges that result from federal agency processes.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, the SBA is focused on and committed to not only compiling internal SBA data to inform programmatic decisions, but also partnering with the key federal agencies to gather the most robust data sets to make informed policy.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Office of the National Ombudsman</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>The SBA continued its progress in reducing undue regulatory burdens on the small business community.&amp;nbsp; The Agency exceeded its performance targets to broaden outreach to and assist small businesses.&amp;nbsp; Attention focused on three additional priority areas: (1) identification and resolution of systemic regulatory barriers to small business success and growth; (2) growing the diversity and engagement of the Regional Regulatory Fairness Boards through strategic appointments; and (3) strengthening partnerships with stakeholders.&amp;nbsp; The SBA experienced a decrease in membership on the Regulatory Fairness Boards but exceeded its goal for small business outreach through events including meetings, roundtables, and hearings with small business owners in all ten SBA regions. &amp;nbsp;Building on these accomplishments, the Agency will make critical improvements to its case management infrastructure to boost user experience, program capacity, and impact.&amp;nbsp;
