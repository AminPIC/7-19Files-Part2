</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>Our recent emphasis on ecosystem approaches to determining the environmental impact of transportation projects has promoted broader mitigation and conservation strategies.&amp;nbsp; However, the Nation’s investments in transportation systems and infrastructure will only be sustainable if we more broadly consider the secondary effects of construction and land use.&amp;nbsp; Although transportation projects comply with requirements for management of stormwater runoff, and federal funds are available for restoration activities, more must be done to meet the challenge of reducing transportation’s contribution to water quality problems.&amp;nbsp; We must balance this need against the demand for faster project delivery time, which is often determined by the environmental permitting process.&amp;nbsp; We will work to improve internal project delivery processes and identify opportunities for enhanced interagency harmonization, through continued DOT initiatives, implementing Executive Order 13604 to streamline infrastructure projects, and other related efforts.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office></Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>The Department is working to address and mitigate environmental impacts of transportation.

DOT has met three of the four&amp;nbsp;targets for which current data is available. Key results include:


	Reductions in number of people exposed to high aviation sound levels;
	Continued progress with MARAD ship disposal.


Although PHMSA did not meet its target for reducing hazardous pipeline spills, the number of pipeline spills with environmental consequence continued to go down.

Key efforts include:


	FAA's promotion of noise reduction technologies through its CLEEN Program;
	Refinement of PHMSA's hazardous pipeline spills to focus on those with environmental consequence in order to more set more aggressive targets; and
	Maintaining an expeditious ship disposal rate of the obsolete, government-owned ships in Suisun Bay.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Transportation is crucial to our economy and our quality of life, but building, operating, and maintaining transportation systems clearly have significant environmental impacts on our air, water, and natural ecosystems. The transportation sector is a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, accounting for 27 percent of total U.S. GHG emissions in 2011.  We will address these challenges through strategies such as fuel economy standards for cars and trucks, more environmentally sound construction and operational practices, and expanding opportunities for shifting freight from less fuel-efficient modes to more fuel-efficient modes.
