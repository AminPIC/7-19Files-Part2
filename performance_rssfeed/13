    <description>&lt;p&gt;OPM&#039;s mission is to recruit, retain, and honor a world-class workforce to serve the American people. To focus our efforts, OPM developed the goals and strategies contained in the updated &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opm.gov/about-us/budget-performance/strategic-plans/2014-2018-strategic-plan.pdf&quot; title=&quot;2014-2018-strategic-plan&quot;&gt;2014 – 2018 Strategic Plan – Recruit, Retain, and Honor. (PDF file)&lt;/a&gt; [1.19 MB]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Office of Personnel Management exists to support and strengthen the Federal workforce. As such, we strive to be a model of employee engagement, diversity and inclusion, and workforce development so that all our people feel connected to our mission and responsibly empowered to serve our stakeholders. At OPM, we encourage open, honest and direct dialogue between and among supervisors and employees—genuine, respectful dialogue that values diversity of thought to enable creativity and innovation. We expect supervisors and their teams to be mutually accountable for providing world-class customer service and consistently excellent results. Above all, we are committed to building trust in OPM by listening to those we serve, collaborating with our colleagues, utilizing our collective expertise, and analyzing our results so we may continuously improve. Only by working together in this way can we truly recruit, retain, and honor a world-class workforce to serve the American people.&lt;/p&gt;
