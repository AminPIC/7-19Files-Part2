    <title>Transition to Veterans</title>
    <link>https://www.performance.gov/Transition%20to%20Veterans</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;With America&#039;s involvement in Afghanistan winding down, there is a large influx of returning Service members and veterans transitioning to civilian life. To better support all Service members, DoD transformed its Wounded Warrior Agency Priority Goal from Fiscal Years 2012-2013 to an Agency Priority Goal (APG) focused on Transition to Veterans.  Transition to Veterans is a top DoD priority, and the Department wants to ensure our men and women in uniform are fully equipped for life after their military Service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, the Department has identified four programmatic goals that best reflect transition to veterans.  These goals include: By September 30, 2015 DoD  will improve the career readiness of Service Members’ transitioning to Veteran status by:  1)  ensuring at least 85% of eligible Service Members complete required transition activities prior to separation: pre-separation counseling, a Department of Labor (DoL) employment workshop, and Veterans Affairs’ benefits briefings; 2) verifying that at least 85% of separating service members meet  newly established Career Readiness Standards prior to separation; 3)  accelerating the transition of recovering Service Members into Veteran status by reducing disability evaluation processing time; and 4)  supporting the seamless transition of recovering Service Members by sharing active recovery plans with the VA.&lt;/p&gt;
