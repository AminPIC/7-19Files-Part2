    <description>&lt;p&gt;Improve the timeliness of initiation into treatment for individuals with serious mental illness.  By September 30, 2017, expand the availability of evidence-based early intervention services for individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) funded through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Community Mental Health Services Block Grant by increasing the number of states with at least one evidence-based early intervention program that provides a team-based approach to treatment including services such as case management, recovery-oriented cognitive and behavioral skills training, supported employment, supported education services, family education and support, and low doses of medications when indicated.  The goal is to increase by 130 percent from a baseline of 13 states in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
