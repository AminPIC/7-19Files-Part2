In so doing, decision makers can develop better outreach and recruitment methods; determine what factors contribute to the retention of a talented workforce; experience cost savings through decreased attrition; and create an inclusive work environment that empowers employees to contribute to their full potential. By September 30, 2015, 95 percent of OPM and 25 percent of government-wide hiring actions will occur following human resource and/or hiring manager’s use of a tool that reveals applicant flow data from prior recruitment efforts.&amp;nbsp; This tool will assist human resource and/or hiring managers in planning their strategic recruitment efforts, resulting in measurable improvements in the recruitment and outreach to underrepresented communities and manager satisfaction with the quality of new hires.
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>OPM is responsible for the Government-wide Diversity and Inclusion effort focused on developing, driving, and monitoring strategies and initiatives designed to create a more diverse and inclusive Federal workforce.&amp;nbsp; Executive Order 13583, “Establishing a Coordinated Government-wide Initiative to Promote Diversity and Inclusion in the Federal Workforce,” challenged the Federal Government with leading by example and attaining a diverse, qualified workforce that enables employees to contribute to their full potential.&amp;nbsp; Similarly, Executive Order 13548, “Increasing Federal Employment of Individuals with Disabilities,” requires agencies to improve their efforts to employ Federal workers with disabilities and targeted disabilities through increased recruitment, hiring, and retention of these individuals.

In FY 2012, OPM issued the Government-wide Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan to provide direction to fifty-seven participating departments and agencies under the two subject Executive Orders.&amp;nbsp; The three primary goals in the Plan included:


	Workforce Diversity. Recruit from a diverse, qualified group of potential applicants to secure a high-performing workforce drawn from all segments of American society;
	Workplace Inclusion. Cultivate a culture that encourages collaboration, flexibility, and fairness to enable individuals to contribute to their full potential and further retention; and
	Sustainability. Develop structures and strategies to equip leaders with the ability to manage diversity, be accountable, measure results, refine approaches on the basis of such data, and institutionalize a culture of inclusion.


In support of the Diversity goal, OPM seeks to improve applicant flow reporting to enable human resources staff and hiring managers to determine whether recruitment efforts have been successful in drawing from all segments of society and to aid in developing future recruitment strategy.&amp;nbsp; Applicant flow data has historically been collected on the basis of race, national origin, and sex, and beginning in 2014, it will be collected on the basis of disability.&amp;nbsp; Historically, the data has been analyzed in an aggregate format; however, through the use of business intelligence tools, applicant flow data for individual hiring actions will be available for review at the hiring manager level after a vacancy has closed, creating incentive for increased hiring manager involvement in the recruitment process and greater opportunity for planning future recruitment efforts.

To further understand how to create an inclusive work environment where employees are fully engaged and productive, OPM and the Department of Veterans Affairs conducted factor analysis on the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey and found that twenty questions cluster into five areas or behaviors (i.e., fair, open, cooperative, supportive, and empowering) that create inclusive work environments.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Based on these five areas, OPM developed the “New IQ” (Inclusion Quotient) techniques and training to assist managers and supervisors in practicing behaviors that foster inclusion, an antecedent to employee engagement.&amp;nbsp; OPM will also continue to focus on the life cycle of the Federal employee to ensure that the Federal workforce is able to hire and develop the best talent from all segments of society, with a focus on internal Diversity and Inclusion efforts to ensure that we serve as a model agency.&amp;nbsp; Internal efforts will focus on the implementation of a data-driven, habit formation strategy that leverages first-line managers and supervisors to foster inclusion and engagement in the OPM workplace.

In FY 2015, OPM refined its approach to applicant flow data, resulting in more targeted and actionable analyses.&amp;nbsp; FY 2014 was the first year that the agency systematically reviewed the data, and looked at it overall – across all positions together.&amp;nbsp; In FY 2015, OPM began to look at the data by occupation, focusing on three occupations with the greatest hiring volume.&amp;nbsp; Towards the end of the year, OPM added three additional occupations.&amp;nbsp; For the year overall, OPM hiring managers reviewed applicant flow data for 60.7 percent of USA Staffing hiring actions.&amp;nbsp; While OMP did not meet the target of 95 percent, applicant flow data is now part of the new OPM HR dashboard and more accessible to associate directors and office heads.

Government-wide, managers and/or Human Resources reviewed applicant flow data for 76.6 percent of USAJOBS hiring actions, exceeding the target of 25 percent due to increased efforts in FY 2015 to make applicant flow data available to more USA Staffing customers.

In 2014, minorities constituted 35.3 percent of the Federal workforce, compared to 34.1 percent in FY 2011; and people with disabilities, including 30 percent or more disabled veterans, represented 12.8 percent of the Federal workforce, reflecting the highest percentage of people with disabilities in Federal service in the past 33 years.&amp;nbsp; Diversity within the Senior Executive Service (SES) also improved, with, for example, women comprising 33.7 percent of the SES, compared to 32.2 percent in FY 2011. With respect to inclusion, data shows that departments and agencies made progress with respect to one facet of OPM’s New Inclusion Quotient (New IQ) (a data-driven strategy that teaches first-line supervisors techniques and behaviors that foster inclusion.)&amp;nbsp; Specifically, the 2015 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) data reflects that employees’ positive perceptions of supervisors have increased, with 81 percent reporting that their supervisors treat them with respect, 76 percent feeling that their supervisors listen to what they have to say, and 61 percent agreeing that that their supervisors provide constructive suggestions to improve their performance. OPM will continue to focus internal and Government-wide Diversity and Inclusion efforts on employing data-driven strategies through tools like applicant flow data and the New IQ techniques and through collaboration among agencies on implementation of agency-specific Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plans.


	New IQ training is ongoing for OPM managers and employees. As of September 30, 2015, 87 percent of OPM managers have been trained in the New IQ. OPM employees are strongly encouraged to take this training.
	More than 10,250 human resource and hiring managers have taken the new online course entitled, “A Roadmap to Success: Hiring, Retaining and Including People with Disabilities.” Training is ongoing.
	OPM has launched recruitment and outreach training for SES, managers, and supervisors.
	The agency has launched pilot social media recruiting via LinkedIn with OPM HR staff.
	OPM developed a Habit Scan, a survey where managers are asked how many inclusive habits or activities they have engaged in.
	The agency developed a Simple Pledge in which our senior leaders identify two to four commitments related to diversity, inclusion, engagement, and employee development.
	Chief Human Capitol Officers and Deputy Chief Human Capitol Officers were trained on the New IQ. Additionally, 57 agencies have been briefed on their New IQ scores, and OPM is providing technical assistance on administering the New IQ training in their departments and agencies if they’re not already doing so. 39 of the 57 agencies have received specific technical assistance on the New IQ to create Game Changer experts.
	OPM established a Government-wide Diversity and Inclusion Council in March 2015.&amp;nbsp; Through the Council, OPM will develop guidance to cultivate an organizational workplace culture that supports inclusion, employee engagement, transparency, information sharing, cognitive diversity, and equity for all Federal employees.
	The Recruitment, Engagement, Diversity and Inclusion (REDI) Roadmap was rolled out in March 2015. The REDI Roadmap is a comprehensive data-driven, forward-looking human capital management strategy to transform the way the Federal Government attracts, recruits, hires, engages and develops its workforce for the 21st&amp;nbsp;century, and purposely infuses diversity and inclusion throughout the strategies.

</progress_update><themes><theme>General Government</theme></themes><contributing_programs_and_other_factors>All OPM organizations have a role in the recruitment of a diverse and talented workforce.&amp;nbsp; Implementation of this strategy is dependent on the Employee Services (ES) (OPM human resources) staff, in coordination with the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, to provide program management, policy, guidance, and communication and coordination with hiring managers and employees.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, ES’ Veterans Employment Program Office supports the recruitment and outreach to the veterans’ community.&amp;nbsp; The goal also requires the work of Planning and Policy Analysis (PPA) which is responsible for conducting the annual Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (EVS) and the participation and support of managers at all levels of the agency.

Because this strategy involves leveraging social media and technology, it requires access to social media through official OPM accounts and the support of the Office of Communications. Additionally, the specific recruitment and outreach approaches outlined will require the support of OPM employees, who will extend the outreach of the agency.&amp;nbsp; Dashboard and data analysis tools, along with analytical expertise, are required for ongoing monitoring and feedback.

If agency hiring continues to be extremely constrained by budget limitations, the impact of this goal on the composition of the workforce is similarly constrained.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, without broad hiring, the generalizability of applicant flow data is limited and the results may not be representative of the agency as a whole. For example, if the agency only hires in one location, organization, or occupation, the data cannot be meaningfully extended to represent hypothetical agency-wide hiring, but rather only reflect those limited conditions.

OGC provides legal advice, renders opinions, reviews proposed policies and other work products and comments on their legal efficacy, serves as agency representatives in administrative litigation, and supports the Department of Justice in its representation of the Government on matters concerning the civilian workforce.&amp;nbsp; Diversity and Inclusion objectives can sometimes be in tension with the rules governing staffing and the provision of benefits under Title V of the United States Code, which OPM is responsible for administering.&amp;nbsp; Accordingly, OGC has always closely reviewed all materials related to diversity and inclusion to ensure that they not only comply with the civil rights laws (for example, our initiatives do not unwittingly result in reverse discrimination) but also that they are consistent with the laws for which OPM is responsible, i.e., Title V.&amp;nbsp; Moreover, OGC is closely involved with revisions to regulations to improve the processes for staffing, performance management, and other personnel processes.&amp;nbsp; Finally, OGC defends the agency or liaises with Justice when diversity and inclusion policies and practices are challenged.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Evidence demonstrates that organizations with a greater percentage of engaged employees outperform those with a lower percentage of engaged employees and engaged employees are demonstrably more productive than their less engaged colleagues.1 OPM’s performance is largely dependent on the performance of its employees. OPM products and services – whether policy analysis or claims processing - are labor intensive. In order to attract and engage a diverse and effective OPM Workforce, we must invest in our most valuable resource – our employees. It is critical we make these investments in our people in order to achieve our mission.
