Indicators:


	
	Reduction in homeless Veterans living on the streets, experiencing homelessness to zero (as measured by the FY 2016 PIT Count).
	
	
	The “Number of Homeless Veterans” on a single night is determined by the PIT Count, which is conducted annually the last week of January each year “The PIT Count reflects the results of the work performed and the fiscal obligation/budget made in the prior fiscal year.”
	
	
	Reduction in total homeless Veterans temporarily living in shelters or transitional housing to 12,500 (as measured by the FY 2016 PIT Count).

&amp;nbsp;
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>VA has taken decisive action toward its goal of ending homelessness among Veterans.&amp;nbsp; The End Veteran Homelessness initiative is intended to prevent Veterans and their families from entering homelessness and to assist those who are homeless in exiting as safely and quickly as possible.&amp;nbsp; VA’s “no wrong door” philosophy will ensure that homeless and at risk for homeless Veterans have timely access to appropriate housing and services.&amp;nbsp; Any door a Veteran comes to - at a medical center, a regional office, or a community organization - will lead to the tools to offer Veteran assistance.&amp;nbsp; Ending homelessness among Veterans will advance the mission of VA by ensuring that all Veterans and their families achieve housing stability.
On a single night in January 2014 during the Point in Time (PIT) Count [1], there were 49,933 homeless Veterans in the US.&amp;nbsp; Effectively ending homelessness among Veterans requires rapid access to permanent housing, health care, employment, benefits, and other supportive services.&amp;nbsp; VA works closely with community partners to meet current and new demands for any Veteran who is experiencing or is at imminent risk of homelessness.&amp;nbsp; Housing First and Rapid Re-housing are two of the many evidence-based approaches VA uses to end homelessness.&amp;nbsp; The Housing First model follows the philosophy of providing permanent housing as quickly as possible to Veterans/individuals experiencing homelessness and then wrapping health care and other supportive services as needed around the Veteran to sustain housing and improve their quality of life.&amp;nbsp; Rapid Re-housing is a set of strategies to help families quickly move out of homelessness and into permanent housing.&amp;nbsp; It typically involves: &amp;nbsp;housing search and landlord mediation assistance, short-term or flexible rental assistance, and transitional case management services.&amp;nbsp; Rapid Re-housing provides crisis intervention services to quickly place an individual or family who is currently homeless into a permanent, sustainable housing situation.




[1] The annual PIT estimates are a snapshot of homelessness.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; They are submitted to HUD each year by communities and account for homeless Veterans in emergency shelters or transitional housing on the night of the PIT count (i.e., sheltered) as well as homeless Veterans who are in places not meant for human habitation such as the streets, abandoned buildings, cars, or encampments (i.e., unsheltered). &amp;nbsp;Communities typically conduct their PIT count during the last week in January when a large share of the homeless population is expected to seek shelter rather than stay outside. &amp;nbsp;Because counting people in shelters is more precise than conducting street counts, the timing of the PIT count is intended to improve the accuracy of the estimates.&amp;nbsp; (Source:&amp;nbsp; Veteran Homelessness:&amp;nbsp; A Supplemental Report to the FY 2010 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress).

	PIT Count.&amp;nbsp; The PIT Count is undertaken in late January each year across the US to enumerate homeless persons, including homeless Veterans.&amp;nbsp; This significant undertaking is led by HUD’s 414 local Continuums of Care (CoCs), which are planning bodies responsible for coordinating all homelessness services in a geographic area.&amp;nbsp; The PIT Count included unsheltered (those living on the street or in another place not meant for human habitation) and sheltered (those living in emergency shelters and transitional housing) individuals on a single night in January 2015.&amp;nbsp;HUD released the results of the 2015 PIT Count of homelessness across the country.&amp;nbsp; On a single night in January 2015, during the PIT Count, there were 47,725 homeless Veterans in the US.&amp;nbsp; These results show that overall Veteran homelessness has decreased by 36 percent since 2010, and unsheltered homelessness has decreased by nearly 50 percent, resulting in tens of thousands fewer Veterans on the streets and without a place to stay.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; VA is serving more Veterans than ever before with specialized homelessness or at-risk services.&amp;nbsp;
	Interagency Work Plan.&amp;nbsp; VA, USICH, HUD and other federal partners will continue to make progress toward the Interagency Work Plan and build a foundation of ongoing work together in the shared goal to end homelessness among Veterans by the end of FY 2015.&amp;nbsp;
	Moves to Permanent Housing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; VA significantly surpassed its annual goal of 49,000.&amp;nbsp; At the end of FY 2015, 64,902 Veterans were placed in permanent housing, including moves into the HUD-VA Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) program and moves from VA residential and Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) programs into permanent housing.&amp;nbsp;
	HUD-VASH.&amp;nbsp; At the end of FY 2015, the total number of HUD-VASH vouchers allocated by HUD was 78,133.&amp;nbsp; Of these vouchers, 71,155 HUD-VASH vouchers were in use, with 63,039 Veterans housed, and 8,116 in the process of obtaining permanent supportive housing.
	Grant and Per Diem (GPD) Program.&amp;nbsp; At the end of FY 2015, 15,507 Veterans were discharged to permanent housing and 43,971 Veterans received services.&amp;nbsp; VA exceeded its target of 65 percent.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; At the end of FY 2015, 70 percent of Veterans discharged from VA funded residential treatment programs–Grant and Per Diem (GPD) or Domiciliary Care for Homeless Veterans (DCHV) discharged to permanent housing.
	Unsheltered Status within 30 Days of Engagement.&amp;nbsp; VA exceeded its target of 80 percent.&amp;nbsp; At the end of FY 2015, 87 percent of unsheltered Veterans moved out of unsheltered status within 30 days of engagement.&amp;nbsp; VA has made it a top priority to quickly move Veterans from unsheltered situations to safe housing, either in transitional or permanent settings.&amp;nbsp; A number of factors have contributed to the success of this metric, including utilization of Housing First and Rapid Re-housing models to move Veterans from unsheltered situations to safe housing and continued strong partnerships with community partners to assist with identification and engagement of unsheltered Veterans.
	SSVF Renewal Funding.&amp;nbsp; On September 14, 2015, VA announced approximately $300 million in SSVF renewal funding to 286 non-profit organizations and consumer cooperatives in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.
	Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) Program.&amp;nbsp; At the end of FY 2015, SSVF assisted more than 156,800 individuals:
	
		Over 98,600 Veterans were assisted.
		Nearly 34,500 children were assisted in nearly 18,200 households with children.
		Of the Veterans assisted, over 13,800 or roughly 14 percent were female.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Military service provides Servicemembers with tremendous skills, experience, and honor, but may also result in equally significant sacrifices and challenges. VA will work to ensure Veterans are empowered, independent, self-sustaining, and well equipped for civilian life.
Each Veteran is unique, yet shaped by: their generation; the conditions of their military service, including any war or conflict in which they served; their gender; their ethnicity; and their support system of faith, family, friends, and caregivers. Each has different needs and expectations, which may change many times between the time they take their induction oath and when the last benefit is received by their survivors.
VA will both directly, and in collaboration with its partners, deliver benefits and services in an integrated, client-centered portfolio that is personalized to meet each Veteran’s needs and situation. Success will be measured in terms relevant to individual Veteran outcomes from VA benefits and services.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>VA is not the sole provider of benefits, services, and resources to Veterans and eligible beneficiaries. We will improve our ability to partner and work with those who provide benefits, services, and resources to our clients through improved collaboration, business practices, and outreach. We will ensure that the necessary benefits, services, and resources are accessible regardless of who provides them.
VA recognizes the importance of, and embraces, the opportunities to work with other Federal agencies, state and local governments, tribal organizations, Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs), Military Service Organizations (MSOs), labor unions, nonprofits, and private industry to better serve Veterans and eligible beneficiaries. DoD and VA, for example, are intimately joined, and VA will build on this relationship to communicate with Servicemembers from the moment they enter into service.

</objective_statement><objective_overview>Summary:
Numerous programs provide a broad spectrum of benefits and support services that assist Veterans and eligible beneficiaries. To enable Veterans and eligible beneficiaries to choose the best benefits and services for their needs, VA will improve coordination between our programs, leverage supportive interactions between programs, and reduce overlap across programs. Success will be measured by the differences made in the lives of the Veterans we serve, including decreasing Veteran unemployment, decreasing home foreclosures, decreasing homelessness, reducing processing times for disability compensation claims, increasing preventive care and healthy lifestyle changes, and increasing access to and utilization of virtual care modalities.
Strategies:
VA will eliminate Veteran homelessness by the end of FY 2015. VA, in collaboration with its Federal partners, will continue to provide rehabilitation services for homeless and at-risk Veterans, including employment assistance, access to permanent and transitional housing, and other supportive services. As the number of homeless Veterans continues to decline, the focus will shift from rescue to prevention.
VA will improve Veteran career readiness to reduce Veteran unemployment. We will synchronize and align Veteran employment programs managed by VA, and improve coordination across the various Federal Veteran employment initiatives. We will increase support to our Veterans with disabilities and those who are GI Bill eligible through programs offering educational and vocational counseling. VA will increase support to Veteran entrepreneurs through public-private partnerships to provide capacity building and by providing access to Federal contracting opportunities.
 
VA will provide Veterans and eligible beneficiaries with personalized, proactive, patient-driven health care to optimize health and well-being, while providing state-of-the-art disease management. VA’s Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACT) will ensure patient engagement in self-care, preventive services, primary care, and mental health services. PACT is a partnership between the Veteran and the health care team with an emphasis on prevention, health promotion, and self-management. PACTs use a team-based approach, with various members of the team stepping in at different points in time to provide needed care. We will expand and refine, in coordination with DoD, research into the long-term consequences of TBI and PTSD. VA will increasingly seek to understand underlying health, injury and disorder mechanisms to create evidence-based diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation methods for Veterans and eligible beneficiaries with support from their families.

</objective_statement><objective_overview>Summary:
While VA is not the sole provider of benefits, services, and resources to Veterans and eligible beneficiaries, we hold ourselves accountable for each Veteran’s success, no matter who provides assistance. To provide Veterans and eligible beneficiaries an integrated, coordinated, personalized portfolio of benefits and services efficiently and effectively, we must improve our communication, coordination, and relationships with our partners in other Federal agencies; state, tribal, and local governments; VSOs; MSOs; academic affiliates; unions; nonprofits; and private industry. We must develop a partnership culture that entails trust, transparency, mutual benefit, responsibility, productivity, and accountability. Increased public-private partnership opportunities empower staff with effective tools and resources for collaborations, and allow for building open innovation platforms.
Strategies:
VA will leverage responsible and productive partnership opportunities that can supplement VA services and help fill urgent or emerging gaps in services. We will pursue opportunities for partnering with organizations that can best provide what we cannot or should not.
VA will establish a partnership award program to acknowledge and recognize successful partnerships in various organizational and service categories.
VA will foster stronger collaboration and information exchange with across the spectrum of care, benefits and services providers.
