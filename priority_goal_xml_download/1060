&amp;nbsp;
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>By September 30, 2015, GSA will save $255 million ($111 million during FY 2014 and $144 million during FY 2015) through the use of Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI). Federal agencies purchase over $500B of goods and services annually. A key vehicle used by GSA, and other top purchasing federal government agencies, to promote cost savings, improved management visibility and adoption of best practices, has been the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative. Established in 2005, FSSI is designed to improve government management of commonly purchased goods and services. FSSI provides customers with significant savings, decreases administrative redundancy, and improves business intelligence while meeting or exceeding small business and sustainability goals.

</APG_Overview><Goal_Leaders><Goal_Leader><goal_leader_name>Tom Sharpe</goal_leader_name><goal_leader_title>Commissioner</goal_leader_title><goal_leader_org>Federal Acquisition Service</goal_leader_org></Goal_Leader></Goal_Leaders><next_steps></next_steps><progress_update>In the first year of the APG, GSA achieved 90% of its costs savings goal by reaching $100M of the $111M target. &amp;nbsp;The third generation of the Office Supplies solution (OS3) was awarded in August 2014. &amp;nbsp;A coverage lapse between OS2 and OS3, due to protest, and the cancellation of a large desktop solicitation, which was expected to contribute $12.2M in savings in FY 2014, impacted the overall savings total. &amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

The Maintenance, Repair and Operations (MRO), Domestic Delivery Services (DDS), Print Management, and the Telecommunications Expense Management Services (TEMS) FSSI solutions all exceeded their savings projections for the fiscal year. &amp;nbsp;The TEMS solution contract expired in the third quarter of FY 2014 and as a result is no longer available. The Wireless solution nearly achieved its annual savings target in FY 2014 as well.

&amp;nbsp;

In the second year of the APG, GSA achieved approximately $129M of its $144M savings target. &amp;nbsp;The difference between the FY 2015 target and actual is partially attributed to the residual effects of the OS3 protest, which grounded the solution until late in the first quarter. As a result, the OS3 solution finished short of its savings projection (~$8M) in FY 2015. &amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

During FY 2015, the Domestic Delivery Services (DDS) solution experienced a lower savings rates due to a dual award environment of the solution and a period of performance that was reduced from 5 to 3 years. &amp;nbsp;However, an influx in business volume helped to offset the reduced savings rates and DDS finished the year only slightly behind its target savings (~$8M) . &amp;nbsp;Domestic Delivery Services Third Generation (DDS3) continued with its successful efforts to alter agency buying behavior to increase ground shipments whenever possible.

&amp;nbsp;

FY 2015 saw the introduction of the Janitorial and Sanitation Supplies FSSI solution and a full scale roll-out of the Maintenance, Repair &amp;amp; Operations Supplies solution, which initially debuted late in the fourth quarter of FY 2014. &amp;nbsp;The addition of these two solutions contributed nearly $15M in savings throughout FY 2015. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Other success stories from FY 2015 include the Print Management and Wireless solutions, both of which nearly tripled their savings projections.


FSSI solutions will continue to be an important tool in FY 2016 and beyond to strategically source goods and services generating savings for the Government. &amp;nbsp;In addition to leveraging FSSI FAS’ implementation of Category Management will more broadly support agencies in buying the goods and services through the best solution possible. &amp;nbsp;FSSI solutions are complementary to the Category Management effort and will potentially help frame sourcing strategies moving forward.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>GSA will strengthen federal capabilities to leverage the purchasing power of the government to offer the most cost-effective solutions. Two areas of focus will be improving federal utilization of space and increasing savings through strategic sourcing. GSA will continue to promote cost savings through the sustainable usage of space, travel, fleet, technology and resources. GSA will also continue to test new technologies, workplaces, and other solutions, and share the best practices with other agencies to generate savings.

</objective_statement><objective_overview>GSA will effectively leverage existing, and develop new, federal strategic sourcing initiatives to provide competitively priced solutions to drive savings in technology, real property and other acquisitions throughout the federal government. Through these solutions, GSA will be able to leverage governmentwide business volume for better pricing, and standardize contracting terms and conditions in order to reduce the cost of purchasing across government.
               
Strategies: 
Continue to assess government purchasing and supply markets to develop federal strategic sourcing initiatives that provide our customers with services and equipment, at an excellent value, from suitable suppliers using standard solution pricing menus.
Use standard solutions and pricing with qualified suppliers to make it easier for agencies to meet their acquisition needs with minimal administrative demands, and, in turn, allow agencies to focus their time and resources towards their core mission-critical operations.
Promote the use of strategic sourcing solutions by our customers and work with our federal partners and industry to develop solutions for a broader array of products and services.
Reduce the operating costs for providing supplies to customers, which in turn will lead to customer savings.
Continue to use solutions such as Smartbuy, Networx Services and Reverse Auctions to provide customers with significant savings for information technology and telecommunications services and equipment.
Continue to develop and refine real estate market analysis tools and leasing processes to offer our customers leased workspace, when needed, at an excellent value.
