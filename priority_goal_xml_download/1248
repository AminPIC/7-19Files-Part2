In addition to delivering science and technology development hardware, crew supplies, and vehicle spares to the ISS, the resupply missions also served as an opportunity for the astronauts aboard the station to return research investigation samples to the Earth for analysis. These capabilities will ensure a robust national capability to deliver critical science research to and from orbit, allowing us to maximize the potential of the ISS, deliver critical benefits to our Nation and the world, and maintain American leadership in space.

The announcement by the Obama Administration to support the extension of the orbiting laboratory to at least 2024 provides NASA with an additional decade to help transition low Earth orbit from exclusive to accessible, and offers scientists and engineers the time they need to ensure the future of exploration, scientific discoveries, and economic development. The ability to extend our window of discovery with the ISS through at least 2024 presents important new opportunities to develop the tools we need for future missions to deep space, while reaping large benefits for humanity. Expanding the timeframe for testing essential technologies and hardware related to long-duration journeys, such as to an asteroid or Mars, is the first step in exploration.

During FY 2014, NASA made progress towards achieving this agency priority goal, broadening ISS utilization to capitalize on its external unpressurized capabilities, and paving the way for NASA’s first use of the station as a 24/7 Earth-observing and technology demonstration platform:


	On January 7, 2014, Orbital Sciences Corporation’s Orbital-1 launched with six CubeSats (i.e., miniaturized satellites for space research) and science resupply.
	On April 18, 2014, Space Exploration Technologies Corporation’s (SpaceX) SpaceX-3 launched with science resupply and two unpressurized payloads, the High Definition Earth Viewing (HDEV) camera and the Optical PAyload for Lasercomm Science (OPALS) laser communications system.
	On July 12, 2014, Orbital-2 launched with more CubeSats and science resupply.
	On July 29, 2014, the European Space Agency’s Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV5) launched with science resupply and two new facilities, a new handrail exposure facility and an electromagnetic levitator.
	On September 22, 2014, SpaceX-4 launched with the ISS-Rapid Scatterometer (RapidScat) designed to measure near-surface ocean wind speed and direction; new Rodent Research Hardware to study the effects of bone and muscle loss in in space; and a three-dimensional (3-D) printer, which is the first step towards establishing an on-demand machine shop in space.
	With the launch of the RapidScat unpressurized payload on SpaceX-4, the ISS achieved 65 percent occupancy, exceeding the 60 percent occupancy baseline from FY 2013.


During FY 2015, NASA continued to support a robust research and development program, as well as increased the facility occupancy by adding new science hardware on orbit. NASA began a one-year US-Russian joint human health and performance research project with the launch of Astronaut Scott Kelly and Cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko to the ISS on March 27, 2015. Kelly and Kornienko will stay aboard the ISS for one year, the longest space mission ever assigned to a NASA astronaut, to examine the effects of long-term spaceflight on human physiology. While Kelly is on board the space station, his identical twin brother, retired NASA astronaut Mark Kelly, will participate in the study on Earth, allowing NASA to better isolate the deleterious effects of spaceflight on the human body, and to aid in the development of countermeasures for these effects. This research will be invaluable to the preparation for future long-duration spaceflight missions&amp;nbsp;to study the effects of long duration space missions on the human body.

The ISS also continued to make progress toward achieving the agency priority goal by launching new external unpressurized science instruments:


	On October 28, 2014, Orbital-3 launched, but failed to reach orbit, resulting in a loss of all cargo onboard.
	On January 10, 2015, SpaceX-5 launched with science resupply; the Cloud-Aerosol Transport System (CATS), designed to study the atmospheric constituents that impact the Earth’s climate; and an IMAX camera to film ISS-based video designed to showcase the ISS as a research and technology platform.
	On April 14, 2015, SpaceX-6 launched with science resupply and the second Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS) Rodent Research investigation.
	On June 28, 2015 SpaceX-7 launched, but failed to reach orbit, resulting in a loss of all cargo onboard.
	On August 19, 2015, Japan’s H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV5) launched with science resupply and the CALorimetric Electron Telescope (CALET), designed to search for dark matter and measure high energy particles and cosmic rays.
	SpaceX-8 with a new external payload was targeted for September 2015, but was delayed until 2016 because of the SpaceX-7 incident investigation.


With the loss of SpaceX-7 and delay of SpaceX-8 into FY&amp;nbsp;2016, the ISS was unable to reach the target of 70&amp;nbsp;percent occupancy, and instead ended FY 2015 with 67&amp;nbsp;percent occupancy. For its FY 2016-17 agency priority goal, NASA has set a target to increase the occupancy of the ISS’s internal and external research facilities to 75 percent.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Expanding the frontiers of knowledge, capability, and opportunity in space is an enduring and core goal for NASA. In the past decade alone, we increased our knowledge of the universe as evidenced by the discovery of more than 2,000 planets in other solar systems. Closer to home, we have expanded our exploration capabilities and sent out robotic sentinels to explore our solar system. The Curiosity rover landed more than 225 million kilometers from Earth and is actively exploring Mars. It has already accomplished its major science goal, discovering a location that could have supported microbial life in the past. We are planning to deepen our knowledge of the working of the interior of planetary bodies by placing a highly sensitive seismometer and associated geophysical instruments on the surface of Mars with the InSight mission. In 2020, we will continue our robotic exploration of Mars with a rover largely built upon the successful Curiosity rover and equipped with new, advanced instruments for in situ studies. It will prepare a scientifically selected cache of Mars samples that may be returned to Earth in the future for detailed analysis seeking possible signs of ancient life.
We are undertaking the detailed examination of near-Earth asteroids to determine what they can tell us about the early solar system, and whether any of these objects pose a threat to Earth. We are expanding our Near Earth Object Observation program, to find candidates for the proposed asteroid mission, and to catalogue asteroids larger than 140 meters across. Specifically, NASA will seek to increase the number of asteroid observations by the amateur astronomer community as a part of the Asteroid Grand Challenge. In 2016, we will launch the OSIRIS-REx mission to robotically approach and return a sample from a carbonaceous asteroid. This will aid in our investigation of planet formation and the origin of life in our solar system, as well as our understanding of asteroids that could impact Earth.
The missions we pursue under this goal help address national challenges and are allowing us to take advantage of unique opportunities to bring benefits to the Nation. For example:

• We are moving forward with critical research and technology demonstrations on the ISS.

Great advances in understanding human health have come from research on the ISS, which
can help prepare us for long-duration space travel, as well as improve the quality of life for aging populations on Earth.

• We are contributing to healthy, cutting-edge manufacturing and aerospace sectors.

For SLS, we are using 3D manufacturing technology to print custom parts for the system, marking a revolution in manufacturing.

• We are enabling a robust commercial space industry.

We are leveraging our public-private partnerships to lower launch costs and create more opportunities for commercial space flight.

• We are adding to the scientific understanding that may be needed to protect Earth.

Our proposed asteroid initiative, comprised of both a bold new mission to an asteroid and a global grand challenge to find all asteroid threats to human populations, will help identify the threats posed by some asteroids as well as teach us how to possibly avoid future impacts.

• We are moving outward, beyond low Earth orbit, into the broader solar system.

We are developing SLS and the Orion to carry astronauts farther into space than humans have ever been.

</objective_statement><objective_overview>NASA’s contribution to society starts with scientific and technological achievement, but extends much further. We are using our resources to spur exploration as well as the new and robust commercial space market. The continued operation of the ISS is critical to achieving NASA’s and the Nation’s goals in science, technology, and human spaceflight. The ISS is the world’s only orbiting, microgravity research and development (R&amp;amp;D) laboratory where researchers may perform multidisciplinary research and technology development to prepare for our exploration of the solar system. Results of research projects will continue to yield benefits in areas such as human health, telemedicine, physical science, Earth observations, space science, and education programs that inspire future scientists, engineers, and space explorers. The Center for Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS), is the sole manager of the ISS National Laboratory, which is a portion of the ISS, and is working to maximize use of the ISS for research in space. The Administration’s decision to extend ISS operations until at least 2024 will allow us to maximize its potential and maintain American leadership in space.
The ISS is proving to be a catalyst for the growing commercial space enterprise, as well as a critical springboard for our future space exploration goals. NASA is buying hundreds of millions of dollars of cargo flights from new commercial launch services providers. With the collaboration of five space agencies, 15 nations, and private companies, the ISS is a model for cooperation on future human space exploration missions beyond low Earth orbit.
