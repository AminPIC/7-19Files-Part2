</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>NASA is developing the nation’s first human deep-space exploration capability in the form of the Space Launch System (SLS) and the Orion crew vehicle. With the supporting Exploration Ground Systems (EGS), the SLS and Orion will carry humans farther into space than ever before, and are essential for exploration of deep space, including future human exploration of Mars. Human space exploration inspires the nation to seek knowledge through scientific discovery, advancing our understanding of the universe. As the foundation of the human exploration endeavor which will drive the Space Economy, these programs are fueling the creation of new industries, job growth, and the demand for a highly skilled workforce. NASA’s human exploration portfolio will be the initial catalyst for a better life on Earth, advancing American leadership in space, and creating a path for peace, diplomacy, and global cooperation.


NASA’s first flight of the SLS with the Orion crew vehicle, the EM-1, is currently targeted for launch in FY 2018. The EM-1 is the first flight of an uncrewed mission that will orbit the Moon and return safely to Earth. The EM-1 flight will exercise multiple systems and technical approaches in preparation for a crewed mission. To successfully achieve the goal of launching EM-1 in FY 2018, the SLS launch vehicle, Orion spacecraft and EGS programs will complete several significant design reviews as well as test flight and ground hardware and software prior to launch. The successful completion of these milestones, in conjunction with the final assembly and test of the launch vehicle and spacecraft hardware at the Kennedy Space Center launch site, will enable the successful launch of the EM-1 flight. By the end of FY 2015, all three programs-SLS, Orion and EGS-will have completed their individual Critical Design Reviews (CDRs), ensuring the whole exploration system progresses toward the EM-1 flight in FY 2018.

The SLS program CDR is the culmination of the various SLS elements’ final design reviews and will be held by the end of FY 2015. The program CDR will assess the ability of the overall launch vehicle design to meet the mission requirements with acceptable risk and appropriate margins within the defined cost, schedule and technical constraints.

Similar to the SLS, the Orion program CDR will be the culmination of several more detailed reviews. Critical flight data from the Exploration Flight Test-1 mission, the first Orion test flight to be launched in 2014, will provide information to finalize the design of the Orion spacecraft. Additionally, one of the final design reviews will focus on the Service Module, which will be developed for NASA by the European Space Agency (ESA). NASA is leveraging its strong international partnership with ESA-established in the development of the International Space Station (ISS). ESA will provide the European Service Module, a critical Orion element, in support of the first integrated test flight on the SLS launch vehicle, EM-1 in FY 2018. The Orion program CDR will assess the ability of the overall spacecraft design to meet the mission requirements with acceptable risk and appropriate margins within the defined cost, schedule and technical constraints.

The Exploration Ground Systems program CDR will be the culmination of several system-level final design reviews. For example, the mobile launcher (ML), which will provide all of the necessary ground system connections and services to the SLS launch vehicle and Orion spacecraft, will complete structural modifications by the end of this goal. After the structural modifications are complete, additional modifications of the ML will continue through FY 2017. The EGS program CDR will assess the ability of the overall ground systems designs in meeting the mission requirements with acceptable risk and appropriate margins within the defined cost, schedule and technical constraints.

Orion Program

A major milestone for the Orion Program was the successful flight of Exploration Flight Test 1 (EFT-1) in December 2014. EFT-1 was designed to take the Crew Module further from Earth than any human-rated spacecraft has traveled since Apollo, testing the capsule’s primary reentry systems, including the heat shield and parachute systems, at conditions far exceeding those experienced during return from low Earth orbit. EFT-1 was fitted with hundreds of sensors to provide information on loads, acceleration, acoustics, vibration, and other factors that affect vehicle performance and crew survival. The mission also allowed the Orion and Ground Systems Development and Operations teams to experience the process of working together throughout Assembly, Test, and Launch Operations, and for the Mission Control teams at the Kennedy Space Center and Johnson Space Center to test procedures and hand-offs. The results of EFT-1 produced specific improvements in the design and manufacturing process for both the heat shield and pressure vessel, as well as enhancements in control of the parachute motion upon reentry, and the evaluation of improvements to the Crew Module Uprighting System.

Orion also made major progress on flight hardware and test capabilities. In FY 2015, the Orion Program began machining the Exploration Mission 1 (EM-1) Crew Module primary structure or Pressure Vessel - the living space within Orion. Machining of the final EM-1 flight component was completed in the first quarter of FY 2016. Ahead of the machining and welding of each EM-1 flight part, a pathfinder version was machined and then welded to test the design and procedures. All pathfinder and flight Pressure Vessel parts have been delivered to Michoud Assembly Facility, pathfinder article welds are nearly complete, and the first flight weld was completed in the first quarter of FY 2016. A major test facility, the Integrated Test Laboratory, was completed and opened in Denver in 4th quarter FY 2015. The Integrated Test Laboratory will be a critical facility not only for Orion, but for the Space Launch System.

In the 4th quarter of FY 2015, Orion passed its Key Decision Point C (KDP-C) review. The data gained from EFT-1 was critical to maturing the preliminary design, allowing the team to advance to its Critical Design Review (CDR) Board, which was completed October 21, 2015.

Space Launch System (SLS) Program

The SLS Program continues to make substantial and sustained progress toward first flight on EM-1. Two major propulsion test milestones were accomplished during the reporting period. In January 2015, SLS conducted a test of the RS-25 core stage engine, the first in a series of seven development tests in FY 2015 and the first test of an RS-25 since the Space Shuttle program completed engine testing in 2010. In March 2015, SLS also successfully conducted the first of two planned booster qualification motor test firings, QM-1.

The SLS Program also made progress on the production capability of the 217-foot-tall core stage flight articles. NASA’s SLS Program began delivery and assembly of the Vertical Assembly Center (VAC) welding tool at the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, Louisiana, in the second quarter of FY 2014. The VAC was officially activated in September 2014, and NASA began welding of the pathfinder barrel sections in the last quarter of FY 2014. In January 2015, a tool alignment problem was discovered, but is on track for remediation; the new date for VAC tool acceptance is now in the first quarter of FY 2016. The VAC is the largest welding tool of its kind in the world and will enable assembly of the SLS Core Stage barrel sections using advanced friction stir welding.

SLS has successfully met major design review milestones with successful completion of element CDRs for SLS elements, including the Core Stage (July 2014), Booster (August 2014), Engines (December 2014), and Spacecraft Payload Integration and Evolution CDR-1 (April 2015), and culminating with the successful completion of the SLS program-level CDR in July 2015. NASA confidence in the SLS Program was affirmed when the program cleared the Agency’s KDP-C milestone in August 2014, marking the transition from development into implementation and setting the program’s baseline cost and schedule commitments.

Exploration Ground Systems (EGS) Program

For the EGS Program, modernization and compatibility efforts continued in FY 2015 to support the EM-1 launch. EGS completed major infrastructure enhancements to prepare launch pad 39B for the EM-1 mission and future flights. Enhancements such as the flame trench, flame deflector, ignition overpressure, and sound suppression system, will safely channel the extraordinary energy released by the rocket away from critical systems. To provide ground crew access to the launch vehicle and Orion while on the mobile launcher, upgrades continue to the aging ground support equipment and umbilical outfitting on the upper stage, core stage, and crew access arm. NASA completed the design for the new adjustable high-bay access in the Vehicle Assembly Building and awarded a construction contract.

As noted earlier, EGS supported Orion EFT-1 landing and recovery operations in FY 2015. EFT-1 completed the underway recovery tests of the EFT-1 mission Crew Module, while ongoing landing recovery planning and design continue in support of EM-1. End-to end spaceport command and control system applications and displays were worked along with transmission, imagery, and voice communication. Integrated verification and validation activity began, in order to ensure mission success and seamless integration and launch site processing during EM-1.

The EGS Program entered the implementation phase of its lifecycle, where final designs and initial fabrication take place. In January 2014, EGS successfully completed its Preliminary Design Review, and in May 2014, KDP-C, which confirmed the project had achieved stable design requirements and was authorized to proceed to the next level of developmental readiness.

The EGS Program was scheduled to complete its CDR to evaluate the integrity of the ground system design, and its ability to meet mission requirements within available resources and with appropriate margins and acceptable risk. This review will determine if the design is appropriately mature to continue to the final design and fabrication phase. As a result of efforts to synchronize the three programs, the Ground Systems Development and Operations CDR was rescheduled to December 15, 2015. The program is on track to complete the review according to the new direction.

Summary of Progress

While NASA did not fully complete its agency priority goal during FY&amp;nbsp;2015, it made significant progress towards the goal, and is on track to complete it by March&amp;nbsp;2016. NASA completed the SLS CDR on July 22, 2015. The Orion CDR Board, scheduled for late FY&amp;nbsp;2015, was completed in October&amp;nbsp;2015; and the EGS Program CDR is now scheduled for FY 2016. For its FY 2016-17 agency priority goal, NASA will begin integration and testing of the EM-1 Orion Crew Module, including the first power-on of the vehicle; deliver all four EM-1 SLS Core Stage RS-25 engines to the Michoud Assembly Facility in preparation for integration into the Core Stage; and complete construction of EGS Pad B.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Expanding the frontiers of knowledge, capability, and opportunity in space is an enduring and core goal for NASA. In the past decade alone, we increased our knowledge of the universe as evidenced by the discovery of more than 2,000 planets in other solar systems. Closer to home, we have expanded our exploration capabilities and sent out robotic sentinels to explore our solar system. The Curiosity rover landed more than 225 million kilometers from Earth and is actively exploring Mars. It has already accomplished its major science goal, discovering a location that could have supported microbial life in the past. We are planning to deepen our knowledge of the working of the interior of planetary bodies by placing a highly sensitive seismometer and associated geophysical instruments on the surface of Mars with the InSight mission. In 2020, we will continue our robotic exploration of Mars with a rover largely built upon the successful Curiosity rover and equipped with new, advanced instruments for in situ studies. It will prepare a scientifically selected cache of Mars samples that may be returned to Earth in the future for detailed analysis seeking possible signs of ancient life.
We are undertaking the detailed examination of near-Earth asteroids to determine what they can tell us about the early solar system, and whether any of these objects pose a threat to Earth. We are expanding our Near Earth Object Observation program, to find candidates for the proposed asteroid mission, and to catalogue asteroids larger than 140 meters across. Specifically, NASA will seek to increase the number of asteroid observations by the amateur astronomer community as a part of the Asteroid Grand Challenge. In 2016, we will launch the OSIRIS-REx mission to robotically approach and return a sample from a carbonaceous asteroid. This will aid in our investigation of planet formation and the origin of life in our solar system, as well as our understanding of asteroids that could impact Earth.
The missions we pursue under this goal help address national challenges and are allowing us to take advantage of unique opportunities to bring benefits to the Nation. For example:

• We are moving forward with critical research and technology demonstrations on the ISS.

Great advances in understanding human health have come from research on the ISS, which
can help prepare us for long-duration space travel, as well as improve the quality of life for aging populations on Earth.

• We are contributing to healthy, cutting-edge manufacturing and aerospace sectors.

For SLS, we are using 3D manufacturing technology to print custom parts for the system, marking a revolution in manufacturing.

• We are enabling a robust commercial space industry.

We are leveraging our public-private partnerships to lower launch costs and create more opportunities for commercial space flight.

• We are adding to the scientific understanding that may be needed to protect Earth.

Our proposed asteroid initiative, comprised of both a bold new mission to an asteroid and a global grand challenge to find all asteroid threats to human populations, will help identify the threats posed by some asteroids as well as teach us how to possibly avoid future impacts.

• We are moving outward, beyond low Earth orbit, into the broader solar system.

We are developing SLS and the Orion to carry astronauts farther into space than humans have ever been.

</objective_statement><objective_overview>Over the next decades, NASA intends to erase the boundaries to human exploration of space. We want to open new frontiers beyond low Earth orbit to humankind. NASA is expanding human exploration by developing the capability to transport humans to and from deep space, enabling the exploration of other planets and asteroids within our solar system using innovative, advanced technologies.
As a starting point, exploring deep space requires the capability to transport cargo and crew beyond low Earth orbit, or farther than 2,000 kilometers beyond Earth. NASA is developing a new transportation system that includes a crew capsule, a heavy-lift launch vehicle, and supporting ground facilities and systems.
NASA is developing technologies to enable the additional capabilities that will be required the farther away from Earth we travel. These include the capabilities for in-space propulsion, in-space operations, long-duration habitation, and other systems to support humans in hostile environments. Precursor robotics, robotic missions that investigate candidate destinations and provide vital information to prepare for human explorers, will lay the groundwork for humans to achieve new milestones in deep space.
The capability to transport humans to and from deep space will leverage incremental development of exploration capabilities that seed future discoveries and innovation, and eventually lead to creation of a permanent, long-term human space presence in the solar system. Our exploration of deep space will reward us with new knowledge. While new knowledge increases our understanding of our planet, our solar system, our universe, and ourselves, Americans expect tangible benefits and applications that we can use on Earth. If the past is prologue, scientists and entrepreneurs will generate new uses for the knowledge and technology resulting from NASA’s investments in exploration systems, and this in turn will grow the U.S. economy.
