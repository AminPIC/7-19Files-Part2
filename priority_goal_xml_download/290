Over the course of the past two years, the IRS has launched thirteen releases of nine online products addressing some of the highest volume needs that citizens have when they interact with IRS. These digital products enable taxpayers to securely access IRS tools, create payment agreements and make payments online, view tax records, and search for tax assistance.

Treasury will continue this as a FY 2016-2017 APG to advance the progress made during the last two years.&amp;nbsp; Over the coming months, the IRS will finalize a modified, more secure version of eAuthentication in response to the fraudulent infiltration of Get Transcript. IRS is also planning to pilot and release an Online Account that will allow taxpayers to access account balance information, transcripts, and payment tools in a mobile-friendly, integrated experience. The IRS also aims to pilot a Taxpayer Digital Communication (TDC) solution that will allow authenticated users to receive digital notices, interact with secure messages, and transfer digital documents to and from the IRS via a secure communication portal.

The progress that IRS has made in launching these tools, as reflected in this Agency Priority Goal, highlights the work of many people, including IRS employees, strategic partners, and the broader community. The IRS will continue to focus on encouraging more people to choose digital service, enabling them to successfully complete their transactions online, and delivering these services as efficiently and cost-effectively as possible.
