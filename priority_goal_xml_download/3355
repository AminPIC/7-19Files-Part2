By September 30, 2015, FSIS will reduce the total estimated number of foodborne&amp;nbsp;Salmonella&amp;nbsp;illnesses caused by FSIS-regulated products to&amp;nbsp;357,515 illnesses from a 2007-2009 baseline of 413,965 illnesses.

The FY 2015 target aligns with the established FSIS “All-Illness Measure” that seeks an ambitious reduction in&amp;nbsp;Salmonella, E. coli&amp;nbsp;O157:H7, and&amp;nbsp;Listeria monocytogenes (Lm)&amp;nbsp;illnesses concurrent with illness reductions identified in the Department of Health and Human Services Healthy People 2020 Initiative.
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Salmonella&amp;nbsp;is the leading known cause of bacterial foodborne illness and death in the U.S. causing an estimated 1.3 million illnesses, and between 400 and 500 deaths annually.&amp;nbsp; FSIS estimates that, in Q4, FY2013, approximately 393,000&amp;nbsp;Salmonella&amp;nbsp;illnesses were associated with Agency-regulated products.

Preventing&amp;nbsp;Salmonella&amp;nbsp;infections depends on actions taken to reduce contamination of food by the food industry, regulatory agencies, and consumers, as well as actions taken for detecting and responding to outbreaks when they occur. FSIS, a public health regulatory agency within the USDA, is responsible for ensuring that the commercial supply of meat, poultry, and processed egg products moving in interstate commerce or exported to other countries is safe, secure, wholesome, and correctly labeled and packaged.

This Agency Priority Goal (APG) tracks an established FSIS performance measure known as the “All-Illness Measure” that estimates the total number of illnesses from&amp;nbsp;Salmonella,&amp;nbsp;Listeria monocytogenes (Lm), and&amp;nbsp;E. coli&amp;nbsp;O157:H7 from all FSIS-regulated products. FSIS estimates that approximately 33% of all salmonellosis is associated with FSIS regulated products* and that&amp;nbsp;Salmonella&amp;nbsp;comprises approximately 95% of all estimated illnesses in the All-Illness Measure. &amp;nbsp;This corporate performance measure is included in the USDA Strategic Plan and the FSIS Strategic Plan for 2011-2016. FSIS Program Area actions designed to achieve the goal are included in the FSIS Annual Performance Plan.&amp;nbsp; This APG specifically tracks and reports on reductions in&amp;nbsp;Salmonella&amp;nbsp;illnesses.

FSIS will attempt to achieve the ambitious reduction in&amp;nbsp;Salmonella&amp;nbsp;illnesses called for in this APG through the implementation of the 2013 FSIS&amp;nbsp;Strategic&amp;nbsp;Performance Working Group (SPWG) Action Plan for&amp;nbsp;Salmonella, along with existing FSIS activities focused on reducing&amp;nbsp;Salmonella&amp;nbsp;contamination on regulated product.

Additionally, FSIS works closely with other Federal agencies that have a role in protecting the food supply, including both the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); FSIS has worked with these agencies on a Priority Goal to reduce&amp;nbsp;Salmonella&amp;nbsp;Enteritidis illnesses from FDA-regulated shell eggs.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; FSIS also works with sister agencies within USDA, including the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), and USDA’s research agencies such as the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Economic Research Service (ERS), and National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) in protecting the food supply.

This goal relates directly to the USDA Strategic Plan goal 4.3, “Protect Public Health by Ensuring Food is Safe”, to ensure that all of America’s children have access to safe, nutritious, and balanced meals.

*At the time FSIS developed and submitted its Agency Priority Goal, the most recent outbreak data the Agency had to calculate foodborne illness attribution was from 2008-2010 (33% for Salmonella).&amp;nbsp; In the subsequent quarter, FSIS received new outbreak data from the CDC, which allowed the Agency to estimate a new attribution fraction for 2009-2011, which for Salmonella was 31.7%.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

In Q4, FY2015, FSIS did not achieve the Agency’s illness reduction targets set for Salmonella. The target for Q4, FY2015 was 357,515 Salmonella illnesses, and the actual estimated illnesses for Q4 attributable to Salmonella in FSIS-regulated product were 374,671.

Consequently, steps identified in the Strategy section of the APG document and discussed below, are still needed.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;

Salmonella&amp;nbsp;Performance Standard

Progress Update

In Q4, FY2015, FSIS achieved the Agency’s goal for the percent of broiler establishments passing the Agency’s 2011 Salmonella performance standard.&amp;nbsp; In Q4, FY2015, the percentage of broiler establishments passing the performance standard is 95.6%, exceeding the target of 94%. In May, FSIS began continuous sampling, rather than set based sampling, for products subject to Salmonella and Campylobacter testing, including young chicken carcasses.&amp;nbsp; Previously, to determine the percentage of Young Chicken establishments passing the performance standard for this measure, the calculation was limited to establishments with at least two complete sets of 51 samples, and it was based on the two most recent completed sets (excluding any recent samples not part of a completed set), which were normally completed in the last 2 years.&amp;nbsp; Starting with Q4 FY2015, to continue reporting results in the most similar way for this measure and to allow for historical comparison, FSIS will calculate the measure based on the most recent 51 samples from an establishment, collected within the past 2 years.

When reporting Q3 results, FSIS calculated and reported the result of this measure more similar to how FSIS will track industry performance in the future.&amp;nbsp; That result was 94.2%.&amp;nbsp; However, that approach will likely not begin until spring of 2016, pending publication of a Federal Register Notice.&amp;nbsp; Because the current FSIS strategic plan concludes in FY2016, and FSIS will begin reporting on new measures in FY2017, the Agency determined that the best way to report performance for this measure would be to calculate the result as close as possible to what it did in the past under set based sampling.&amp;nbsp; That result for Q3 was 96.2%. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

Milestone Completion:


	All poultry slaughter establishments began their required compliance with sampling requirements for establishment-conducted testing under the Modernization of Poultry Slaughter Inspection final rule.
	Continuous sampling and a moving window approach to Salmonella verification testing began May 1.
	FSIS initiated routine sampling of raw chicken parts for Salmonella in March 2015, and FSIS Notice 50-15 issued in August to clarify instructions for field personnel.
	FSIS initiated the pork exploratory survey on May 1, 2015 with collection of samples from three types of products: comminuted pork, intact cuts, and intact other pork products.&amp;nbsp; FSIS is continuing to collect samples and will analyze data.&amp;nbsp;
	Performed Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) on 694 FSIS isolates (340 Salmonella, 148&amp;nbsp; STECs, 104 Campylobacter and&amp;nbsp; 102 Lm) and uploaded the data to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).
	FSIS developed a draft, automated, quarterly report of Agency sampling data (pathogens, Serotype, PFGE, AMR, residue and industry averages) by product for individual establishments.&amp;nbsp; The report and distribution plan are being cleared internally through the FSIS Enterprise Governance process.
	The Nationwide Beef and Veal Carcass Microbiological Baseline study began on Aug 1, 2014. FSIS and the collection period has been extended six months, until January 31, 2016, in order to obtain the appropriate number of samples for the study. &amp;nbsp;
	An operational measure model prototype was designed to characterize sampling subtyping results, seasonality, and weather factors affecting trends in Salmonella and Campylobacter positive sampling results. Working model currently focuses on Young Chicken carcass aggregate data analysis but may be expanded.
	FSIS continues to analyze for&amp;nbsp;Salmonella&amp;nbsp;all raw beef products collected for STEC testing.&amp;nbsp;
