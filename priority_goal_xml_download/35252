</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Combined with DOT’s fuel efficiency standards, EPA’s vehicle GHG standards enable historic progress to be made in reducing carbon pollution and addressing climate change which threatens the public health and welfare of the American people. These standards will cut GHG emissions by about 6 billion metric tons and reduce U.S. oil consumption by about 12 billion barrels while saving consumers more than $1.7 trillion at the gas pump over the lifetime of the light-duty vehicles for model year 2012-2025. For commercial trucks, the estimated combined standards will reduce CO2 emissions by about 270 million metric tons and save about 530 million barrels of oil over the life of model year 2014 to 2018.

For the passenger vehicle GHG and fuel economy standards, individual consumers will save an estimated $8,000 on fuel over the lifetime (i.e., approximately 200,000 average vehicle miles traveled (VMT)) of a model year (MY) 2025 vehicle. For the heavy-duty truck standards, the average operator of a semi-truck can pay for the technology upgrades in under a year, and have net savings of up to $73,000 over the lifetime of the truck

This FY 2016-2017 APG builds upon the successes of the related FY 2014-2015 and FY 2012-2013 Agency Priority Goals related to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transportation activities. The FY 2012-2013 APG focused on the implementation of the first light-duty vehicle standards (MY 2012-2016) and preparing for the implementation of heavy-duty standards (MY 2014-2018The FY 2014-2015 APG focused on incorporating the light-duty GHG standards for model years 2017-2025 (finalized in August 2012) and transitioning from the voluntary early credit earning phase (i.e., credit banking/trading, off-cycle credits, air-conditioning improvement credits) to full implementation of the 2014-2018 heavy-duty rule.

The focus of the FY 2016-2017 APG will be on manufacturer compliance with the standards, the natural progression as the programs mature. EPA will continue to track issuing certificates and confirmatory testing but will also track new reporting metrics to capture compliance activities.

</next_steps><progress_update>4th Quarter, FY 2016

Light-Duty (LD) Standards

For light-duty standards, EPA does not set targets for number of certificates issued because it is dependent on the number of requests submitted by manufacturers. However, EPA continues to issue light duty certificates in a timely manner and in pace with the numbers of requests received.&amp;nbsp;In Q4 of FY 2016, EPA issued 202 light-duty certificates of conformity, and confirmatory tested 39 manufacturer pre-production certification vehicles to confirm their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions results.

Manufacturer reporting for compliance with EPA’s GHG emission standards for the 2015 model year must be completed and submitted to EPA by March 31. The final model year report that includes GHG credit information must be submitted by May 1. For Q4, 100 percent of manufacturers completed and marked their fleet data final. Ninety-five percent of all manufacturers also submitted complete GHG credit reports by the end of Q4. The manufacturer that has not submitted their credit report is submitting an update for multiple years.

The 2015 Model Year GHG Performance report is scheduled to be published in the Q1 of 2017. The manufacturer performance will be reported in this report. For reference, the 2014 Model Year report was published in Q1 of FY 2016 and is available at https://www.epa.gov/regulations-emissions-vehicles-and-engines/greenhouse-gas-ghg-emission-standards-light-duty-vehicles#2014. Overall industry compliance for model year 2014 was 13 grams/mile better than what is required by the 2014 GHG emissions standard. This marks the third consecutive model year that industry outperformed the standards by a wide margin; industry over-compliance in 2013 was 12 grams/mile and in 2012 was 11 grams/mile better than required. This industry-wide performance means that consumers continue to buy vehicles with lower GHG emissions than required by the EPA standards. Manufacturers continued this level of performance against increasingly stringent standards.

Heavy-Duty (HD) Standards

For heavy-duty standards, EPA does not set targets for number of certificates issued because it is dependent on the number of requests submitted by manufacturers. EPA continues to issue heavy-duty certificates in a timely manner and in pace with the numbers of requests that EPA receives. In Q4 of FY 2016, EPA issued a total of 64 heavy-duty certificates of conformity.

Manufacturer reporting for compliance with EPA’s GHG emission standards for the 2015 model year must be complete and submitted to EPA by September 30. For Q4 of FY 2016, heavy-duty GHG Vehicle 2015 final 90 day reporting status is 96% complete and HD GHG Engine 2015 final 90 day reporting status is 100% complete. Additionally, 96% of HD vehicle manufacturers have submitted their production volume report and 100% of HD engine manufacturers have submitted their production volume report.

Additionally, the 2014 Model Year heavy-duty GHG compliance report has been compiled and is currently under review and pending publication. &amp;nbsp;Based on the manufacturers’ results, all manufacturers are projected to be fully in compliance with the standards. EPA intends to deliver a public report after ensuring that all information is acceptable to release under our confidential business information (CBI) regulations.&amp;nbsp;

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Climate change poses risks to human health, the environment, cultural resources, the economy, and quality of life.[1]  These changes are expected to create further challenges to protecting human health and welfare.  Many effects of a changing climate are already evident and will persist into the future regardless of future levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  For example, average U.S. temperatures are rising, snow and rainfall patterns are shifting, and more extreme climate events—like heavy rainstorms and record high temperatures—are already affecting society, human health, and the environment.  Potential climate change impacts may also make it more difficult to achieve clean air goals.  To better protect human health and the environment, EPA must recognize and consider the challenge a changing climate poses to the environment. 
 
Notwithstanding this challenge, since passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments in 1990, nationwide air quality has improved significantly.[2]  Levels of those pollutants linked to the greatest health impacts continue to decline.  From 2003 to 2011, population-weighted ambient concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone have decreased 26 percent and 16 percent, respectively.  Even with this progress, in 2010 approximately 40 percent of the U.S. population lived in counties with air that did not meet health-based standards for at least one pollutant.  Long-term exposure to elevated levels of certain air pollutants has been associated with increased risk of cancer, premature mortality, and damage to the immune, neurological, reproductive, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems.[3]  Because people spend much of their lives indoors, the quality of indoor air is also a major health concern.  Indoor allergens and irritants play a significant role in making asthma worse and triggering asthma attacks.  The most recent data (2011) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tell us that 26 million Americans have asthma, and in 2010, CDC reports that asthma was the primary diagnosis for nearly 2 million hospital emergency visits.[4]  In 2008, more than half of children and one-third of adults who had an asthma attack missed school or work because of asthma and total costs for Americans from asthma was $56 billion in 2007.[5]   Exposure to indoor radon is responsible for an estimated 21,000 premature lung cancer deaths each year.[6]  Twenty percent of the population spends the day indoors in elementary and secondary schools, where potential problems with leaky roofs and with heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems can trigger a host of health problems, including asthma and allergies.

</objective_statement><objective_overview>EPA’s strategies to address climate change reflect the President’s call to action in his Climate Action Plan (June 2013), which, among other initiatives, tasks EPA with setting carbon dioxide (CO2) standards for power plants and applying the Agency’s authorities and other tools to address hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and methane.  These strategies support the President's goal to reduce GHG emissions by 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020.[1]  EPA and its partners are developing and implementing approaches to reduce GHG emissions domestically and internationally through cost-effective, voluntary programs while pursuing additional regulatory actions as needed.  Our efforts address the following areas:
 
Mobile Sources
 
Implementing three sets of GHG standards for vehicles and trucks, including:  two sets of GHG standards for light-duty cars and trucks (model years 2012-2016 and 2017-2025); and the first set of standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks and buses (model years 2014-2018).  These emission standards, finalized jointly with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) fuel economy standards, will result in substantial reductions in new vehicle GHG emissions from model years 2012 through 2025.  (Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks is an FY 2014-2015 Agency Priority Goal.[2])
Carrying out the next phase of the GHG vehicle emission standards.  Consistent with the President’s Climate Action Plan, the Agency plans to propose in March 2015 a second phase of fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emission standards for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles for model years 2018 and beyond, and plans to finalize the standards in March 2016.  This second phase of regulations will build upon the success of the first phase and offer further opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and decrease transportation fuel consumption, and is expected to benefit consumers and business by reducing the cost of transporting goods while spurring job growth and innovation in the clean energy technology sector.
Assessing GHG control options for non-road sources, including evaluating whether and when to commence work on standards setting for GHG emissions from a wide range of non-road equipment, locomotives, marine vessels and aircraft, and transportation fuels.
Stationary Sources
Using authority under Section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act, EPA  issued a new proposal on September 20, 2013 for GHG performance standards for new power plants and will subsequently finalize that rule after consideration of public comment as appropriate.  Using authority under Sections 111(b) and 111(d) of the Act, EPA will issue proposed GHG standards, regulations, or guidelines, as appropriate, for modified, reconstructed, and existing power plants by June 1, 2014, and finalize these standards, regulations, or guidelines by June 1, 2015.
Collecting and publishing high-quality GHG emissions data from large direct emitters and suppliers of GHGs through the greenhouse gas reporting program to inform the public and support sound, data-driven, policy decisions on climate change.
Implementing permitting requirements for facilities that emit large amounts of GHGs to encourage design and construction of more sustainable, efficient, and advanced processes that will contribute to a clean energy economy.
Applying the Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) program to promote the use of low global warming potential HFCs and similar chemicals.
 
International and Other Efforts
Implementing proven voluntary programs that maximize GHG reductions through the greater use of technologies, products, and practices that promote energy efficiency, and renewables programs and policies that benefit the environment and human health.
Identifying and assessing substitute chemical and ozone-depleting substances and processes for their global warming potential.
Collaborating with countries and other international partners to reduce methane emissions and deliver clean energy to markets around the world through the Global Methane Initiative.
Collaborating with international partners to reduce short-lived climate pollutants, including methane, black carbon, and hydrofluorocarbons, through the Climate and Clean Air Coalition.
Educating the public about a changing climate and actions people can take to reduce GHG emissions.
Collaborating with state, local, and tribal governments on regulatory and policy initiatives, technical assistance, and voluntary programs related to climate change mitigation and adaptation.
 
Adaptation
Much of EPA’s work is sensitive to weather and climate.  Consequently, the various actions EPA takes to meet its obligations and achieve its goals, including promulgating regulations and implementing programs, take these variables into consideration.  For example, potential increases in ground-level ozone due to a changing climate could make attainment or maintenance of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) more challenging.  Similarly, attaining water quality standards will become more difficult as water temperatures increase in response to climate change.
EPA must adapt and plan for future changes in climate to continue fulfilling its statutory, regulatory, and programmatic requirements.  The Agency will implement its Climate Change Adaptation Plan, and consider where it is appropriate to integrate and mainstream considerations of a changing climate into the full range of its programs to ensure they are effective under future climatic conditions.  EPA will work with state, tribal, and local partners to enhance their capacity to adapt to a changing climate.  Each of the EPA national programs and ten regional offices will implement new climate adaptation implementation plans to carry out the work called for in the Agency’s Climate Change Adaptation Plan.  EPA will also continue to collaborate with the U.S. Global Change Research Program and the Council on Climate Change Preparedness and Resilience to support the development and implementation of climate change adaptation plans by all federal agencies.[3]
Adaptation initiatives undertaken by EPA national programs and regional offices will carry out key elements of the President’s Climate Action Plan (June 2013) and aim to increase the resilience of communities and ecosystems to climate change by increasing their ability to anticipate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from the impacts of a changing climate.  EPA is encouraging and supporting smarter, more resilient investments by integrating considerations of climate change impacts and adaptive measures into major grant, loan, contract, and technical assistance programs, consistent with existing authorities.  For example, EPA is integrating climate adaptation criteria into the Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Funds and grants for brownfields cleanup.  EPA is also partnering with states, tribes, and urban and rural communities to integrate climate change data, models, information, and other decision-support tools into their planning processes in ways that empower them to anticipate, prepare for, and adapt to a changing climate.  As an example, EPA developed a stormwater calculator that will enable users to evaluate the effectiveness of alternative strategies for limiting stormwater runoff that can overwhelm sewer systems and spill into rivers and streams, and to identify strategies that ensure the systems are effective under future climatic conditions.
 
External Factors and Emerging Issues
External influences on EPA’s efforts to improve air quality and address climate change issues include the evolution of state and local transportation and energy-related policies and the impacts of a changing climate, such as changes in rainfall amount and intensity, shifting weather and seasonal patterns, and increases in flood plain elevations and sea levels.  Some of these external influences present significant challenges to the EPA’s work, whereas others, such as the growth of alternative energy sources and increased investments in energy efficiency, can improve local air quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

FY 2014-2015 Agency Priority Goal:  Reduce greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles and trucks: Through September 30, 2015, EPA in coordination with Department of Transportation’s fuel economy standards program will be implementing vehicle and truck greenhouse gas (GHG) standards that are projected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 billion metric tons and reduce oil consumption by about 12 billion barrels over the lifetime of the affected vehicles and trucks.
The U.S. Global Change Research Program coordinates and integrates federal research on changes in the global environment and the implications of these changes for society, as mandated in the Global Change Research Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-606) (http://www.globalchange.gov/about/global-change-research-act.html).  In 2009, the White House Council on Environmental Quality, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration initiated the Interagency Climate Change Adaptation Task Force.  When the President signed Executive Order 13514, Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic Performance, in October 2009, he called on the Task Force to develop federal recommendations for adapting to climate change impacts both domestically and internationally.  Executive Order 13514 is available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/President-Obama-signs-an-Executive-Order-Focused-on-Federal-Leadership-in-Environmental-Energy-and-Economic-Performance.
