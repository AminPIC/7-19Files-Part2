</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>OLEM tracks over 500,000 sites, representing about 23 million acres of land.&amp;nbsp; EPA’s Superfund, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) corrective action (CA), leaking underground stor¬age tank (LUST), and Brownfields cleanup programs reduce risks to human health and the envi¬ronment by assessing and cleaning up contaminated sites to enhance the livability and economic vitality of neighborhoods.&amp;nbsp; Challenging and complex environmental problems, such as the presence or perceived presence of hazardous substances in soil, sediment, and groundwater, persist at many contaminated properties, and can threaten the health of American families.

The&amp;nbsp;FY 2016/17 APG provides a path toward meeting long-term Agency’s priorities, as well as immediate social and economic benefits, including: reducing mortality and morbidity risks by preventing and reducing human exposure to contaminants; making land available for commercial, residential, industrial, or recreational reuse; and promoting community economic development. When sites are ready for anticipated reuse, communities are able to reclaim them for ecological, recreational, commercial, residential and other productive purposes.

Although each program establishes its own targets, the collective nature and combined overall target of the RAU Priority Goal offers an opportunity for EPA cleanup programs to work together to identify lessons learned, efficiencies and opportunities to advance site cleanup. Since EPA began collecting the number of sites RAU in FY 2008, the number of sites RAU has increased by approximately 22.3% to over 463,000 sites at the end of FY 2015, which is approximately 84% of total number of sites EPA tracks.&amp;nbsp; Similarly, the number of acres RAU increased by approximately 148%, to over 2.4 million acres, during the same period.&amp;nbsp; The total number of acres that EPA tracks represents around 3.6% of all Federal Land.&amp;nbsp; It, however, is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain the pace of RAU.&amp;nbsp;

As a result of recent resource constraints affecting programs that cleanup contaminated sites for both EPA and our Federal and State partners, the pace of ongoing construction projects is expected to be slowed, extending the timeline to achieve site cleanup and the return of sites to productive use.&amp;nbsp; Keeping RAU as the priority goal focuses senior management attention on an important indicator of program outcomes.

	&amp;nbsp;FY 2017 RAU targets will be in place for each of the four program offices.&amp;nbsp;
	A meeting will be held with the Office Directors from the contributing offices and Goal Leader to discuss implementation strategies to addressing at least one barrier or opportunity identified in the 2016 Strategic Review related to achieving RAU.
	OLEM Goal Leader will meet with the Deputy Administrator to discuss end of year RAU goal results and projections about reaching RAU goal by the end of FY 2017.&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;FY 2017: Second Quarter:


	Each OLEM contributing program office will report number of sites RAU and percent of FY2017 target achieved.


FY 2017: Third Quarter


	Office Directors from the contributing program offices will meet with OLEM Goal Leader to report on progress and outcomes of actions.


FY 2017: Fourth Quarter


	By the end of FY 2017, make approximately additional 18,600 sites RAU.

</next_steps><progress_update>FY 2016 Fourth Quarter:

In FY 2016, an additional 9,640 sites were made ready for anticipated use (RAU). Each OLEM contributing office reported the number of sites made RAU and percent of the FY 2016 target achieved as of September 30, 2016, as follows:


	Superfund: 41 sites RAU (91.1%) of the FY 2016 target of 45
	RCRA: 75 sites RAU (94%) of the FY 2016 target of 80
	LUST: 8,977 sites RAU (104%) of the FY 2016 target of 8,600
	Brownfields: 547 sites RAU (99.5%) of the FY 2016 target of 550


The number of superfund sites made site-wide RAU&amp;nbsp;came in slightly below the targeted level of 45, as expected based on Q3 results.&amp;nbsp;For RCRA, based on discussions with regions, states, and stakeholders, annual progress is likely to slow as we near completing work on the 2020 baseline facilities because the cleanups remaining to be completed include some of the more technically difficult and resource challenged facilities.

Since the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began collecting the number of sites ready for anticipated use (RAU) in FY 2008, the cumulative number of sites RAU has increased. &amp;nbsp;As of the end of FY 2015, more than 460,000&amp;nbsp;sites&amp;nbsp;were made ready for anticipated use.[1]

&amp;nbsp;


[1] The RAU is an aggregate performance measures and is not a reporting of site-specific risk.&amp;nbsp; The RAU determination by the appropriate entity is based on information at the time the determination is made and may change if the site’s conditions change or if new or additional information is discovered regarding the contamination or conditions at the site.&amp;nbsp;EPA recommends that parties interested in finding out what uses would be protective for a particular property must rely exclusively on the site-specific cleanup documents and site-specific institutional controls, and contact the appropriate regulatory agency for more information.&amp;nbsp;

All of OLEM’s cleanup programs (Superfund, RCRA corrective action, Brownfields, and LUST) contribute to this goal and take positive action to protect human health and the environment through the cleanup and revitalization of contaminated properties. OLEM programs collaborate with EPA’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assistance to deliver environmental results as One EPA.

EPA works in concert with the states, tribes, local governments, and sister federal agencies that constitute our country's environmental protection enterprise, to ensure the efficiency, efficacy, and coordination of our overlapping and complementary efforts.&amp;nbsp; In some cases, states are authorized to operate cleanup programs, while in others they are partners. Where other federal agencies are designated as the lead for the cleanup actions at their sites, EPA's environmental cleanup goals are subject to, and reliant on, the lead federal agencies' cleanup budgets, execution, and site cleanup performance. EPA recognizes the need to work with our co-regulators to build tools and strategies that enhance coordination and manage resources effectively.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Uncontrolled releases of waste and hazardous substances can contaminate our drinking water and land and threaten healthy ecosystems.  Local land use and infrastructure investments can also generate unanticipated environmental consequences, such as increased stormwater runoff, loss of open space, and increased greenhouse gas emissions.  EPA leads efforts to preserve, restore, and protect our land, air, and water so that these precious resources are available for both current and future generations.  We will continue our work to prevent and reduce exposure to contaminants, accelerate the pace of cleanups, and reduce the environmental impacts associated with land use across the country.  EPA works collaboratively with international, state, and tribal partners to achieve these aims.  In addition, we will work with communities to address risks posed by intentional and accidental releases of hazardous substances into the environment and ensure that communities have an opportunity to participate in environmental decisions that affect them.  Our efforts are guided by scientific data, research, and tools that alert us to emerging issues and inform decisions on managing materials and addressing contaminated properties.
