</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>This Priority Goal advances the Strategic Plan objective to address climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the strategic measure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from light duty vehicles and is a continuation of the FY 2012/2013 Priority Goal.&amp;nbsp; The FY 2012/2013 Priority Goal focused on the implementation of the first light-duty vehicle standards (Model Years (MY) 2012-2016) and heavy-duty standards (MY 2014-2018) to address greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from transportation activities, which accounted for 27% of U.S. GHG emissions in 2010, with the largest source being from passenger cars, light-duty trucks and freight trucks.&amp;nbsp; The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report, “Adapting to the Impacts of Climate Change,” indicates that climate change is associated with increased flooding, prolonged drought, more severe heat waves, more frequent wildfires, and changes in wetland, forest, and grassland habitats. These events result in substantial economic consequences through the contamination of drinking water resources, impaired air and water quality and reduced capacity of ecosystems to provide the services to society that we depend upon.

It is important to continue this APG because both the light-duty (MY 2012-2016) and heavy-duty vehicle rules are in the early stages of implementation, and the real benefits of these rules will not be realized until later years. For light-duty rules, the implementation for vehicles started in 2012, and will ramp up each year until 2025. For the heavy-duty rule, EPA is in the early credit earning phase, and will start in 2014/2015 to implement the first standards and assess compliance for the 2014 model year. The next phase includes incorporating the GHG standards in the light-duty vehicle rule for model years 2017-2025 (finalized in August 2012) and transitioning from the voluntary early credit earning phase (i.e., credit banking/trading, off-cycle credits, air-conditioning improvement credits) of the heavy-duty rule to the implementation phase of the 2014 model year standards.

4th Quarter, FY 2015

Light-Duty GHG Standards

In our Action Plan and previous quarterly reports, we set the following milestones and targets for Q4 for light-duty GHG standards:


	
	Continue issuing certificates for light-duty models that meet testing criteria.
	
	
	Confirmatory (spot check) test approximately 20-25 manufacturer pre-production certification vehicles to confirm their greenhouse gas emissions results.
	
	
	Begin compiling 2015 Model Year Performance Report.
	
	
	Annual target in FY 2015 for light-duty coastdown testing is 15-20 vehicles. Actual number of tests conducted per quarter will be dependent on a number of factors such as securing testing sites and weather conditions.
	


For light-duty standards, we do not set targets for number of certificates issued because it is dependent on the number of requests submitted by manufacturers. However, we continue to issue light duty certificates in a timely manner and in pace with the numbers of requests that we receive.&amp;nbsp; In Q4 of FY 2015, we issued 208 light-duty certificates of conformity, and confirmatory tested 55 manufacturer pre-production certification vehicles to confirm their greenhouse gas emissions results. For the light duty coastdown surveillance testing, two vehicles were tested.&amp;nbsp; A draft of the 2014 Model Year performance report was completed. The report will be published in the first half of Fiscal Year 2016.

Heavy-Duty GHG Standards

In our Action Plan and previous quarterly reports, we set the following milestones and targets for Q4 heavy-duty GHG standards:


	
	Continue issuing certificates for heavy-duty engines, vehicles, tractors and vocational trucks that meet all greenhouse gas requirements.
	
	
	Deploy data system for certification for heavy-duty engines.
	


For heavy-duty standards, we do not set targets for number of certificates issued because it is dependent on the number of requests submitted by manufacturers. However, we continue to issue heavy duty certificates in a timely manner and in pace with the numbers of requests that we receive. In Q4, EPA issued a total of 30 heavy-duty certificates of conformity.

The EPA is meeting the commitment to continue developing data systems for certification and end-of-year compliance calculations for heavy-duty tractors and vocational vehicles.&amp;nbsp; These systems will be used by the manufacturers for submitting required information and by EPA for assessing compliance with the GHG requirements. From July 2015 through September 2015, EPA continued developing greenhouse gas certification data systems. System development for the heavy-duty engine module was completed and the system was deployed in August. This module is part of the Verify System, a comprehensive data management system that facilitates EPA certification and compliance oversight and replaces the interim solutions that were developed when the heavy-duty greenhouse gas rule was promulgated.

&amp;nbsp;

Overall Results

At the end of this two year goal period, the EPA successfully achieved its milestones for early implementation of the LD program and the optional early credit phase for heavy duty program. The earliest EPA vehicle and truck CO2 standards represent the first time that the Agency regulated greenhouse gas emissions. The scope of the GHG program and the requisite evolution of the vehicle and engine industries meant that EPA was working with stakeholders (truck, vehicle and engine manufacturers) that had varying levels of experience with EPA and with mobile source emissions compliance programs.&amp;nbsp; These circumstances required EPA to develop entirely new internal and external oversight and compliance capabilities. These early challenges continue as the program matures, particularly with respect to developing testing protocols and IT systems necessary to assist with reporting on the status of manufacturers’ compliance with the program.

In addition, the EPA successfully achieved its annual performance targets set for FY 2014 and FY 2015. As of September 30, 2015 EPA issued 1,706 certificates of conformity for vehicles and engines that complied with the requirements of both the LD and HD GHG programs, 331 manufacturer pre-production certification vehicles that were confirmatory (spot check) tested to confirm their greenhouse gas emissions results and values, and 35 production vehicles were surveillance tested at a test track to determine accuracy of manufacturer’s road load calculations. Over the two year goal period, we implemented the following key components of the LD and HD GHG vehicle program:

Light-Duty


	
	EPA continued the test program to test production vehicles at a test track to verify the road load estimates generated by manufacturers for laboratory testing.&amp;nbsp;
	
	
	EPA collected and analyzed light duty manufacturer submissions for GHG reports for 2012, 2013, and 2014 model years.

	
		
		EPA completed the 2013 Model Year performance report (published during the third quarter FY 2015)
		
		
		EPA completed a draft of the 2014 Model Year performance report. The report will go out in the first half of Fiscal Year 2016.
		
		
		EPA will begin compiling 2015 Model Year performance report.
		
	
	


Heavy-Duty


	
	From October 2013 through September 2015, EPA continued developing greenhouse gas certification data systems. System development for the heavy-duty engine module and the system was deployed into production in August. This module is part of the Verify System, a comprehensive data management system that facilitates EPA certification and compliance oversight and replaces the interim solutions that were developed when the heavy-duty greenhouse gas rule was promulgated.
	
	
	EPA serves as the sole source of collection for both GHG emissions data and fuel consumption data.&amp;nbsp; EPA developed an automated process for transmitting fuel consumption data to DOT’s National Highway and Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) to allow them to implement portions of the joint HD rule.
	
	
	For the Heavy-Duty Tractor and Vocational Vehicle Production Volume Reports we have also implemented a GEM validation feature which allows the Cert Reps to audit the manufacturers GEM values. To date, 6 manufacturers have submitted ABT reports and 1 manufacturer submitted a Production Volume report.
	


&amp;nbsp;

Looking Ahead to FY 2016-2017

The FY 2014-2015 APG focused on incorporating the light-duty GHG standards for model years 2017-2025 and transitioning from the voluntary early credit earning phase (i.e., credit banking/trading, off-cycle credits, air-conditioning improvement credits) to full implementation of the 2014-2018 heavy-duty rule. This Priority Goal is a continuation of the FY 2012-2013 APG, which focused on the implementation of the first light-duty vehicle standards (MY 2012-2016) and preparing for the implementation of heavy-duty standards (MY 2014-2018). It was important to continue this APG because both the light-duty (MY 2012-2016) and heavy-duty vehicle rules are in the early stages of implementation, and the real benefits of these rules will not be realized until later years.

Looking forward, the FY 2016-2017 APG will build upon the successes of the related FY 2014-2015 and FY 2012-2013 Agency Priority Goals.&amp;nbsp; The focus of the FY 2016-2017 APG will be on manufacturer compliance with the standards, the natural progression as the programs mature. EPA will continue to track issuing certificates and confirmatory testing but will also track new reporting metrics to capture compliance activities.

The EPA will also be facing new challenges associated with this new focus. The key challenges include management of the extensive effort required to develop the annual manufacturer’s performance report for the light duty program and, for the first time, developing a similar report for the heavy-duty program. These reports require EPA to track, analyze, and compile considerable amounts of compliance data and credit transactions reported by manufacturers for each model year and to ensure data accuracy and completeness of submissions. To date, EPA has issued three manufacturer’s performance reports for the early credit program (2009-2011 model years), the 2012 model year, and the 2013 model year under the light-duty program and continues to work on ways to effectively streamline the data collection, verification, and production of these reports. For the heavy duty program, EPA will break new ground as we build these reports from the reported manufacturer’s compliance data under varying program requirements and multiple program flexibilities.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Climate change poses risks to human health, the environment, cultural resources, the economy, and quality of life.[1]  These changes are expected to create further challenges to protecting human health and welfare.  Many effects of a changing climate are already evident and will persist into the future regardless of future levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  For example, average U.S. temperatures are rising, snow and rainfall patterns are shifting, and more extreme climate events—like heavy rainstorms and record high temperatures—are already affecting society, human health, and the environment.  Potential climate change impacts may also make it more difficult to achieve clean air goals.  To better protect human health and the environment, EPA must recognize and consider the challenge a changing climate poses to the environment. 
 
Notwithstanding this challenge, since passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments in 1990, nationwide air quality has improved significantly.[2]  Levels of those pollutants linked to the greatest health impacts continue to decline.  From 2003 to 2011, population-weighted ambient concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone have decreased 26 percent and 16 percent, respectively.  Even with this progress, in 2010 approximately 40 percent of the U.S. population lived in counties with air that did not meet health-based standards for at least one pollutant.  Long-term exposure to elevated levels of certain air pollutants has been associated with increased risk of cancer, premature mortality, and damage to the immune, neurological, reproductive, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems.[3]  Because people spend much of their lives indoors, the quality of indoor air is also a major health concern.  Indoor allergens and irritants play a significant role in making asthma worse and triggering asthma attacks.  The most recent data (2011) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tell us that 26 million Americans have asthma, and in 2010, CDC reports that asthma was the primary diagnosis for nearly 2 million hospital emergency visits.[4]  In 2008, more than half of children and one-third of adults who had an asthma attack missed school or work because of asthma and total costs for Americans from asthma was $56 billion in 2007.[5]   Exposure to indoor radon is responsible for an estimated 21,000 premature lung cancer deaths each year.[6]  Twenty percent of the population spends the day indoors in elementary and secondary schools, where potential problems with leaky roofs and with heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems can trigger a host of health problems, including asthma and allergies.

</objective_statement><objective_overview>EPA’s strategies to address climate change reflect the President’s call to action in his Climate Action Plan (June 2013), which, among other initiatives, tasks EPA with setting carbon dioxide (CO2) standards for power plants and applying the Agency’s authorities and other tools to address hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and methane.  These strategies support the President's goal to reduce GHG emissions by 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020.[1]  EPA and its partners are developing and implementing approaches to reduce GHG emissions domestically and internationally through cost-effective, voluntary programs while pursuing additional regulatory actions as needed.  Our efforts address the following areas:
 
Mobile Sources
 
Implementing three sets of GHG standards for vehicles and trucks, including:  two sets of GHG standards for light-duty cars and trucks (model years 2012-2016 and 2017-2025); and the first set of standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks and buses (model years 2014-2018).  These emission standards, finalized jointly with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) fuel economy standards, will result in substantial reductions in new vehicle GHG emissions from model years 2012 through 2025.  (Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks is an FY 2014-2015 Agency Priority Goal.[2])
Carrying out the next phase of the GHG vehicle emission standards.  Consistent with the President’s Climate Action Plan, the Agency plans to propose in March 2015 a second phase of fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emission standards for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles for model years 2018 and beyond, and plans to finalize the standards in March 2016.  This second phase of regulations will build upon the success of the first phase and offer further opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and decrease transportation fuel consumption, and is expected to benefit consumers and business by reducing the cost of transporting goods while spurring job growth and innovation in the clean energy technology sector.
Assessing GHG control options for non-road sources, including evaluating whether and when to commence work on standards setting for GHG emissions from a wide range of non-road equipment, locomotives, marine vessels and aircraft, and transportation fuels.
Stationary Sources
Using authority under Section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act, EPA  issued a new proposal on September 20, 2013 for GHG performance standards for new power plants and will subsequently finalize that rule after consideration of public comment as appropriate.  Using authority under Sections 111(b) and 111(d) of the Act, EPA will issue proposed GHG standards, regulations, or guidelines, as appropriate, for modified, reconstructed, and existing power plants by June 1, 2014, and finalize these standards, regulations, or guidelines by June 1, 2015.
Collecting and publishing high-quality GHG emissions data from large direct emitters and suppliers of GHGs through the greenhouse gas reporting program to inform the public and support sound, data-driven, policy decisions on climate change.
Implementing permitting requirements for facilities that emit large amounts of GHGs to encourage design and construction of more sustainable, efficient, and advanced processes that will contribute to a clean energy economy.
Applying the Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) program to promote the use of low global warming potential HFCs and similar chemicals.
 
International and Other Efforts
Implementing proven voluntary programs that maximize GHG reductions through the greater use of technologies, products, and practices that promote energy efficiency, and renewables programs and policies that benefit the environment and human health.
Identifying and assessing substitute chemical and ozone-depleting substances and processes for their global warming potential.
Collaborating with countries and other international partners to reduce methane emissions and deliver clean energy to markets around the world through the Global Methane Initiative.
Collaborating with international partners to reduce short-lived climate pollutants, including methane, black carbon, and hydrofluorocarbons, through the Climate and Clean Air Coalition.
Educating the public about a changing climate and actions people can take to reduce GHG emissions.
Collaborating with state, local, and tribal governments on regulatory and policy initiatives, technical assistance, and voluntary programs related to climate change mitigation and adaptation.
 
Adaptation
Much of EPA’s work is sensitive to weather and climate.  Consequently, the various actions EPA takes to meet its obligations and achieve its goals, including promulgating regulations and implementing programs, take these variables into consideration.  For example, potential increases in ground-level ozone due to a changing climate could make attainment or maintenance of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) more challenging.  Similarly, attaining water quality standards will become more difficult as water temperatures increase in response to climate change.
EPA must adapt and plan for future changes in climate to continue fulfilling its statutory, regulatory, and programmatic requirements.  The Agency will implement its Climate Change Adaptation Plan, and consider where it is appropriate to integrate and mainstream considerations of a changing climate into the full range of its programs to ensure they are effective under future climatic conditions.  EPA will work with state, tribal, and local partners to enhance their capacity to adapt to a changing climate.  Each of the EPA national programs and ten regional offices will implement new climate adaptation implementation plans to carry out the work called for in the Agency’s Climate Change Adaptation Plan.  EPA will also continue to collaborate with the U.S. Global Change Research Program and the Council on Climate Change Preparedness and Resilience to support the development and implementation of climate change adaptation plans by all federal agencies.[3]
Adaptation initiatives undertaken by EPA national programs and regional offices will carry out key elements of the President’s Climate Action Plan (June 2013) and aim to increase the resilience of communities and ecosystems to climate change by increasing their ability to anticipate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from the impacts of a changing climate.  EPA is encouraging and supporting smarter, more resilient investments by integrating considerations of climate change impacts and adaptive measures into major grant, loan, contract, and technical assistance programs, consistent with existing authorities.  For example, EPA is integrating climate adaptation criteria into the Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Funds and grants for brownfields cleanup.  EPA is also partnering with states, tribes, and urban and rural communities to integrate climate change data, models, information, and other decision-support tools into their planning processes in ways that empower them to anticipate, prepare for, and adapt to a changing climate.  As an example, EPA developed a stormwater calculator that will enable users to evaluate the effectiveness of alternative strategies for limiting stormwater runoff that can overwhelm sewer systems and spill into rivers and streams, and to identify strategies that ensure the systems are effective under future climatic conditions.
 
External Factors and Emerging Issues
External influences on EPA’s efforts to improve air quality and address climate change issues include the evolution of state and local transportation and energy-related policies and the impacts of a changing climate, such as changes in rainfall amount and intensity, shifting weather and seasonal patterns, and increases in flood plain elevations and sea levels.  Some of these external influences present significant challenges to the EPA’s work, whereas others, such as the growth of alternative energy sources and increased investments in energy efficiency, can improve local air quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

FY 2014-2015 Agency Priority Goal:  Reduce greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles and trucks: Through September 30, 2015, EPA in coordination with Department of Transportation’s fuel economy standards program will be implementing vehicle and truck greenhouse gas (GHG) standards that are projected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 billion metric tons and reduce oil consumption by about 12 billion barrels over the lifetime of the affected vehicles and trucks.
The U.S. Global Change Research Program coordinates and integrates federal research on changes in the global environment and the implications of these changes for society, as mandated in the Global Change Research Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-606) (http://www.globalchange.gov/about/global-change-research-act.html).  In 2009, the White House Council on Environmental Quality, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration initiated the Interagency Climate Change Adaptation Task Force.  When the President signed Executive Order 13514, Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic Performance, in October 2009, he called on the Task Force to develop federal recommendations for adapting to climate change impacts both domestically and internationally.  Executive Order 13514 is available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/President-Obama-signs-an-Executive-Order-Focused-on-Federal-Leadership-in-Environmental-Energy-and-Economic-Performance.
