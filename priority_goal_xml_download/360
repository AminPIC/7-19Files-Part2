</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Environmental regulators face ever growing needs to share information within and across agencies, reduce staff burden of data entry, reduce regulatory reporting burdens, and improve environmental and human health protection. There is also an increasing expectation from the public and regulated community for the use of on-line systems and the desire for data transparency and personalized access. Both federal and state agencies recognize that easier access to and use of environmental data will facilitate better environmental protection and decision-making while also increasing overall data transparency.

&amp;nbsp;

Consistent with the 2012 White House Digital Government Strategy and Executive Order 13563, EPA seeks to transform the way business is conducted. E-Enterprise for the Environment is a joint initiative of states and EPA to improve environmental outcomes and enhance service to the regulated community and the public by maximizing the use of advanced monitoring and information technologies, optimizing operations, and increasing transparency. E-Enterprise will enable new environmental management approaches by modernizing EPA programs and regulations while streamlining and improving existing business processes. E-Enterprise will use the transformational capabilities of information and advanced monitoring technologies to identify and implement programmatic and service improvements.

&amp;nbsp;

These improvements will include “smart” tools and services that guide the regulated community in understanding and fulfilling their federal, state and, local regulatory reporting obligations, offer basic validations and error checking of entered information, and support electronic signature submissions. E-Enterprise projects that take advantage of tools and practices such as advanced monitoring technology and streamlined data collection will also expand the ability of the government, regulated entities, and the public to see and measure pollutant discharges, emissions and environmental conditions. A fundamental premise of E-Enterprise is that providing a more complete and integrated (cross media - air, water, and land) view of environmental data can support greener behavior of the public and regulated entities. For example, broad availability of high-speed internet allows real-time reporting of emissions and provides unprecedented opportunities for transparency and public involvement in matters affecting local environmental conditions. These technological advances will allow better tracking of environmental progress. Innovative technology can also help regulators improve compliance with environmental laws.

&amp;nbsp;
</progress_update><themes><theme>Natural Resources and Environment</theme></themes><contributing_programs_and_other_factors>E-Enterprise is a collaborative effort and seeks to take advantage of the shared vision between states and EPA to improve environmental outcomes and dramatically enhance service to the regulated community and the public. In September 2013, EPA’s Administrator and ECOS President signed the charter for State and EPA E-Enterprise Leadership Council.

&amp;nbsp;

As E-Enterprise moves forward, EPA and states will broaden the collaboration to include other environmental regulators including tribes, municipalities and other authorities. E-Enterprise will also invite input from the regulated community, non-governmental organizations, educational institutions and the public. Specifically, the public, industry, and trade associations will be informed and involved through proposed regulation comment periods, and websites in support of rules. Also, EPA will be encouraging private sector development of reporting tools to drive innovation, reduce costs, and help regulated entities to comply through increased transparency and access to environmental data.
</contributing_programs_and_other_factors></Agency_Priority_Goal><Strategic_Goals><Strategic_Goal><id>3328</id><strategic_goal_header>Addressing Climate Change and Improving Air Quality</strategic_goal_header><strategic_goal_statement>Reduce greenhouse gas emissions and develop adaptation strategies to address climate change, and protect and improve air quality. 
</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Climate change poses risks to human health, the environment, cultural resources, the economy, and quality of life.[1]  These changes are expected to create further challenges to protecting human health and welfare.  Many effects of a changing climate are already evident and will persist into the future regardless of future levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  For example, average U.S. temperatures are rising, snow and rainfall patterns are shifting, and more extreme climate events—like heavy rainstorms and record high temperatures—are already affecting society, human health, and the environment.  Potential climate change impacts may also make it more difficult to achieve clean air goals.  To better protect human health and the environment, EPA must recognize and consider the challenge a changing climate poses to the environment. 
 
Notwithstanding this challenge, since passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments in 1990, nationwide air quality has improved significantly.[2]  Levels of those pollutants linked to the greatest health impacts continue to decline.  From 2003 to 2011, population-weighted ambient concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone have decreased 26 percent and 16 percent, respectively.  Even with this progress, in 2010 approximately 40 percent of the U.S. population lived in counties with air that did not meet health-based standards for at least one pollutant.  Long-term exposure to elevated levels of certain air pollutants has been associated with increased risk of cancer, premature mortality, and damage to the immune, neurological, reproductive, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems.[3]  Because people spend much of their lives indoors, the quality of indoor air is also a major health concern.  Indoor allergens and irritants play a significant role in making asthma worse and triggering asthma attacks.  The most recent data (2011) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tell us that 26 million Americans have asthma, and in 2010, CDC reports that asthma was the primary diagnosis for nearly 2 million hospital emergency visits.[4]  In 2008, more than half of children and one-third of adults who had an asthma attack missed school or work because of asthma and total costs for Americans from asthma was $56 billion in 2007.[5]   Exposure to indoor radon is responsible for an estimated 21,000 premature lung cancer deaths each year.[6]  Twenty percent of the population spends the day indoors in elementary and secondary schools, where potential problems with leaky roofs and with heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems can trigger a host of health problems, including asthma and allergies.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Uncontrolled releases of waste and hazardous substances can contaminate our drinking water and land and threaten healthy ecosystems.  Local land use and infrastructure investments can also generate unanticipated environmental consequences, such as increased stormwater runoff, loss of open space, and increased greenhouse gas emissions.  EPA leads efforts to preserve, restore, and protect our land, air, and water so that these precious resources are available for both current and future generations.  We will continue our work to prevent and reduce exposure to contaminants, accelerate the pace of cleanups, and reduce the environmental impacts associated with land use across the country.  EPA works collaboratively with international, state, and tribal partners to achieve these aims.  In addition, we will work with communities to address risks posed by intentional and accidental releases of hazardous substances into the environment and ensure that communities have an opportunity to participate in environmental decisions that affect them.  Our efforts are guided by scientific data, research, and tools that alert us to emerging issues and inform decisions on managing materials and addressing contaminated properties. 
 
</strategic_goal_overview><strategic_goal_sequence>3</strategic_goal_sequence></Strategic_Goal><Strategic_Goal><id>3315</id><strategic_goal_header>Protecting Human Health  and the Environment by Enforcing Laws and Assuring Compliance</strategic_goal_header><strategic_goal_statement>Protect human health and the environment through vigorous and targeted civil and criminal enforcement.  Use Next Generation Compliance strategies and tools to improve compliance with environmental laws.  
</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Vigorous enforcement supports EPA’s ambitious mission to protect human health and the environment.  Achieving our goals for water that is safe to drink, lakes and streams that are fishable and swimmable, air that is clean to breathe, and communities and neighborhoods that are free from chemical contamination requires both new strategies and compliance with the rules we already have.  To help achieve these goals, EPA authorizes state, tribal, and territorial agencies to directly implement environmental laws.  Federal, state, and tribal agencies work cooperatively together as co-regulators to achieve compliance, with delegated or authorized states conducting the vast majority of enforcement activities across the country.  By addressing noncompliance swiftly and effectively, state, tribal, and EPA civil and criminal enforcement cases directly reduce pollution and risk, and deter others from violating the law.
 
EPA will continue to focus federal enforcement resources on the most important environmental problems where noncompliance is a significant contributing factor, and where federal enforcement attention can have a significant impact.  This strategy means EPA’s top enforcement priority will be pursuing large, complex cases that require significant investment and a long-term commitment.  We anticipate this strategy will result in a higher level of public health protection because of the significant impacts associated with the large cases, and the precedent they set for performance of large facilities across the country.  
 
Our commitment to the largest most complex cases that have the biggest impact necessarily means that we will be doing fewer cases overall.  This approach best protects public health not only by addressing the most serious pollution problems, but also by directing EPA’s resources to important cases that may not be addressed by states because the environmental and human health risks or the patterns of noncompliance are broad in scope and scale such that EPA is best suited to take action.  This strategy will also help maintain the enforcement program’s effectiveness given limited resources.  The 5-year targets for the enforcement program’s strategic measures reflect the anticipated effects of this approach.
 
As an important supplement to a strong enforcement program, EPA is investing in “Next Generation Compliance” using advanced technologies and embracing new strategies for rule design and case targeting.  Robust enforcement is critically important for addressing violations and promoting deterrence.  But enforcement alone will not be enough to achieve compliance results that protect public health or to assure that businesses that comply with the law do not have to compete with companies that do not play by the rules.  Next Generation Compliance takes advantage of new information and monitoring technologies as well innovative strategies to make rules and permits more effective, enabling EPA, states, and tribes to get better compliance results and tackle today’s compliance challenges.  Next Generation Compliance will help EPA and the states move toward achieving more reliable compliance with standards designed to protect the public and the environment.  It is the right direction for the Agency regardless of resources because it will increase effectiveness, and it becomes more urgent in a time of challenging budgets, when we need to reduce pollution, improve compliance, and target our enforcement cases where they will make the most difference.

Modernize the EPA-state relationship, including revitalizing the National Environmental Performance Partnership System and jointly pursuing E-Enterprise, a transformative approach to make environmental information and data more accessible, efficient, and evidence-based through advances in monitoring, reporting, and information technology. 
</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>The practice of good government, as well as the reality of limited resources, means that EPA works in concert with our partners to improve coordination, promote innovation, and maximize efficiencies to ensure our continued success.  As we work together, our relationships must continue to be based on integrity, trust, and shared accountability to make the most effective use of our respective bodies of knowledge, our existing authorities, our resources, and our talents. 
 
Successful partnerships will be based on four working principles:  consultation, collaboration, cooperation, and accountability.  By consulting, we will engage our partners in a timely fashion as we consider approaches to our environmental work so that each partner can make an early and meaningful contribution toward the final result.  By collaborating, we will not only share information, but we will actively work together with our partners to develop innovative approaches that use and leverage all available resources to achieve our environmental and human health goals.  As our work progresses, we will cooperate, viewing each other with respect as allies who must work successfully together if our goals are to be achieved.  Through shared accountability, we will ensure that environmental benefits are consistently delivered nationwide.  In carrying out these responsibilities, EPA will ensure that state, tribal, and federal implementation of federal laws achieves a consistent level of protection for the environment and human health.
 
With States
 
Under our federal environmental laws, EPA and the states share responsibility for protecting human health and the environment.  With this relationship as a key component of the nation's environmental protection system, EPA will: 
 
Improve implementation of national environmental programs through closer consultation and collaboration to seek the most efficient use of resources, streamline business processes and administrative requirements, develop and promote innovative solutions, and further our shared governance framework by revitalizing the National Environmental Performance Partnership System (NEPPS).[1]  We will strengthen joint EPA-state priority setting by better aligning NEPPS with EPA’s national program manager guidances[2], focusing on flexible, innovative approaches to achieve results, and seek ways to leverage all available mutually beneficial opportunities to share work and expertise.
Work collaboratively with state partners to develop innovative strategies and modernize our environmental programs through the E-Enterprise initiative[3], a 21st century approach that will support the nation’s environmental protection responsibilities through enhanced information sharing, increased transparency, and reduced regulatory burden, supported by advanced monitoring tools and information technologies.
Consult with state governments early in the rule-making process to ensure that the development and implementation of rules is consistent with “EPA’s Action Development Process:  Guidance on Executive Order 13132 (Federalism),” which recognizes the division of governmental responsibilities between the federal government and the states.
Strengthen state-EPA shared accountability by focusing oversight on the most significant and pressing state program performance challenges, using data and analysis to accelerate program improvements.
Ensure a level playing field across states to improve compliance and address the most serious violations.
Collaborate with state research organizations to share information on EPA’s scientific and technical capabilities and solicit input to make our tools, models, and research useful and practical for the states in carrying out their environmental responsibilities. 
 
With Tribes
 
The relationship between the United States government and federally-recognized tribes is unique—we work with tribes on a government-to-government basis on Agency decisions that may affect tribal interests.  Our responsibility to consult with tribal governments is distinct from the general consultations we have with states and nations outside the U.S. border.  As such, our consultations with tribes are governed by the EPA Policy for the Administration of Environmental Programs on Indian Reservations (November 8, 1984), Executive Order 13175 on Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments, and the Agency’s Policy on Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribes (May 4, 2011).  In strengthening this relationship with tribes, EPA will:
 
Focus on increasing tribal capacity to establish and implement environmental programs while ensuring that our national programs are as effective in Indian country as they are throughout the rest of the nation.[4]
Enhance our effort to work with tribes on a government-to-government basis, based upon the Constitution, treaties, laws, executive orders, and a long history of Supreme Court rulings.
Strengthen our cross-cultural sensitivity with tribes, recognizing that tribes have cultural, jurisdictional, and legal features that must be considered when coordinating and implementing environmental programs in Indian country.
 
With Local Partners:
EPA has a unique relationship with local governments given that local governments can be both co-implementers and regulated entities under national and state environmental laws.  Recognizing that local governments vary considerably[5], are dealing with significant resource constraints as they work to build capacity (particularly in smaller communities), and often provide innovative leadership in environmental stewardship, EPA will:
 
Maintain consistent and meaningful communications with local officials and optimize outreach efforts to improve environmental program implementation at the local level and receive recommendations on environmental issues that are important to local governments.
Consult with local governments, as with states, early in the development of rules and policies that impact them, consistent with “EPA’s Action Development Process:  Guidance on Executive Order 13132 (Federalism).” 
Promote and facilitate best practices among local officials to address pressing local environmental matters with flexible, innovative approaches that advance shared priorities.
 
With International Partners
To achieve our domestic environmental and human health goals, international partnerships, including those with the business community and entrepreneurs, are essential.  Pollution is often carried by winds and water across national boundaries, posing risks to human health and ecosystems many hundreds and thousands of miles away.  Many concerns, like climate change, are global and, to address these and other environmental challenges in the international arena, EPA will:
Enhance sustainability principles through expanded partnership efforts in multilateral forums and in key bilateral relationships. 
Strengthen existing and build new international partnerships to encourage increased international commitment to sustainability goals and to promote a new era of global environmental stewardship based on common interests, shared values, and mutual respect.
 
End Notes:
NEPPS is an environmental performance system established in 1995 and designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of state environmental programs and EPA-state partnerships.  It is a system of principles and tools to drive performance, efficiency, and flexibility in the EPA-state relationship.  It enables EPA and states to leverage their collective resources most efficiently and effectively by taking full advantage of the unique capacities and capabilities of each partner to achieve the maximum environmental and human health protection.  The primary tools for establishing priorities and deploying resources are Performance Partnership Agreements (PPAs) and Performance Partnership Grants (PPGs).  PPGs allow states and tribes to combine categorical grants for greater spending flexibility on state and tribal priorities.  PPAs are strategic negotiated plans that articulate joint goals and priorities, key activities, and roles and responsibilities.
EPA’s national program manager (NPM) guidances translate the Agency’s budget decisions into operational program priorities, strategies, and performance measures.  Issued by the five major environmental programs (air, water, waste, chemical safety and pollution prevention, and enforcement and compliance assurance), the NPM guidances inform the development of EPA work plans and grant agreements with states and tribes, including Performance Partnership Agreements, Performance Partnership Grants, and/or programmatic grants.
EPA has developed an FY 2014-2015 Agency Priority Goal for E-Enterprise:  Improve environmental outcomes and enhance service to the regulated community and the public.  By September 30, 2015, reduce reporting burdens to EPA by one million hours through streamlined regulations, provide real-time environmental data to at least two communities, and establish a new portal to service the regulated community and public.  More information on Agency Priority Goals is available at http://goals.performance.gov/agency/epa.
EPA recently issued new guidance for the Indian Environmental General Assistance Program, “Guidance on the Award and Management of General Assistance Agreements for Tribes and Intertribal Consortia,” May 15, 2013.  The General Assistance Program (GAP) Guidance is designed to enhance the EPA-tribal partnership by establishing a framework for joint strategic planning, identification of mutual responsibilities, and targeting resources to build tribal environmental program capacities.  Additionally, it augments existing GAP Guidance with a guidebook of program development indicators, providing “pathways” for capacity building and ways to measure development of programs over time.
Local governments may include counties, cities, water districts, air districts, ports, municipal waste management associations, economic development councils, metropolitan councils of government, and other entities.

EPA’s compelling mission to protect human health and the environment attracts workers eager to make a difference.  EPA cultivates a highly skilled and diverse workforce, with employees energized by opportunities to learn and work collaboratively, and equipped to do their best work for the American people.  In building a high-performing organization, the Agency is working to provide employees with a modern, inclusive, and flexible work environment, enabled by advanced information technologies and tools that enhance communication, transparency, and cooperative problem solving across the Agency and with our partners.
 
EPA is now moving forward with two major initiatives that are part of our efforts to create the next generation of environmental protection in our nation. 
 
 E-Enterprise is a U.S. EPA-state initiative to improve environmental performance and enhance services to the regulated community, environmental agencies, and the public.  As described in the E-Enterprise for the Environment Conceptual Blueprint, “E-Enterprise will increase transparency and efficiency, develop new environmental management approaches, and employ advanced information and monitoring technologies in a coordinated effort to manage and modernize environmental programs.”[1]  For example, this initiative will move us from using paper to electronic transactions, increase the use of advanced monitoring technologies to obtain better, more complete information on environmental conditions and pollution sources, and deliver data that is transparent, readily available, and understandable to EPA, the states, and the general public.  Through E-Enterprise, the entire environmental protection enterprise (federal, state, local, and tribal partners) will be able to regularly conduct two-way business electronically in an integrated way, reducing costs while enhancing environmental protection.
 
EPA is moving forward to adopt Next Generation Compliance principles and  tools to increase compliance and reduce pollution.  Next Generation Compliance uses advances in research, pollutant monitoring, and information technology; expanded transparency; electronic reporting; and innovative enforcement to reduce pollution and improve results.  These tools, combined with a focus on designing rules and permits that are easier to implement, enable EPA, states, and tribes to focus on the most serious environmental problems and to better protect communities.
 
The Agency will focus on streamlining internal business processes and decision making at all levels.  To stay current, programs must be constantly reevaluated to ensure they are well focused and cutting edge.  Promulgated regulations should maximize environmental benefit while minimizing costs.  EPA is committed to process improvement through the application of Lean methodologies and other business practice improvement techniques, as well as the engagement of the expertise and insights of Agency employees to identify opportunities to increase efficiency and effectiveness.[2]
 
By combining the strengths of a supportive work environment with a streamlined and collaborative business culture, EPA will establish itself as a high-performing organization known for advancing the talents, drive, and interests of employees, as well as the collaborative work in support of our common mission and the public we serve.  EPA will:
 
Maintain and attract the workforce of the future to ensure that EPA’s employees represent diverse backgrounds and perspectives, are equipped with the most current technical skills, tools, and knowledge, and are positioned to effectively accomplish the Agency’s mission and meet evolving environmental and sustainability challenges.
 
Cultivate a work environment that offers a high-quality work life for all employees by engaging them in shaping Agency decisions and improving processes, and providing flexible work practices, fair and inclusive employee-friendly policies, and opportunities for continuous learning.  EPA will modernize the workplace and develop and promote collaboration tools to improve communication, cross-program integration, access to information, and transparency.
 
Advance the E-Enterprise initiative to improve environmental outcomes, enhance service to the regulated community and public, and reduce burden and improve collaborative management among EPA, states, tribes, and others.  E-Enterprise will increase collaboration with the states as we modernize regulations to make e-reporting the “new normal” and use advanced monitoring to provide more complete and useful environmental data.  Key parts of E-Enterprise will be shared information technology services and tools that states and EPA programs use and, in collaboration with the states, the development of a regulatory portal that will help regulated entities electronically report to the states and EPA.  The development of E-Enterprise is one of EPA’s Priority Goals.[3]
 
In addition to compliance monitoring and enforcement actions, implement Next Generation Compliance by promoting the use of advanced monitoring and electronic reporting, designing rules that are easier to implement, expanding transparency, and using innovative enforcement approaches to increase compliance and reduce pollution. 
 
Streamline the Agency’s internal business practices, core program processes, and decision making in areas such as acquisition and grants management, rulemaking, and permitting to ensure they are cutting edge, enhance collaboration, and improve efficiency and cost effectiveness while maximizing environmental benefits.
 
Practice outstanding financial resource stewardship to ensure that all Agency programs use resources efficiently, operate with fiscal responsibility and management integrity, are effectively and consistently delivered nationwide, and demonstrate results.
 
Achieve or exceed federal sustainability targets.  These efforts, enhanced by sustainable workplace choices that can be routinely practiced by Agency employees, will continue to reduce EPA’s environmental footprint by increasing energy efficiency, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, advancing water conservation, and reducing waste, and will provide lessons learned to share with other federal agencies.

Cultivate a work environment that offers a high-quality work life for all employees by engaging them in shaping Agency decisions and improving processes, and providing flexible work practices, fair and inclusive employee-friendly policies, and opportunities for continuous learning. EPA will modernize the workplace and develop and promote collaboration tools to improve communication, cross-program integration, access to information, and transparency.
 
Advance the E-Enterprise initiative to improve environmental outcomes, enhance service to the regulated community and public, and reduce burden and improve collaborative management among EPA, states, tribes, and others. E-Enterprise will increase collaboration with the states as we modernize regulations to make e-reporting the “new normal” and use advanced monitoring to provide more complete and useful environmental data. Key parts of E-Enterprise will be shared information technology services and tools that states and EPA programs use and, in collaboration with the states, the development of a regulatory portal that will help regulated entities electronically report to the states and EPA. The development of E-Enterprise is one of EPA’s Priority Goals.[3]
 
In addition to compliance monitoring and enforcement actions, implement Next Generation Compliance by promoting the use of advanced monitoring and electronic reporting, designing rules that are easier to implement, expanding transparency, and using innovative enforcement approaches to increase compliance and reduce pollution.
 
Streamline the Agency’s internal business practices, core program processes, and decision making in areas such as acquisition and grants management, rulemaking, and permitting to ensure they are cutting edge, enhance collaboration, and improve efficiency and cost effectiveness while maximizing environmental benefits.
 
Practice outstanding financial resource stewardship to ensure that all Agency programs use resources efficiently, operate with fiscal responsibility and management integrity, are effectively and consistently delivered nationwide, and demonstrate results.
 
Achieve or exceed federal sustainability targets. These efforts, enhanced by sustainable workplace choices that can be routinely practiced by Agency employees, will continue to reduce EPA’s environmental footprint by increasing energy efficiency, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, advancing water conservation, and reducing waste, and will provide lessons learned to share with other federal agencies.
