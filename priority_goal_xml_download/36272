By September 30, 2017, NASA will have begun integration and testing of the Exploration Mission (EM)-1 Orion Crew Module (CM), including the first power-on of the vehicle; delivered all four EM-1 Space Launch System (SLS) Core Stage RS-25 engines to the Michoud Assembly Facility in preparation for integration into the Core Stage; and completed construction of Exploration Ground Systems (EGS) Pad B.
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>NASA is developing&amp;nbsp;key elements of the Nation’s first human deep-space exploration capability in the form of the Space Launch System (SLS) and the Orion crew vehicle. With the support of Exploration Ground Systems (EGS), the SLS and Orion will carry humans farther into space than ever before, and are essential for exploration of deep space, including future human exploration of Mars. Human space exploration inspires the Nation. As the foundation of the human exploration endeavor, these programs are also building a highly skilled workforce. NASA’s human exploration portfolio will advance American leadership in space, and create a path for peace, diplomacy, and global cooperation.

NASA’s first flight of the SLS and the Orion crew vehicle, Exploration Mission (EM)-1, will be an uncrewed mission beyond low Earth orbit with the Orion capsule returning safely to Earth. The EM-1 flight will exercise multiple systems and technical approaches in preparation for a crewed mission. In order to achieve this goal, the SLS launch vehicle, Orion spacecraft, and EGS programs will complete several significant design reviews, as well as test flight and ground hardware and software prior to launch. The successful completion of these milestones, in conjunction with the final assembly and test of the launch vehicle and spacecraft hardware at the Kennedy Space Center launch site, will enable the successful launch of the EM-1 flight. By the end of FY 2017, the SLS, Orion, and EGS programs will be past critical design and into system qualification and major flight hardware production.

For this reporting period, the SLS program will complete a number of significant development, qualification, and production milestones. SLS will complete the second of two qualification tests of the five segment solid rocket motor, the successful completion of which will clear the boosters for flight. Production of core stage (hydrogen and oxygen tanks, intertank, and forward and engine sections) and interim cryogenic propulsion stage qualification hardware will be complete and ready for testing. SLS will also start production of flight hardware, including the launch vehicle stage adaptor and multipurpose crew vehicle stage adaptor. The four RS-25 core stage engines allocated for EM-1 will go through testing in preparation for integration into the EM-1 core and green run testing in FY 2018. Finally, SLS will complete the development of green run and EM-1 flight software.

The Orion Program will complete its Critical Design Review and continue manufacturing and testing of the EM-1 flight vehicle. Manufacturing has already begun on the EM-1 Crew Module’s pressure vessel (the living space within Orion that provides life support for the crew). It will be delivered to the Kennedy Space Center in FY 2016, and then assembly of the Crew Module can begin. This will also be the first flight of the European Service Module, a milestone in the long human spaceflight partnership between NASA and the European Space Agency. The structural testing of the European Service Module will occur in this reporting period. In late FY 2017, the EM-1 Orion crew and service module assembly will undergo environmental testing at Glenn Research Center’s Plum Brook Station in Ohio.

The Exploration Ground Systems program will conduct a Critical Design Review in early FY 2016 to assess the ability of the overall ground systems designs in meeting the mission requirements with acceptable risk and appropriate margins within the defined cost, schedule, and technical constraints. In FY 2016, the program will conduct its System Integration Review. These reviews will be the culmination of several system-level final design and implementation reviews. In late FY 2017, several components of Exploration Ground Systems plan to kick off their respective Operational Readiness Reviews. The system, including any enabling products, will be reviewed and a determination made if it is ready to be placed in an operational status. The kickoff will initiate a process to capture all applicable lessons-learned for organizational improvement and systems operations. All waivers and anomalies will have been in final evaluation and prepared for closure as appropriate. Systems hardware, software, personnel, and procedures will initiate a review to ensure they are in place to support operations. It is anticipated that some additional modifications of the mobile launcher will continue through FY 2017.

</next_steps><progress_update>NASA is managing toward an Exploration Mission (EM)-1 launch no later than November 2018. NASA accomplished both of its fourth quarter FY 2016 milestones, which included completing the Space Launch System (SLS) qualification motor 2 test firing and beginning assembly of the Orion Exploration Mission 1 Crew Module at the Kennedy Space Center, as planned.

The SLS program successfully completed the second of two full-duration hot-fire tests of the full-scale SLS booster qualification motor on June 27, 2016. During the test, 82 qualification test objectives were measured through more than 530 instrumentation channels on the booster at a cold motor conditioning of 40 degrees Fahrenheit – which is the colder end of its accepted propellant temperature range. Preliminary analysis from the test shows the instrumentation performed extremely well and gathered the critical data needed to show that test objectives were met.

During the fourth quarter of FY 2016, Orion made further progress on the assembly of the EM-1 flight Orion. The Crew Module has moved into the “clean room” at the Neil Armstrong Operations and Checkout Building at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, where welding has commenced on the environmental and propulsion tubing. The European Service Module Structural Test Article (E-STA) test team completed the final set of vertical, partially-filled tank configuration vibration tests in the Mechanical Vibration Facility at the NASA Glenn Research Center’s Plum Brook Station in Sandusky, Ohio. For the Service Module, the primary structure was delivered from Torino, Italy, to Bremen, Germany, to begin its own assembly phase, and general bracket installation, harness integration, and propulsion piping has started. U.S. components of the Service Module, such as the Crew Module adapter, made progress as well. For example, Orion technicians have started the installation process of the aft composite structure walls. Other development and qualification testing underway in the fourth quarter included conclusion of landing tests (10 total in the test campaign) at the NASA Langley Research Center in Virginia.

In July 2016, Exploration Ground Systems completed the installation of the fifth of ten planned new work platforms for the SLS rocket inside the Vehicle Assembly Building at the Kennedy Space Center, reaching the halfway point for the installation of the new platforms. Each of the platforms weighs between 300,000 and 325,000 pounds, and they measure about 38 feet long and close to 62 feet wide. Prior to rolling out to Launch Pad 39B, the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft will be brought together in the Vehicle Assembly Building for processing and assembly. Exploration Ground Systems is also refurbishing Launch Pad 39B in order to support EM-1. This includes not only the visible modifications to the surface of the pad and ongoing work in the flame trench, but also upgrades to other systems that may not be as obvious, including a new communication system; new heating, ventilation, and cooling system; replacement of water system piping in the pad perimeter; and installation of a new ignition overpressure/sound suppression bypass valves at the valve complex.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Expanding the frontiers of knowledge, capability, and opportunity in space is an enduring and core goal for NASA. In the past decade alone, we increased our knowledge of the universe as evidenced by the discovery of more than 2,000 planets in other solar systems. Closer to home, we have expanded our exploration capabilities and sent out robotic sentinels to explore our solar system. The Curiosity rover landed more than 225 million kilometers from Earth and is actively exploring Mars. It has already accomplished its major science goal, discovering a location that could have supported microbial life in the past. We are planning to deepen our knowledge of the working of the interior of planetary bodies by placing a highly sensitive seismometer and associated geophysical instruments on the surface of Mars with the InSight mission. In 2020, we will continue our robotic exploration of Mars with a rover largely built upon the successful Curiosity rover and equipped with new, advanced instruments for in situ studies. It will prepare a scientifically selected cache of Mars samples that may be returned to Earth in the future for detailed analysis seeking possible signs of ancient life.
We are undertaking the detailed examination of near-Earth asteroids to determine what they can tell us about the early solar system, and whether any of these objects pose a threat to Earth. We are expanding our Near Earth Object Observation program, to find candidates for the proposed asteroid mission, and to catalogue asteroids larger than 140 meters across. Specifically, NASA will seek to increase the number of asteroid observations by the amateur astronomer community as a part of the Asteroid Grand Challenge. In 2016, we will launch the OSIRIS-REx mission to robotically approach and return a sample from a carbonaceous asteroid. This will aid in our investigation of planet formation and the origin of life in our solar system, as well as our understanding of asteroids that could impact Earth.
The missions we pursue under this goal help address national challenges and are allowing us to take advantage of unique opportunities to bring benefits to the Nation. For example:

• We are moving forward with critical research and technology demonstrations on the ISS.

Great advances in understanding human health have come from research on the ISS, which
can help prepare us for long-duration space travel, as well as improve the quality of life for aging populations on Earth.

• We are contributing to healthy, cutting-edge manufacturing and aerospace sectors.

For SLS, we are using 3D manufacturing technology to print custom parts for the system, marking a revolution in manufacturing.

• We are enabling a robust commercial space industry.

We are leveraging our public-private partnerships to lower launch costs and create more opportunities for commercial space flight.

• We are adding to the scientific understanding that may be needed to protect Earth.

Our proposed asteroid initiative, comprised of both a bold new mission to an asteroid and a global grand challenge to find all asteroid threats to human populations, will help identify the threats posed by some asteroids as well as teach us how to possibly avoid future impacts.

• We are moving outward, beyond low Earth orbit, into the broader solar system.

We are developing SLS and the Orion to carry astronauts farther into space than humans have ever been.

</objective_statement><objective_overview>Over the next decades, NASA intends to erase the boundaries to human exploration of space. We want to open new frontiers beyond low Earth orbit to humankind. NASA is expanding human exploration by developing the capability to transport humans to and from deep space, enabling the exploration of other planets and asteroids within our solar system using innovative, advanced technologies.
As a starting point, exploring deep space requires the capability to transport cargo and crew beyond low Earth orbit, or farther than 2,000 kilometers beyond Earth. NASA is developing a new transportation system that includes a crew capsule, a heavy-lift launch vehicle, and supporting ground facilities and systems.
NASA is developing technologies to enable the additional capabilities that will be required the farther away from Earth we travel. These include the capabilities for in-space propulsion, in-space operations, long-duration habitation, and other systems to support humans in hostile environments. Precursor robotics, robotic missions that investigate candidate destinations and provide vital information to prepare for human explorers, will lay the groundwork for humans to achieve new milestones in deep space.
The capability to transport humans to and from deep space will leverage incremental development of exploration capabilities that seed future discoveries and innovation, and eventually lead to creation of a permanent, long-term human space presence in the solar system. Our exploration of deep space will reward us with new knowledge. While new knowledge increases our understanding of our planet, our solar system, our universe, and ourselves, Americans expect tangible benefits and applications that we can use on Earth. If the past is prologue, scientists and entrepreneurs will generate new uses for the knowledge and technology resulting from NASA’s investments in exploration systems, and this in turn will grow the U.S. economy.
