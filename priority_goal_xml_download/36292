By September 30, 2017, the Commercial Crew Program (CCP), along with its industry partners, will make measurable technical and programmatic progress toward the certification of commercial crew transportation systems, including the completion of at least one Design Certification Review.

&amp;nbsp;
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>The Commercial Crew Program is helping facilitate the development of U.S. commercial crew space transportation capabilities with the goal of achieving safe, reliable, and cost-effective access to and from low Earth orbit and the International Space Station (ISS). Enabling a U.S. industry-based capability can facilitate development of a commercial market, providing new high-technology jobs and reducing the cost of human access to space. A successful commercial market will further open the frontier for space exploration. NASA will continue to work with The Boeing Company and Space Explorations Technologies Corporation to complete development and NASA certification for human space transportation systems capable of carrying people into orbit.

Once certification is completed, NASA plans to use these systems to ferry astronauts to the ISS and return them safely to Earth.

</next_steps><progress_update>The Boeing Company (Boeing) and Space Explorations Technologies Corporation (SpaceX) continue making technical and programmatic progress under their respective Commercial Crew Transportation Capability contracts.


	Both Boeing and SpaceX continue to define requirements closure plans, identify and update hazard reports, and work with NASA to process variances and alternate standards.
	Boeing completed its Government Equipment Test Readiness Review milestone.
	Boeing is making progress toward conducting its initial Integrated Parachute Drop Test milestone, currently planned for October 2016.
	SpaceX completed its integrated transportation system delta Critical Design Review (dCDR) milestone.
	Both partners are transitioning from a design focus to qualification and flight hardware fabrication.

</progress_update><themes><theme>General Science, Space, and Technology</theme></themes><contributing_programs_and_other_factors>Within NASA, the Commercial Crew Program is the principal contributor to the goal. The Commercial Crew Program facilitates the development of safe, reliable, and cost-effective human space transportation by the U.S. commercial industry to and from low Earth orbit and the International Space Station (ISS). The ISS Program also contributes to the goal through the development and maintenance of the transportation service, interface, and safety requirements associated with crewed flights to and from the ISS.

External to NASA, major contributors include the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Office of Commercial Space Transportation, which ensures that commercially-developed, human-rated transportation systems meet FAA licensing requirements for launch and entry, and works with NASA on cross-agency licensing issues; and the United States Air Force, 45th Space Wing, which addresses launch range safety and crew rescue.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Expanding the frontiers of knowledge, capability, and opportunity in space is an enduring and core goal for NASA. In the past decade alone, we increased our knowledge of the universe as evidenced by the discovery of more than 2,000 planets in other solar systems. Closer to home, we have expanded our exploration capabilities and sent out robotic sentinels to explore our solar system. The Curiosity rover landed more than 225 million kilometers from Earth and is actively exploring Mars. It has already accomplished its major science goal, discovering a location that could have supported microbial life in the past. We are planning to deepen our knowledge of the working of the interior of planetary bodies by placing a highly sensitive seismometer and associated geophysical instruments on the surface of Mars with the InSight mission. In 2020, we will continue our robotic exploration of Mars with a rover largely built upon the successful Curiosity rover and equipped with new, advanced instruments for in situ studies. It will prepare a scientifically selected cache of Mars samples that may be returned to Earth in the future for detailed analysis seeking possible signs of ancient life.
We are undertaking the detailed examination of near-Earth asteroids to determine what they can tell us about the early solar system, and whether any of these objects pose a threat to Earth. We are expanding our Near Earth Object Observation program, to find candidates for the proposed asteroid mission, and to catalogue asteroids larger than 140 meters across. Specifically, NASA will seek to increase the number of asteroid observations by the amateur astronomer community as a part of the Asteroid Grand Challenge. In 2016, we will launch the OSIRIS-REx mission to robotically approach and return a sample from a carbonaceous asteroid. This will aid in our investigation of planet formation and the origin of life in our solar system, as well as our understanding of asteroids that could impact Earth.
The missions we pursue under this goal help address national challenges and are allowing us to take advantage of unique opportunities to bring benefits to the Nation. For example:

• We are moving forward with critical research and technology demonstrations on the ISS.

Great advances in understanding human health have come from research on the ISS, which
can help prepare us for long-duration space travel, as well as improve the quality of life for aging populations on Earth.

• We are contributing to healthy, cutting-edge manufacturing and aerospace sectors.

For SLS, we are using 3D manufacturing technology to print custom parts for the system, marking a revolution in manufacturing.

• We are enabling a robust commercial space industry.

We are leveraging our public-private partnerships to lower launch costs and create more opportunities for commercial space flight.

• We are adding to the scientific understanding that may be needed to protect Earth.

Our proposed asteroid initiative, comprised of both a bold new mission to an asteroid and a global grand challenge to find all asteroid threats to human populations, will help identify the threats posed by some asteroids as well as teach us how to possibly avoid future impacts.

• We are moving outward, beyond low Earth orbit, into the broader solar system.

We are developing SLS and the Orion to carry astronauts farther into space than humans have ever been.

</objective_statement><objective_overview>Partnerships with American industry to enable U.S. commercial crew transportation to low Earth orbit will stimulate a commercial industry, promote job growth, and expand knowledge, as well as supply the ISS. NASA envisions commercial human spaceflight to low Earth orbit becoming a robust, vibrant, profit-making commercial enterprise with many providers and a wide range of private and public users. Our role in this enterprise is to provide expertise, incentives, and opportunities to the emerging human space flight industry. We will purchase transportation services to meet our International Space Station crew rotation and emergency return obligations. A vibrant, job-creating, profit-making transportation system for humans and cargo to low Earth orbit will significantly contribute to the national economy.
