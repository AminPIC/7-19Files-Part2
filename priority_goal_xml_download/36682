By September 30, 2017, DoD will improve the career readiness of Service members transitioning to civilian life by: 1) ensuring at least 85% of eligible active duty Service members and 85% of eligible reserve component Service members complete the following required transition activities prior to separation from active duty: pre-separation counseling, a Department of Labor employment workshop, and Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits briefings; 2) verifying that at least 85% of eligible active duty Service members and 85% of eligible reserve component Service members meet established Career Readiness Standards or received a warm handover to appropriate partner agencies prior to separation from active duty; 3) accelerating the transition of recovering Service Members into Veteran status by reducing the disability evaluation processing time; and 4) supporting the seamless transition of recovering Service Members by sharing active recovery plans with the VA.
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Problem / Opportunity:

DoD and other critical federal partners are working to ensure that all eligible Service members participate in an effective program of pre-separation planning and education through evidence-based learning.&amp;nbsp; This support is delivered through a new curriculum, Transition GPS (Goals, Plans, Success) within the DoD Transition Assistance Program (TAP).

There are no current Government Accountability Office (GAO) or Inspector General (IG) audits related to Performance Measures 1 and 2.&amp;nbsp; On June 24, 2015, the DoD IG requested that TVPO provide follow-up on comments made in GAO Report-14-144, Transitioning Veterans: Improved Oversight Needed to Enhance Implementation of Transition Assistance Program (GAO Code 131231).&amp;nbsp; In response to this IG request, the following response was provided: The Interagency TAP Evaluation Strategy was created and subsequently approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in May 2014.&amp;nbsp; A written plan describing this strategy was completed in April 2015.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

There are no current Government Accountability Office (GAO) or IG audits related to Performance Measure 3 (IDES) or Performance Measure 4 (WII Active Recovery Plans).

Relationship to Strategic Goal and Objective:
This performance&amp;nbsp; goal supports the Department's mission through the following strategies:
1. DoD Agency Strategic Plan (ASP), Goal #3: Strengthen and Enhance the Health and Effectiveness of the Total Workforce; Strategic Objective 3.1 Service members separating from Active Duty are prepared for the transition to civilian life.
2. Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) Strategic Goal 4: Preserve and Enhance the All-Volunteer Force; Strategic Goal 5: Provide an Agile, Efficient, Comprehensive Enterprise that Responds to the Warfighter and Maintains Public Confidence Strategic Objective 4.1: Provide top-quality physical and psychological care to wounded warriors while reducing growth in overall healthcare costs; Objective 5.6: Provide more effective and efficient Force Readiness Operations Support.
&amp;nbsp;

Key Barriers and Challenges:

Securing Transition Assistance Program (TAP) resources for both the DoD and interagency partners to meet statutory and DoD policy requirements. Achieving full accountability of Service members meeting Veterans Opportunity to Work (VOW) and Congressional Research Service (CRS) compliance, given the variety of systems and data collection methods that must be integrated to verify completion of mandatory pre-separation activities and training. Mission requirements often take priority over transition activities; full integration across the military life cycle requires a cultural shift for both Service members and commanders.

DoD and Veteran’s Affairs (VA) are joint partners in the Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES), and both Departments’ ability to meet IDES’ goals depends on the other’s performance. The IDES process still relies in part on the exchange of paper case files.&amp;nbsp; To increase process efficiency and improve program oversight, DoD is developing a comprehensive electronic case management system that will be interoperable with VA systems.

Mitigation Efforts:
DoD continues to work to identify and resolve the remaining gaps in data collection and transmission of the VOW and CRS compliance rate data to ensure data accuracy and that the DD Forms 2958 are received for all eligible Service members separating from active duty. In June 2015, OSD P&amp;amp;R Business Council approved a streamlined enterprise data collection process that will mitigate some risks to data quality.

DoD is taking steps to accelerate the transition of Wounded, Ill, and Injured Service Members into Veteran status.&amp;nbsp; The Department is incorporating feedback from Service members and quality assurance reviews of disability determination in addition to monitoring disability processing of timeliness to streamline the IDES process.&amp;nbsp; DoD is also collaborating with VA to eliminate duplicate work, and share medical examination and disability ratings to produce faster, more consistent determinations. To this end, DoD established and IDES performance measure, consisting of the timeliness for specific phases, Service member satisfaction, accuracy and consistency of determinations, and compliance with administrative processing requirements. The DoD will actively monitor and track these elements to ensure the performance targets are met.

Q2 Progress Update

IDES Performance Goal

During Q2 FY2016, 67% of Service member cases met the 105-day (Active component) or 125-day (Reserve component) timeliness target for DoD core IDES processes; 91% of survey responses indicated Service members were satisfied with PEBLO customer service; the Military Departments performed at an accuracy and consistency rating of 90% in the adjudication of high-interest disability policy issues; and, MEBs, PEBs, and PEBLOs met 95% of their administrative disability case processing requirements.&amp;nbsp;

The combined average of the timeliness, satisfaction, accuracy and consistency, and administrative case processing components resulted in an overall 86% score for DoD IDES performance, which exceeded the Q2 target (80%).&amp;nbsp; DoD’s goal is to maintain the 80% performance level throughout FY 2016.
