</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>As large numbers of service members and veterans return to the civilian labor force, they are met by an improving but still-challenging labor market. Veterans, service members, and their families still face significant barriers to entering and maintaining meaningful employment. This is especially true for veterans with significant barriers to employment, including those with a service-connected disability, the educationally or economically disadvantaged, and veterans ages 18 - 24, who have experienced historically high unemployment. Veterans' Employment and Training Service (VETS) intensive services, now reported as individualized career services due to the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), include comprehensive&amp;nbsp;and specialized assessments of skill levels and needs, the development of an individual employment plan, group and individual career counseling and planning, and short-term skills development (such as interview and communication skills).

VETS believes that providing individualized career services to veterans leads to better outcomes. This is supported by findings from an initial study (dated January 30, 2015), conducted by the Department's Chief Evaluation Office, analyzing Wagner-Peyser and Jobs for Veterans State Grants (JVSG) data for the time period of January 2011 to March 2013. Data analysis from the study indicated the following:


	JVSG veterans, compared to non-JVSG veterans and non-veterans, exhibited the highest employment rates, highest earnings, and quickest time-to-first staff-assisted service.
	JVSG veterans have smaller gender earnings gaps and smaller military-separation-time earnings gaps.

VETS leadership will continue to meet with targeted states that have relatively high numbers of veteran participants and relatively low rates of individualized career services to: conduct audits to ensure proper roles and responsibilities are being performed by JVSG staff; provide technical assistance and training, including the implementation of WIOA, corrective actions or provide expertise in meeting the goal; and review quarterly reports to identify outliers who continue to struggle in reaching the 90 percent target.
</next_steps><progress_update>In June 2016, the Department of Labor (DOL) and federal partner agencies released The WIOA Final Rule for the implementation of WIOA.&amp;nbsp;The statutory provisions for WIOA performance accountability and reporting became effective July 1, 2016.&amp;nbsp;VETS has worked closely with our workforce and education partners to ensure that JVSG performance was considered in all stages of this transition. With the implementation of WIOA, intensive services will continue to be provided to veterans with significant barriers to employment; however, it will now be tracked and reported as “individualized career services”.&amp;nbsp;Additionally, WIOA altered the common measure of “entered employment rate in the first quarter after exit” to “employed in the second quarter after exit”.&amp;nbsp;As such, VETS will no longer report “entered employment after receiving intensive services” and will instead report the “rate of participants receiving individualized career services who were employed in the second quarter after exit”.&amp;nbsp;DOL’s Employment and Training Administration (ETA) developed a new online reporting system for states and grantees to collect and report their WIOA data called the WIOA Integrated Performance System (WIPS), which became operational on October 1, 2016.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;Results for the individualized career service rate for the period ending September 30, 2016 are not yet available due to states still updating/revising their case management systems.&amp;nbsp;VETS continues to employ strategies begun in FY 2014&amp;nbsp;to improve services. To support persistent increases in individualized career services, VETS continues to offer technical assistance to grantees, including desktop monitoring of data, site visits, and annual audits.

The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) is responsible for providing opportunity for workers and job seekers to attain the skills and training they need to succeed in a recovering economy. DOL’s Veterans’ Employment and Training Service (VETS) provides training and transition programs that increase the opportunity of veterans to transition successfully to a civilian workforce. The agency works collaboratively with ETA to ensure veterans receive enhanced services at one of the 2,600 American Jobs Centers around the country, and undertakes a series of programs specifically designed to meet the needs of veterans transitioning to the civilian workforce. In addition, VETS protects the employment and reemployment rights of service members under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA).
