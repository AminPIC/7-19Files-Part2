An increase of 25 million represents a 35 percent increase over FY 2014 volume (most recent full year data). This increase will result in a total of 112 million online transactions in FY 2016 and 137 million in FY 2017.
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>As the number of customers signing up for my Social Security and using eServices grows, and as the public's service expectations evolve, we have an opportunity and responsibility to offer the public a broader range of services via the Internet. We will prioritize our work efforts to ensure that our customers can access essential Social Security services whenever they want; wherever they want.

We will improve options for online customers by providing additional online services and improving existing services. These services allow our agency to provide essential information and services around the clock to those members of the public who prefer to conduct business online, allowing our frontline employees to spend more time with customers who need more personal assistance. This will provide an overall higher quality of service to our customers and moves us closer to our goal of a superior customer experience.

We are committed to providing secure and easy to use online services. In FY 2014, customers conducted almost 71 million transactions online, a 42.5 percent increase over FY 2010, when customers conducted almost 13.5 million transactions online. Developing online services for a population with a variety of experiences and comfort levels with technology presents a unique challenge. We solicit input using a variety of methods prior to developing our services. Usability testing, focus groups, and advocacy discussions are common tools we use to engage our external stakeholders. We also consult with our employees when developing online services. Once we implement new online services, we continue to engage the public by soliciting their feedback using online customer satisfaction surveys that are applied across the Federal and private sectors to measure public satisfaction with various website features. In addition to online feedback, we also use internal survey mechanisms&amp;nbsp; to improve our online services. These tools provide us with standard, statistical measurements of public satisafction, and we use this information to guide decision-making for future improvements.

Important influencing factors for this goal are information security and ease of use.&amp;nbsp; Executive Order (EO) 13681, Improving the Security of Consumer Financial Transactions, has established requirements that will increase security but may have an adverse impact on ease of use.&amp;nbsp; As of July 2, 2015, OMB had not published guidance for the EO, but implementation of a second factor, regardless of the guidance, will require additional steps in both the registration process and for each login.&amp;nbsp; The additional complexity might reduce usage

FY 2016 Performance

&amp;nbsp;

In FY 2016, customers conducted over 121,925,134&amp;nbsp;online transactions, which, was 8% over the goal of 121.1 million online transactions. During&amp;nbsp;fourth quarter&amp;nbsp;of FY 2016, customers conducted 33.9 million transactions online. This was a 17% increase over the third quarter goal of 29 million transactions. We continue to expand and enhance our communication channels, allowing customers to complete their online-transactions within the method they prefer.&amp;nbsp;The Message Center's (MC) first release occurred on July 24, 2016.&amp;nbsp; This release focused on the ability to send promotional and informational messages, such as office closings and new eServices, to all my&amp;nbsp;Social&amp;nbsp;Security customers.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Also included in the first release, was the ability to alert my&amp;nbsp;Social&amp;nbsp;Security users by way of email or text message, when a new message or alert had been added to their MC inbox.&amp;nbsp; Once inside their MC, customers also have the ability to save, print, delete and organize their messages by way of folders.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

In FY 2017, we will add additional functionality to the Message Center. These enhancements will allow for targeted messages to be tailored to specific my&amp;nbsp;Social&amp;nbsp;Security customers.&amp;nbsp; The agency will have the ability to send messages to specific areas or even specific demographics.&amp;nbsp;In the future, MC will allow for secure communication between my&amp;nbsp;Social&amp;nbsp;Security customers and SSA technicians and will&amp;nbsp; be the communication hub for the electronic delivery of SSA and DDS related notices.&amp;nbsp;

The SSA Express Icon provides non-SSA locations access to SSA's eServices in an easy to use format.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In FY 2016, we added 476 new Icon partners, bringing the total to 780 partners across the US.&amp;nbsp; During FY16 we added SSA Express to various veteran and state facilities, such as: Western AZ Council of Governments in Arizona, Veterans Awareness Center in Delaware, Veterans Administration Community Resource and Referral Centers in Iowa, Sussex County Health and Human Services in Delaware, and the Department of Welfare and Supportive Service in Nevada.

FY 2017 Strategic Marketing Plan is in final review and first quarter activities have been approved and under development.&amp;nbsp;As previously shared during past quarterly updates, the final Customer Service Station (CSS) was added in January 2015.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There are seven CSSs with one in&amp;nbsp;a field office and &amp;nbsp;the other six&amp;nbsp;are at third party non-SSA locations.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We do not plan to add any more CSSs during the proof of concept (POC) phase, which is scheduled to end in December 2016.&amp;nbsp; The CSS POC was originally&amp;nbsp;scheduled to end&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;second quarter&amp;nbsp;FY 2016, but was extended for one year.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Despite technical issues with the POC CSSs, site feedback supports this business need. &amp;nbsp;Customer satisfaction is currently at 97%, and 72% of our users said that they would prefer to conduct future SSA business on a CSS instead of visiting a field office or calling the National 800 Number (N8NN).&amp;nbsp; We also learned that CSSs can provide SSA services to our customers in a convenient location.&amp;nbsp; We are confident that&amp;nbsp; with more reliable&amp;nbsp;technology and a robust maintenance plan, we can effectively market CSS as an alternate means of providing service delivery.&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

FY 2016 Quarterly Milestones&amp;nbsp;

Q4 - In order to increase availability of our services to the public, we will expand the number of SSA Express Self-Help PCs in SSA Field Offices and Desktop Icons at external partner locations.

&amp;nbsp;


	
	Desktop Icon - We continue to increase external partnerships. We expanded to approximately 50 new Icon locations in the fourth quarter, bringing the national total to more than 780 partner sites.&amp;nbsp; Throughout the year, we added the Icon to various veteran and state facilities, such as: Western AZ Council of Governments in Arizona, Veterans Awareness Center in Delaware, Veterans Administration Community Resource and Referral Centers in Iowa, Sussex County Health and Human Services in Delaware, and the Department of Welfare and Supportive Service in Nevada.
	


&amp;nbsp;


	
	&amp;nbsp;During FY 2016, we were unable to add any Self-Help PCs (SHPCs) due to funding and expiration of the BPA in March 2016. &amp;nbsp;The new BPA is not expected to be available again until sometime after November 2016. &amp;nbsp;We asked for a risk-based amount of 130 SHPCs for FY 2017.
	


Q3&amp;nbsp;- In order to enhance security, we will implement changes in support of Executive Order 13681, Improving the Security of Consumer Financial Transactions&amp;nbsp;


	&amp;nbsp;In FY 2016, we have successfully completed user acceptance testing and are 99% complete with validation.&amp;nbsp; We will continue to collaboratively work with stakeholders on implementation.&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;

Q2 - In order to increase the public's awareness of online services, we will complete preparation, and begin implementation, of a strategic marketing plan for online services


	During the second quarter of FY 2016, we conducted outreach and participated in various events where we promoted our agency's online services. SSA is scheduled to launch several marketing plans and targeted campaigns in FY16 to promote our online services.&amp;nbsp; These include:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
	
		
		Launched the iSSNRC marketing activities on January 25, 2016;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
		
		
		Partnered with Federal, State, Local, and advocate partners to market the internet SSN replacement card behind the my Social Security;&amp;nbsp;
		
		
		Utilized various communications channels, including social media to market the internet SSN replacement card behind the my Social Security portal; and&amp;nbsp;
		
		
		SSA has finalized the recompete of the agency's marketing contract.&amp;nbsp; As a result of the appeal, and the time and budgeting constraints involved during an appeal, OCOMM's ability to fund external marketing activities has been limited.&amp;nbsp; Now that the contract is awarded, we will resume a wide variety of proactive, paid marketing activities to help reach this APG.
		
	
	


&amp;nbsp;

Q2 - In order to enhance services available to the public, we will enhance the my&amp;nbsp;Social&amp;nbsp;Security portal by releasing an Application Status service, allowing claimants to check the status of their pending benefit application


	We reported last quarter that this project is now scheduled for a&amp;nbsp;fourth quarter&amp;nbsp;implementation.&amp;nbsp; However, due to the complexity of interpreting and incorporating data provided from the many programmatic data stores involved, we are currently revisiting the schedule for potential adjustments.&amp;nbsp; This enhancement will likely be delayed until the first quarter of FY 2017.


&amp;nbsp;

Q1 - In order to expand the services offered through the my&amp;nbsp;Social&amp;nbsp;Security portal, we will release the Social Security Replacement Card application.&amp;nbsp; This initial release will allow some citizens to request replacement cards online


	iSSNRC was successfully released on November 28th, 2015 with State ID verification for Washington and Wisconsin.&amp;nbsp; On December 12th, it was expanded to include State ID verification from Michigan, Nebraska, and the District of Columbia.&amp;nbsp; We are monitoring the application performance, operational&amp;nbsp; impacts, and for possible suspicious activity.&amp;nbsp; Further expansion is planned later in this fiscal year.
