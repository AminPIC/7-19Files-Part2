Customer choice of where and how they receive service is important. Wage earners, retirees, survivors, and individuals with disabilities and their loved ones come to our agency seeking immediate assistance, care, and help. Other customers, including employers, businesses, non-profits, advocates, oversight groups and other stakeholders, also require our attention and support.    	We have a long history of exemplary customer service with high customer satisfaction ratings.&amp;nbsp; In surveys and anecdotally through social media and other forums, many of our customers have praised the service we provide.&amp;nbsp; Our goal is to achieve even greater success in customer service and satisfaction through innovative online self-service options.    	The strategies and milestones in this plan are designed to ensure our customers are highly satisfied, and that we solicit and incorporate feedback from our customers to improve customer satisfaction.  </APG_Overview><Goal_Leaders><Goal_Leader><goal_leader_name> Nancy Berryhill</goal_leader_name><goal_leader_title>Deputy Commissioner</goal_leader_title><goal_leader_org>Office of Operations</goal_leader_org></Goal_Leader><Goal_Leader><goal_leader_name> Michelle King</goal_leader_name><goal_leader_title>Acting Deputy Commissioner</goal_leader_title><goal_leader_org>Office of Budget, Finance, Quality, and Management</goal_leader_org></Goal_Leader></Goal_Leaders><next_steps> 	FY 2017 Quarterly Milestones    	     	 Q1&amp;nbsp;- Conduct a review of customer feedback from two of the eight internet services included in ForeSee E-Government Satisfaction Index, and take appropriate actions to increase customer satisfaction.

Online service satisfaction rating comes from ForeSee's e-Government report card.&amp;nbsp; The Customer Satisfaction rating is calculated by averaging the scores of our eight online services.&amp;nbsp; All eight online service scores are equally weighted in determining the overall average.     	      	The Overall SSA Customer Satisfaction Score for fourth quarter&amp;nbsp;FY 2016 was 84.1.&amp;nbsp; The FY 2016 FYTD score was 84.9, which exceeds the FY 2016 goal of 84.5.     	     	For FY 2016 fiscal year to date, five of the eight online applications continue to score an 85 or above and seven applications exceeded the ForeSee Customer Satisfaction Excellence threshold with scores of 80 or higher.&amp;nbsp; While Business Services Online increased by one point, Extra Help with Medicare Prescription Costs, iClaim and my Social Security continue to maintain their Q3 scores.&amp;nbsp; Retirement Estimator, Disability and iAppeals dropped by one point.&amp;nbsp;

However, the page took a dive to 63 in August because of the release (and subsequent rollback) of multifactor authentication.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Following the rollback, Main Page scores returned to low 70's, ending FY 2016 with a score of 70.&amp;nbsp;     	&amp;nbsp;     	Customer Satisfaction with Office and Telephone Services has&amp;nbsp;a preliminary overall score of 80%, which meets the FY 2016 target.&amp;nbsp; The scores for All Telephone Contacts was 75% Excellent, Very Good, Good (E/VG/G), and for All Office Visitors was 90% E/VG/G.&amp;nbsp;

    	As of the fourth quarter, we have completed Satisfaction Inquiry Reviews (SIRs) for all of our online applications.&amp;nbsp; We inventoried the findings and recommendations for each SIR, and are currently analyzing the recommendations for cross-application impact to identify improvements for inclusion in FY 2017 or FY 2018. &amp;nbsp; During FY 2016, we worked to identify additional improvements from the survey results outside of the ForeSee SIR recommendations.&amp;nbsp; We will continue to review these recommendations to determine if they can be included in either FY 2017 or FY 2018. &amp;nbsp; According to our National 800 Number Network fourth quarter Post-Call Survey Results, 75% of our customers are Satisfied or Very Satisfied.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Based on survey results,&amp;nbsp;we conducted informational sessions with the regions on how to use Post-Call Survey and related data to tailor agent specific training.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We also added two new questions in&amp;nbsp;the fourth quarter to determine the service provided by National 800 Number Network Customer Service&amp;nbsp;Employees.&amp;nbsp;     	      	For fourth quarter of FY 2016, 89% of all visitors to the 14 Social Security Card Centers rated SSA with a Very Positive or Positive rating. For all of FY 2016, 89% of all visitors to the 14 Social Security Card Centers rated SSA with a Very Positive or Positive rating.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;     	     	FY 2016 Fourth Quarter Milestones     	&amp;nbsp;Q4 - Conduct a review of customer feedback from the remaining two internet services included in the ForeSee E-Government Satisfaction Index&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;     	&amp;nbsp;We conducted Extra Help with Medicare Prescription Costs and SSA Main pages SIRs.&amp;nbsp;We are currently analyzing the customer feedback and recommendations to identify improvements for inclusion in FY 2017 or FY 2018.     	&amp;nbsp;     	Q4 - Report Satisfaction Rate for Field Office Caller Survey and Social Security Card Center Visitor Survey.     	&amp;nbsp;The FY 2016 overall satisfaction rating from field office callers was 78% excellent, very good, or good (E/VG/G).&amp;nbsp; The FY 2016 overall satisfaction rating from social security card center visitors was 92% &amp;nbsp;E/VG/G.&amp;nbsp;     	      	Q4 - Report results of Post-Call Surveys for customers of our National 800 Number and take appropriate actions.     	Based on analysis throughout the fiscal year, two questions pertaining to service our employees provide were added and several questions that showed consistent results over a prolonged period were removed.&amp;nbsp; We shared information with our regions to assist them in planning supplemental and refresher training for employees, as needed.&amp;nbsp;     	&amp;nbsp;    	Q3 - Conduct a review of customer feedback from two of the remaining four internet services included in the ForeSee E-Government Satisfaction Index, and take appropriate actions to increase customer satisfaction.     	The&amp;nbsp;iClaim and iClaim-Disability Satisfaction Inquiry Requests (SIRs) were conducted in the third quarter of FY 2016.&amp;nbsp; The iClaim analysis found that users are confused when applying for Medicare Parts A and B.&amp;nbsp; To assist our users, we are exploring additional ways of providing general Medicare information as well as links to Medicare.gov to ensure clarity and ease of the application process. Based on&amp;nbsp;the analysis of&amp;nbsp;iClaim-Disability we have decided to improve&amp;nbsp;a future release by allowing the claimant to retrieve information by signing into their my Social Security account.     	We will continue to find ways to improve the overall customer satisfaction experience with each new release of the online applications.     	&amp;nbsp;     	Q3 -&amp;nbsp; Report Satisfaction Rate for 800 Number Caller Survey     	The FY 2016 overall satisfaction rating from 800 number callers was 72% excellent, very good, or good (E/VG/G), which is an improvement from 71% in FY 2015.     	     	Q3&amp;nbsp;- Evaluation of data from the Federal Feedback Button Pilot and take appropriate action     	Social Security Administration's Analytics Center of Excellence&amp;nbsp;conducted some initial analysis with regards to Feedback USA from 8/3/2015 - 7/19/2016. We are currently evaluating the results.     	      	Q2&amp;nbsp;- Conduct a review of customer feedback from two of the remaining six internet services included in the ForeSee E-Government Satisfaction Index, and take appropriate actions to increase customer satisfaction.     	The my Social Security and iAppeals Satisfaction Inquiry Requests (SIRs) were conducted in the second quarter of FY 2016. We received valuable information and recommendations for both applications, which will be analyzed and evaluated for inclusion in FY 2017 project planning.     	iAppeals made improvements providing clarity and ease to the online application questions in March 2015 that made a significant contribution to greatly enhance customer satisfaction scores from May through the end of FY 2015(76 to 81). Those scores have continued into the second quarter FY 2016.     	We continue to monitor applications and their results to identify target areas for future enhancements. Additionally, we hold regular meetings with ForeSee representatives to discuss application performance and evaluate goals.     	&amp;nbsp;     	Q2&amp;nbsp;- Report Satisfaction Rate for Field and Hearing Office Visitor Survey.     	&amp;nbsp;The FY 2016 overall satisfaction rating from field office visitors was 90% excellent, very good, or good (E/VG/G). The FY 2016 overall satisfaction rating from hearing office visitors was 91% excellent, very good, or good (E/VG/G).     	&amp;nbsp;    	Q1&amp;nbsp;- Conduct a review of customer feedback from two of the eight internet services included in the ForeSee E-Government Satisfaction Index, and take appropriate actions to increase customer satisfaction.     	The Retirement Estimator and Business Services Online Satisfaction Insight Reviews (SIRS) were conducted in the first quarter of FY 2016. Although we received valuable recommendations for both applications, budgetary constraints in FY 2016 prohibit the inclusion of these recommendations for FY 2016 implementation. We will revisit these recommendations in preparation for the FY 2017 budget.     	&amp;nbsp;     	Q1&amp;nbsp;- Evaluate effectiveness of dynamic help and 'click-to-callback' technology implemented late FY 2015.     	Customers using the Get Help (dynamic help) and Click-to-Callback features are satisfied with the service they receive. More than half (58%) of customers using the Get Help button found it helpful. The Call Back button is even more successful, with 76% of customers finding it helpful.     	     	Q1&amp;nbsp;- Review results of analyses from the past 12 months of ForeSee surveys to identify additional actions for implementation.     	In the first quarter of FY 2016, the FY 2015 ForeSee survey reviews were analyzed and the recommendations were categorized. Individual and overall issues are becoming apparent but conclusive results are not yet available. We are about 75% completed with the review process and will complete it before the end of the second quarter.Q3 - Conduct a review of customer feedback from two of the remaining four internet services included in the ForeSee E-Government Satisfaction Index, and take appropriate actions to increase customer satisfaction.Q3 - Conduct a review of customer feedback from two of the remaining four internet services included in the ForeSee E-Government Satisfaction Index, and take appropriate actions to increase customer satisfaction.&amp;nbsp;     	&amp;nbsp;    	      	&amp;nbsp;    	    </progress_update><themes><theme>Social Security</theme></themes><contributing_programs_and_other_factors>Important influencing factors for this goal are information security and ease of use.&amp;nbsp; Executive Order (EO) 13681, 'Improving the Security of Consumer Financial Transactions,' has established requirements that will increase security but may have an adverse impact on ease of use.&amp;nbsp; As of July 8, 2015, OMB had not published guidance for the EO, but implementation of a second factor, regardless of the guidance, will require additional steps in both the registration process and for each login.&amp;nbsp; While the additional security could have a positive impact on customer satisfaction, the additional complexity in the registration and login processes might have the opposite impact.</contributing_programs_and_other_factors></Agency_Priority_Goal><Strategic_Goals></Strategic_Goals><Strategic_Objectives></Strategic_Objectives><Indicators></Indicators></data>
