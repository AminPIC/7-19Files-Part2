</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>At any given time, about one in every 25 hospitalized patients has a healthcare-associated infection while over 1 million HAIs occur across the U.S. healthcare system every year. These infections can lead to significant morbidity and mortality, with tens of thousands of lives lost each year.

Of these hospital-acquired events, catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) are among the most common. Research has shown that a significant portion of these infections can be prevented, avoiding patient morbidity and mortality from this HAI while reducing costs accrued to the healthcare system.

The HAI Agency Priority Goal is to reduce the national rate of HAI by demonstrating significant, quantitative and measurable reductions in hospital-acquired CAUTI. As such; the FY2014-15 HAI Agency Priority Goal (APG) is to reduce the national CAUTI standardized infection ratio by 10% by September 2015 over the current 2012 baseline of 1.03. Of note, this SIR baseline was&amp;nbsp;changed from 1.02 to 1.03 in this goal. This reflects the fact that the CDC released preliminary final numbers for 2012 in September 2013, the time at which this goal was written. However, hospitals still had through the end of the year to report final data to NHSN. Accounting for the last three months of data submitted by some hospitals caused a slight adjustment in the final (and thus baseline) 2012 SIR from 1.02 to 1.03. We make this adjustment in the HAI.APG to reflect the finalized SIR and to maintain consistency with other HAI reports moving forward.

As we carry this portion of the goal from the FY2011-13 goal, a concerted effort between the Centers for Medicare&amp;nbsp;and Medicaid Services (CMS), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Office of the Assistant Secretary of Health (OASH) will continue to be a crucial to meeting goal targets. The main US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) operating divisions that constitute this workgroup will focus on applying their HAI programmatic efforts in a way that aligns strategy and metrics, provides consistent messaging to its audience, uses data to target those facilities in most need of improvement, and creates synergy to achieve CAUTI reduction outcomes.

We will continue to use combined HHS programmatic levers to contribute to the achievement of CAUTI targets. These initiatives include:


	Quality Improvement Organization (QIOs) Program
	Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting (HIQR) Program
	Disseminating Data for Action using the &amp;nbsp;National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN)
	State HAI programs
	Partnership for Patients (PfP)
	Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program (CUSP) for CAUTI Ongoing coordination through HAI strategic planning, HAI Regional and National Meetings
	Regular review and updates to the National Action Plan to prevent HAIs: &quot;Roadmap to Elimination.&quot;


Attention to several factors&amp;nbsp;are necessary to assess progress toward goals in this new&amp;nbsp;period. As in the previous HAI goal and consistent with a measurement strategy used by&amp;nbsp;a majority of hospitals that participate in national HAI reporting initiatives, this goal will use the standardized infection ratio (SIR) as the measure, NHSN, the CDC-run infection surveillance system as the primary data source and report data points on &amp;nbsp;a biannual basis. A six month lag in data will remain in order to ensure the most complete and accurate data being reported out and minimize statistically insignificant variations in the data.

Lessons learned from the previous goal allow us to predict potential changes in the CAUTI SIR trend in the months following January 2015 now that CMS' Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting (HIQR) &amp;nbsp;program requires participating hospitals to report CAUTI in non-intensive care units to receive their full annual payment update. The influx of new CAUTI reporters in the middle of the previous 2011-13 HAI.APG was identified as one but not the sole, etiology behind an increase in the CAUTI SIR over the life of this goal. The differences in CAUTI SIRs in ICU and non-ICU settings along with the influx of new reporters among non-ICU locations in 2015 may impact this goal. The degree to which this could again be a factor again is unknown especially since through programmatic outreach, many hospitals already report non-ICU CAUTI data to NHSN voluntarily.

We also anticipate application of the new CAUTI definition, which went into effect January 1, 2015, to the APG data we will report in subsequent quarters. Because our baseline CAUTI SIR was calculated using the old CAUTI definition, a strategy to ensure continuity and validity of new SIR data across this goal has been established. The CDC will construct a new SIR by applying the new CAUTI definition to our current baseline SIR and data points proceeding January 1, 2015. In other words, we will translate SIR data including our baseline data prior to January 1st&amp;nbsp;to SIR data that is reflective of the changes in the CAUTI definition. We will also be able to illustrate the CAUTI SIR baseline and trending data by applying the new vs the old definition in order to demonstrate the degree of difference or lack thereof resulting from this definitional change. CDC has changed the CAUTI definition in response to input from stakeholders and scientific data.The HAI Workgroup will present full details on the definition change in relation to this goal and our targeted CAUTI SIR reductions to HHS leadership in November of 2015.

Lastly, analysis of the CAUTI data continues to reveal marked difference in reductions between intensive care and non-intensive care units. Intensive care units have significantly higher SIRs, higher number of catheter-days, and show less reductions in these indicators of progress than in the non ICU setting. The difference in CAUTI reductions between ICUs and non-ICU settings have been highlighted in analysis of both NHSN and CUSP for CAUTI data. Given the fact that sicker patients are admitted in ICUs, retaining a urinary catheter for &amp;nbsp;longer may be a rooted in practice necessity or &amp;nbsp;provider belief that it is a necessity and so concentrating on behavioral and systems process change may need to be further emphasized as we &amp;nbsp;work in this setting to reduce CAUTI. The 10% goal for CAUTI reduction in this APG effort represents a composite goal that reflects greater reductions in non-ICU settings and lesser reductions in ICUs. Improvements in CAUTI however, have been demonstrated in large scale improvement programs when actively engaged in embedding evidence-based infection control protocol and a culture of safety unit and facility-wide. It’s also important to note that preliminary projections through the first three quarters of 2015 continue to show a&amp;nbsp;fall in the CAUTI SIR and an on-track trajectory for achieving the CAUTI goal target.

The SOW in support of this next period of performance requires specific emphasis on CAUTI reduction inclusive of a robust plan aimed at decreasing catheter utilization. Tools such as those available from the CDC (CDC NHSN - TAP strategy) as well as in-depth root-cause analysis of contributing factors both in the ICU and other units are proposed by the HENs as mechanisms to continue CAUTI reduction. Coordination with other stakeholders are being developed and shared in an effort to develop ongoing synergy to maximize resources.

Partnership for Patients also examines Medicare Patient Safety Monitoring System (MPSMS) data in addition to NHSN to examine results. The varying definition of CAUTI in MPSMS (based on physician diagnostic elements) and its used of incident rate make it difficult to compare CAUTI NHSN and MPSMS data, however we should note that both sources share a downward trend in CAUTI reductions. A version of the (physician-diagnosed) CAUTI data from MPSMS is on-line as part of the information disseminated so far on data from Partnership for Patients. This can be found on http://www.ahrq.gov/professionals/quality-patient safety/pfp/index.htm.


	In Q4, AHRQ’s nationwide CUSP for CAUTI project reached its conclusion. Project data are being thoroughly analyzed, and final results will be available in December 2015.
	AHRQ previously reported that, as of March, 2015, the project recruited eight cohorts representing 955 hospitals and 1,595 hospital units across forty (40) States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. An additional ninth cohort of ICUs was recruited, and these ICUs&amp;nbsp;implemented CUSP with increased technical assistance and attention to catheter utilization.
	Among the units participating in CUSP for CAUTI, 746 units reached a point 14 months after initiating CUSP implementation and reported data on CAUTI rate reductions at that point.
	Overall, these units achieved a 13.5% relative reduction in CAUTI rates.
	Non-ICUs achieved a 23.4% relative reduction in CAUTI rates, whereas ICUs achieved a 5.9% reduction in CAUTI rates. The CAUTI rate reduction in non-ICUs is greater than in ICUs in part because ICUs have higher rates of catheter utilization than non- ICUs.
	As noted in the Next Steps section below, at the end of FY 2015 AHRQ&amp;nbsp;funded a project that will apply CUSP to reduce persistently elevated CAUTI and CLABSI rates in ICUs. This project is&amp;nbsp;a collaborative effort of AHRQ, CDC, and CMS.
	CMS QIN.QIOs: QIOs completed their active recruitment phase for directed assistance to reduce HAIs, including CAUTI in every state in the nation. A total&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;701 hospitals were recruited specifically for the reduction of CAUTI. The TAP strategy was employed in close collaboration with the CDC by all QIN.QIOs to ensure resources were employed according to data-driven needs for improvement.
	QIN-QIOs entered into active intervention phase to reduce CAUTI in hospitals and progress&amp;nbsp;with respect to targeted goals will be monitored annually.
	Partnership for Patients: (see “Milestone”).
	
	The CDC has led a successful implementation of the TAP program in close partnership with CMS and AHRQ. Specific examples of the use of TAP this quarter include:

	
		
		Distribution of updated CAUTI TAP tools to 78 contacts from all 14 QIN QIOs across 48 states, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. This quarter, CDC has provided these tools to over 20 federal and non-federal partners including individual facilities.
		
		
		Provision of several webinars including individualized webinars at the request of seven QIN QIOs to further educate on TAP implementation, educational guidance and customization of tools for regional and facility-specific needs.
		
	
	
	CDC has started work with the Health Research and Education Trust on a national effort to perform infection control assessments in hospitals which will include specific work on CAUTI prevention.
	OASH: OASH is conducting literature reviews; data collection and analysis in the disparities phase of its “Reducing Racial/Ethnic and Other Disparities in Preventable Adverse Healthcare-Associated Outcomes” a Project which includes prevention and reduction of CAUTIs in these populations.


Next Steps:

Although Reduction of CAUTI in hospitals was not maintained as an HHS Agency Priority Goal, CMS will retain this as a GPRA goal using the same collaborative means and monitoring schedule as is used in the APG format. Taking into account CAUTI definition changes that began in January 2015 and a reset of the NHSN CAUTI SIR baseline to 1.0 in December of 2015, CMS has targeted a 5% reduction in the national hospital-acquired CAUTI SIR by September 2016 and an overall 10% reduction by the end of 2017.

We will continue to use a combination of programmatic levers and evidence-based infection control interventions in order to show substantial reductions in CAUTI.


	CMS’ QIO program - CMS and CDC continue to work together using&amp;nbsp;TAP data to direct hospitals with the greatest numbers of CAUTIs to QIN.QIOs in their regions. This serves as a continued illustration of the data-driven and collaborative principles so heavily a part of this goal.
	An evidence-based abstract, co-authored by both CDC and CMS, &quot;Development of a Catheter-associated Urinary Tract Infection Facility Assessment Tool to Target Prevention&quot; was written and&amp;nbsp;accepted. It will be&amp;nbsp;presented as an oral presentation for ID Week October 7-11, 2015 in San Diego, CA.
	The published abstract is available on&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;Open Forum Infectious Diseases&amp;nbsp;(OFID), the new Open Access Journal from the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA).
	CDC will continue to provide education and technical support to partner organizations engaged in CAUTI prevention such as CMS’ QIO.QINs and HENs as well as in partnership with AHRQ programmatic resources.
	CDC is also exploring the use of a risk-adjusted urinary catheter utilization metric (i.e., standardized utilization ratio) as a potential quality metric to reduce inappropriate urinary catheter use.
	AHRQ: The nationwide CUSP for CAUTI project&amp;nbsp;reached its conclusion in August 2015, and final results regarding CAUTI rate reductions will be available in December 2015.
	An AHRQ-funded project will focus on &amp;nbsp;applying CUSP to reduce persistently elevated CAUTI and CLABSI rates in ICUs. This project, which was funded toward the end of FY 2015, is a follow-up to AHRQ’s nationwide CUSP for CAUTI and CUSP for CLABSI projects. This project is being conducted as a collaboration among AHRQ, CDC, and CMS: AHRQ will provide funding, guidance, and technical assistance to participating units on CUSP intervention; CDC will use NHSN data to identify lower performing ICUs and provide additional technical assistance; and CMS will mobilize QIN.QIOs as intervention agents.
	OASH: Anticipate Secretarial comments on proposed 2020 HAI targets for National Action Plan to Prevent HAIs: Roadmap to Elimination and resumption of regular HHS HAI Steering Committee meeting hosted by OASH.


We continue to examine the etiology behind lack of projected CAUTI reductions. Analysis thus far &amp;nbsp;reveals a need to focus additional efforts in ICU locations, reduce inappropriate urinary catheter use, and target prevention gaps with evidenced-based prevention implementation strategies focus additional efforts in ICU locations, reduce inappropriate urinary catheter use, and target prevention gaps with evidenced-based prevention implementation strategies. In addition, we continue to strengthen learning and action networks and HAI prevention and reduction efforts between our multiple private and public stakeholders. These efforts contribute bi-directional learning, the spread of best practices and optimizing outcomes. Improvements in measurement strategies are actively being addressed in conjunction with the healthcare community including ways to increase clinical objectivity and accuracy of CAUTI reporting. Strategies and methods of changing behavior are needed particularly in ICU settings where CAUTI rates tend to remain higher than in non-ICUs. Work to increase and spread evidence- based practices along with implementation strategies and tools to embed them in facilities is ongoing. Work across transitions of care warrants concerted efforts to make broad scale improvements in this arena.
