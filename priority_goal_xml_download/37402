	Adopting and operationalizing category management as a spend-management strategy is generating data and knowledge that can be shared and supported through the Gateway, leading to mutually improved outcomes. &amp;nbsp;As such all organizations within FAS will be engaged in developing content for the Gateway and providing input for improvement that is incorporated by the Acquisition Gateway Team within FAS.
	&amp;nbsp;
	
	Users of the Gateway are keenly interested in obtaining prices paid data and useful analysis &amp;amp; visualization of that data. The Prices Paid Portal provides that and the Gateway incorporates the information on behalf of our users.
