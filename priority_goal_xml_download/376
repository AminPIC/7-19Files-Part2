</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>During the past 75 years, the federal government has invested billions of dollars in the development and maintenance of affordable publicly- and privately-owned rental housing.&amp;nbsp; Despite this sizable investment, the supply of affordable housing units has not kept up with demand.&amp;nbsp; Some units have been lost because of their deteriorated physical condition; others have been removed from the affordable inventory because of owners’ decisions or because periods of affordability have expired.&amp;nbsp; Some Multifamily Housing programs that subsidized private owners of affordable rental housing either have no option for owners to renew their subsidy contracts with HUD or cannot be renewed on terms that attract sufficient capital to preserve long-term affordability.&amp;nbsp; Moreover, the public housing stock faces an estimated $26&amp;nbsp;billion capital needs backlog, which will be difficult to meet, given federal fiscal constraints.

To enable public housing agencies to address the immediate and longer-term needs of their properties, HUD’s Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) allows public housing agencies and owners of Moderate Rehabilitation, Rent Supplement, and Rental Assistance Payment developments to convert to long-term Section 8 rental assistance contracts, thereby allowing access to private funding sources.

Preservation of an expanded range of HUD-assisted properties will be facilitated by the establishment of a Recapitalization Office that will provide&amp;nbsp;a one-stop shop for owners to handle a variety of complicated preservation transactions.&amp;nbsp; Moreover, HUD’s participation in the White House Rental Policy Working Group has spurred improvements in rental housing across agencies, particularly in the area of unit physical inspections and HUD’s Real Estate Assessment Center’s role.

The incremental actual for FY 2014 was 36,128 units. The FY 2015 incremental actual was 69,923 units compared to the FY 2015 target of 89,196 units. A detailed explanation for this shortfall in rental units is described below.

The Office of Multifamily Housing was 6,024 units short of reaching their FY 2015 incremental target. Housing programs were expected to gain 21,996 units, but ended up adding only 15,972 units; this change is 3.49% of the FY 2013 cumulative baseline for all Multifamily Housing Programs. The majority of the shortfall can be attributed to slower than initially anticipated units converted to Project-Based Rental Assistance (PBRA) in the RAD program.

The Office of Public and Indian Housing missed its FY 2015 target of 56,071 units by 14,462 units. Two of Office of Public and Indian Housing’s biggest programs, Public Housing and Housing Choice Vouchers, set targets of decreasing the number of Public Housing units by 33,065 and increasing the number of utilized vouchers by 73,194 in support of HUD’s RAD initiative. In actuality the number of Public Housing units decreased by 17,750 and the number of Housing Choice Vouchers increased by 53,939. The smaller than targeted decrease in Public Housing units is due in part to slower than expected RAD conversions.

The Office of Community Planning and Development (CPD) exceeded its target of 11,129 units by 1,213 units. This is largely due to better than expected performance in the HOME program. The Tax Credit Assistance Program and Neighborhood Stabilization Programs are retiring which will result in a decrease of rental units from CPD. &amp;nbsp;Community Development Block Grants – Disaster Recovery was 9,311 units short of its 11,832 FY 2015 goal.

Out of HUD’s continuing commitments, meeting the need for quality affordable rental homes remains an Agency Priority Goal again for FY 2016 and FY 2017 with a two-year incremental target of 134,516.

The first component of the RAD allows projects funded under the public housing and Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation (Mod Rehab) programs to convert their assistance to long-term, project-based Section 8 rental assistance contracts. HUD is exercising its discretion to prioritize public housing conversions under the competitive requirements of this component. &amp;nbsp;Targets are cumulative.

This metric is measured using the calendar year to date Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) spending as a percentage of budget authority. &amp;nbsp;PIH works closely with Public Housing Authorities (PHA’s) to identify specific budget utilization, voucher utilization, and limited HAP reserve targets, which will optimize the number of households that a PHA is able to serve given its budget and current reserve level.&amp;nbsp;

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Renters in America face serious difficulty finding affordable housing in a broad range of communities because of the dual problems of a shortage of units in some areas and a lack of income to afford units in the existing market.  Despite the units of housing provided through HUD’s programs, the supply of affordable and available rental housing in America is insufficient.  Moreover, the number of families struggling to make ends meet in the face of severe rent burdens continues to increase.  HUD remains committed to providing rental assistance to poor households within this challenging environment.    
</strategic_goal_overview><strategic_goal_sequence>2</strategic_goal_sequence></Strategic_Goal></Strategic_Goals><Strategic_Objectives><Strategic_Objective><id>1151</id><objective_header>Preserve the long-term availability of quality affordable rental housing, where it is needed most, through HUD’s many rental housing programs.</objective_header><objective_statement>Preserve the long-term availability of quality affordable rental housing, where it is needed most, through HUD’s many rental housing programs.
</objective_statement><objective_overview>During the past 80 years, the federal government has invested billions of dollars in the development and maintenance of affordable public and assisted multifamily housing. Despite the sizable investment and the great demand for such housing, assisted units continue to be lost. Some units have been lost because of their deteriorated physical condition. Others, both publically and privately owned, have been removed from the affordable inventory because of owners’ decisions or because periods of affordability have expired. Some multifamily housing programs either have no option for owners to renew their subsidy contracts with HUD or do not support contract renewal on terms that attract sufficient capital to preserve long-term affordability. Moreover, the public housing stock faces an estimated $26 billion capital needs backlog that will be difficult to meet given federal fiscal constraints.   
Rather than view these trends as an obstacle, HUD is taking advantage of the opportunity to update its housing stock and transition to funding strategies with more long-term viability. All the while, HUD remains committed to providing other decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable options for low-income renters through the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD), tax credits, Choice Neighborhoods, mixed financed public housing development, and other creative programs.
RAD makes it possible for public housing authorities to address capital repair and replacement needs of their properties, preserving these affordable rental units. RAD allows public housing authorities and owners of Moderate Rehabilitation, Rent Supplement, and Rental Assistance Payment developments to convert to long-term Section 8 rental assistance contracts so they can access private funding sources.
