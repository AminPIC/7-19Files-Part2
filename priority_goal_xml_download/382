By September 30, 2015, increase approved capacity authorized for renewable (solar, wind, and geothermal) energy resources affecting Department of the Interior managed lands, while ensuring full environmental review, to at least 16,500 Megawatts (since 2009).
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>The Obama Administration’s coordinated strategy to develop all appropriate sources of renewable and conventional energy on U.S. public lands calls for development of onshore and offshore renewable energy under a ‘Smart from the Start’ approach that prioritizes and processes existing applications in a coordinated, focused manner with full environmental analysis and public review.

As manager of one-fifth of the nation’s landmass and 1.7 billion acres of the outer continental shelf, the U.S. Department of the Interior has the resources to help America produce more energy at home, thereby supporting a growing economy and job creation and reducing dependence on foreign oil and increasing sustainable practices with reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Secretary Sally Jewell has placed a priority on “Powering Our Future,” emphasizing the responsible development of conventional and renewable resources on our nation’s public lands and waters.

Onshore, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has identified 20.6 million acres of public land with wind energy potential in 11 western states, 30 million acres with solar energy potential in six southwestern states, and 111 million acres of public land in western states and Alaska with geothermal resource potential.&amp;nbsp; Offshore, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) manages the Outer Continental Shelf, 1.7 billion acres of federal-offshore lands with enormous wind-energy potential, and approved in 2011 the construction plan for Cape Wind Energy off the coast of Massachusetts.

In addition to the multiple renewable energy efforts on public lands, the Department of Interior is reducing energy consumption within its own buildings while also self-generating renewable energy at over 1,000 Interior sites nationwide, including locations such as visitor centers, wildlife refuges, recreation centers, and tribal facilities.&amp;nbsp; Developing such renewable energy resources responsibly could help support a growing economy and protect our national interests while reducing our dependence on foreign oil and climate-changing greenhouse gas emissions.

Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives

As the means for advancing the Administration’s ‘all-of-the-above’ strategy to develop domestic energy resources, realizing one of the Secretary of the Interior’s key priorities in creating a new energy frontier and as reflected in Interior’s Strategic Plan’s mission area to “Powering Our Future and Responsible Use of the Nation’s Resources,” this goal continues to expand upon the efforts started with the initial FY 2010/2011 Priority Goal to, “Increase approved capacity authorized for renewable (solar, wind, and geothermal) energy resources on Department of the Interior managed lands, while ensuring full environmental review, by at least 9,000 megawatts through 2011.”&amp;nbsp; As part of securing America’s energy future, DOI is helping to move our nation toward a clean-energy economy. At Interior, this means changing the way we do business by opening our doors to responsible development of renewable energy on our public lands. This means using a ‘Smart from the Start’ approach that prioritizes and processes existing applications in a coordinated, focused manner with full environmental analysis and public review.&amp;nbsp; Efforts include facilitating environmentally appropriate renewable-energy projects involving solar, wind and waves, geothermal, and hydropower. These resources, developed in the right ways and the right places, will help curb our dependence on foreign oil, reduce our use of fossil fuels and promote new industries and jobs here in America.

Key barriers and challenges 

Renewable energy projects, especially solar and wind, are complex.&amp;nbsp; The Department is committed to permitting renewable energy projects on public lands in an environmentally responsible manner.&amp;nbsp; As a result, proposed projects are sometimes rejected or reduced in size and scope to avoid or minimize impacts to tribal and cultural resources, threatened and endangered species and their habitat, or areas near or adjacent to lands designated by Congress, the President, or Secretary for the protection of sensitive viewsheds, resources, and values that could be adversely affected by development.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, renewable energy companies sometimes decide to scale down, modify timelines and develop their projects in phases, or otherwise modify or withdraw projects for reasons unrelated to the permitting process.

By tracking progress on a quarterly basis, Interior is aware of the emerging complex issues and challenges associated with the formulation of renewable energy projects that require time and resources to address—including for example, rerouting and modification of plans to avoid impacts to natural resources like sensitive avian and wildlife species and tribal concerns.&amp;nbsp; Further, while Interior agencies play a critical role in facilitating the siting and permitting of renewable energy projects on public lands, there are other factors that impact a potential project’s progress, including the project proponent’s ability to secure financing and to obtain power purchase agreements with electric utility companies.&amp;nbsp; Technology and transmission constraints, such as an applicant needing to upgrade a transmission line, can also impact the overall schedule.

Stakeholder Engagement

This goal includes a broad number of stakeholders within Interior and externally.&amp;nbsp; It is a continuation of a FY 2012-2013 goal that was developed by BLM in concert with the Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management.&amp;nbsp; Other Federal agencies including DOI, USDA, EPA, NOAA; Interior bureaus including FWS, NPS, USGS; as well as States, local entities, conservation groups, industry and others&amp;nbsp; are engaged to advance the Administration’s ‘all-of-the-above’ strategy to develop domestic energy resources and to achieve one of the Secretary of the Interior’s top priorities for “Powering Our Future.”

Significance of the Accomplishment (through the Priority Goal) especially in relation to past experience and benefit to the public

Advancing clean energy options remains a key component of the Department’s climate change efforts.&amp;nbsp; The Department is providing clean energy permitting on public lands and supporting extension of a modern electric grid to meet the President’s challenge to double renewable energy generation by 2020.&amp;nbsp; Since 2009, the Department has approved wind, solar, and geothermal utility-scale projects and connected actions on public or tribal lands and offshore areas, enough to power approximately 5 million homes.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

Along with BLM’s efforts, the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) is engaged in energy planning and review to assist other agencies and the energy industry in avoiding and otherwise mitigating the impacts of energy development on fish and wildlife Federal trust resources.&amp;nbsp; FWS has issued onshore wind energy guidelines to help developers avoid and minimize impacts to land-based wind projects on wildlife and their habitats.&amp;nbsp; The voluntary guidelines were developed through an intensive public process with help from the wind energy, industry states, and wildlife conservation groups.

The National Park Service (NPS) also plays a special role in renewable energy to ensure that any leasing, siting, and permitting of energy facilities on the public lands near parks and other special status areas is done in a way that safeguards their resources and values. When the permitting of energy development could impact adjacent park units and other special status areas, the NPS is active in park protection and the decision mak­ing process.

BOEM held two offshore wind lease sales in 2013 in lands offshore of Virginia, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island for future wind energy development and continues assessments for potential future permitting for the generation of power from renewable resources in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).&amp;nbsp; BOEM has worked closely with state, tribal and local stakeholders and industry to develop and implement a regulatory framework for offshore ocean wind, wave and current energy development and identified several Wind Energy Areas along the Mid-Atlantic OCS that have the highest potential wind resources and fewest competing use conflicts.&amp;nbsp; Focusing development in these pre-approved areas will expedite the development of the region’s ample wind resources.

Contributing programs or partners outside the agency

Interior works with a number of agencies coordinating renewable energy work, including other Federal, State and local land managers and resource management agencies with responsibilities in the outer continental shelf.&amp;nbsp; The United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Forest Service manages 193 million acres of National Forest System lands that are important sources of both conventional and renewable forms of en­ergy.&amp;nbsp; In 2011, Interior and USDA issued a joint report to Congress highlighting the potential for responsible renewable energy development on Federal lands and a framework for interdepartmental cooperation.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The Department of Energy (DOE) has been a long-standing partner with both DOI and USDA.&amp;nbsp; The cooperation with DOE falls into several areas including training, direct tech­nical assistance, policy support, transmission planning, siting of large scale projects, research and development of new technologies, and spon­soring research and development of wind turbine impacts on wildlife.

The Department of the Interior, the Department of the Army, and the Department of Energy have significantly advanced potential development of hydropower generation in the United States with implementation of&amp;nbsp;an interagency Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on hydropower.&amp;nbsp; The interagency cooperation has enabled the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Department of the Interior, and the Department of Energy to coordinate their hydropower research and development efforts that led to advances in hydropower technology, streamlining of the licensing and permitting process, assessment of the potential for adding hydropower generation at existing facilities, and the development of a database for all existing U.S. hydropower infrastructure.
