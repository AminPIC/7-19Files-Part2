</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Problem or opportunity being addressed

The Nation faces an increasing set of water resource challenges: aging water-related infrastructure, rapid population growth, depletion of groundwater resources, and climate variability and change. Shortages and water use conflicts have become more commonplace in many areas of the US, even in &quot;normal&quot; years. Water issues and challenges are especially increasing in the West, due to prolonged drought and population shift.Traditional water management approaches, by themselves, no longer meet today's need.Federal leadership is critical to widespread acceptance and implementation of effective conservation and recycling techniques.

Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives

As the means for realizing one of the Secretary of the Interior’s key priorities for tackling the water challenges in the west, this goal will add to the achievements reflected in the Strategic Plan under the mission area to “Sustainably Manage Energy, Water, and Natural Resources.

Reclamation works collaboratively with non-federal, state, local and tribal governments, water districts, and other entities, on a cost-shared basis to implement projects that improve water management and result in water conservation in the 17 Western states.&amp;nbsp; This includes projects to line unlined canals, install remote technology to allow for more accurate control over water deliveries, install new water measurement devices, and other projects that allow water users to decrease water diversions by increasing efficiency and operational flexibility.&amp;nbsp; By conserving water that can be made available for other uses, these projects contribute to the goal by increasing the available water supply and contribute to Reclamation’s broader objective of achieving a more sustainable water supply.

A sustainable water supply is critical to address current and future water shortages; degraded water quality; increased demands for water from growing populations and energy needs; amplified recognition of environmental water requirements; the potential for decreased water supply availability due to drought, climate change, or decreased storage and delivery capacity; and water inequity for Indian tribes and rural communities disadvantaged by financial need or geographic isolation.&amp;nbsp; Reclamation believes that water conservation, use of water markets, and improved efficiency are crucial elements of any plan to address western water issues. With leveraged water sustainability grants, an important step will be taken towards increasing conservation for a more efficient use of water in the West.

Key barriers and challenges 

The primary challenges and risks that influence achievement of the Priority Goal include:


	The availability of data needed to measure water conserved.
	Water savings are heavily dependent upon applications submitted by project sponsors.
	State Water Laws (e.g., disincentives to water conservation).
	Ability to complete environmental compliance in a reasonable timeframe and cost.
	Local cost-shares (e.g., inability to meet cost-share requirements identified by respective program).


Stakeholder Engagement

This goal is a continuation of the FY 2012-2013 goal that was developed by the Reclamation Commissioner and the Assistant Secretary Water and Science as a means for helping achieve one of the Secretary of the Interior’s top priorities in addressing the water challenges facing the western U.S.

Programs that contribute to the Priority Goal for Water Conservation provide funding for improvements proposed, planned, and carried out by non-Federal entities with Reclamation’s assistance.Collaboration is therefore a crucial aspect of efforts to achieve this Priority Goal. Reclamation also incorporates stakeholder feedback into its conservation efforts by engaging stakeholders during program formulation and significant program revisions.For example, Reclamation made draft funding criteria for the Title XVI Program available for public review and comment in 2010 and incorporated feedback into final criteria.Similarly, the WaterSMART Strategic Implementation Plan was published in the Federal Register in March 2011 and comments were incorporated into the final document.Reclamation also routinely works with its partners at the State and local level through public outreach meetings, scoping committees, and through reporting and program oversight.

During 2015, and after target development, Congress provided additional funding for water conservation efforts to mitigate for drought conditions, and Reclamation was able to provide grants to achieve additional water conservation capacity.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

Six quarterly milestones were identified for Q4 of FY 2015.&amp;nbsp; Five milestones were fully met with Reclamation awarding funding for: (1) WaterSMART Grants; (2) Title XVI Program; (3) CALFED Water Conservation Grants; (4) Water Conservation Field Services Program; and (5) Phase II construction of the Yakima River Basin Water Enhancement Project (YRBWEP). The final milestone, awarding funding for the Upper Colorado River Recovery Implementation Program (UCRRIP), was not completed due to insufficient qualified responses to the solicitation; funding for this program is expected to be awarded by December 31, 2015.

This goal continues in FY 2016-2017.

Significance of the Accomplishment (through the Priority Goal) especially in relation to past experience and benefit to the public

Together, projects funded from 2010-2015 have contributed 977,454 acre-feet of capacity toward the goal.&amp;nbsp; These investments are expected to result in water savings equivalent to the amount necessary to meet the needs of more than 3.9 million people. &amp;nbsp;Water is only renewable if well managed, and a sustainable water supply is critical to address the demands for energy and for all uses of water, e.g. individual, agricultural, industrial, and ecological. Reclamation strives to fund capacity-improvement projects to achieve higher water efficiencies (and reduce water stress) for ecological health, economic welfare, and social equality, especially for contemporary populations of Native Americans and rural communities disadvantaged by financial need or geographic isolation and for future generations who face a potential future of climate change, higher energy costs, water and food shortage, poverty, depleted fisheries and species extinction.

The following programs assist Reclamation in accomplishing its goal to enable capability to increase available water supply for agricultural, municipal, industrial, and environmental uses in the western United States:&amp;nbsp; WaterSMART Grants; Title XVI; Water Conservation Field Services Program; CALFED Water Use Efficiency Grants; Yakima River Basin Water Enhancement Project; and the Upper Colorado River Recovery Implementation Program.&amp;nbsp; These programs contribute to the goal of increasing the available water supply through cost-shared water management and efficiency projects that will result in water conservation:

WaterSMART Grants

In promoting and facilitating water conservation, Reclamation provides cost-shared grants, on a competitive basis, through WaterSMART Grants that provide up to 50% of the cost of on-the-ground projects that save water, increase energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy in water management, address endangered species and other environmental issues, and facilitate transfers to new uses.

Title XVI Program

Through the Title XVI Water Reclamation and Reuse Program, authorized by P.L.I02-575 in 1992, as amended, Reclamation provides financial and technical assistance to local water agencies for the planning, design, and construction of water reclamation and reuse.&amp;nbsp; Water reuse projects develop and supplement urban and irrigation water supplies through water reuse, thereby improving efficiency, providing flexibility during water shortages, and diversifying the water supply.

CALFED Water Use Efficiency Grants

CALFED is a combined State of California and Federal program focused on the restoration of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta’s fragile ecosystem while improving water supply reliability for urban and agricultural water users. &amp;nbsp;The goal of the Water Use Efficiency Grant Program is to accelerate the implementation of cost-effective actions that provide state-wide benefits through water conservation.

Water Conservation Field Services Program (WCFSP)

Through the WCFSP, Reclamation makes available small-scale cost-shared financial assistance at the area and regional office levels for several types of activities, including on-the-ground efficiency improvements that lead to quantifiable water savings.&amp;nbsp; Reclamation limits WCFSP awards to no more than $100,000 in Federal funding per project.

Yakima River Basin Water Enhancement Project (YRBWEP)

The purpose of the YRBWEP is to evaluate and implement structural and nonstructural measures to increase the reliability of the irrigation water supply and enhance streamflows and fish passage in the Yakima River basin.&amp;nbsp; Activities include facility modifications and implementation of diversion reduction measures to reduce the demand on the available water supply.

Upper Colorado River Recovery Implementation Program

One component of the multi-agency, multi-interest group Upper Colorado River Recovery Implementation Program is the Orchard Mesa Irrigation District Canal Automation Project, through which flows in a critical reach of the Colorado River in western Colorado are augmented.&amp;nbsp; This reach of the river, extending from the Grand Valley Irrigation Company diversion dam to the confluence with the Gunnison River, is heavily impacted by multiple Federal and private irrigation diversions. The project consists of constructing a canal automation system that will provide the ability to more closely match irrigation diversions to actual water demands.&amp;nbsp; As a result, conserved water will be redirected to an existing hydroelectric power plant that discharges back to the river upstream of the depleted river reach, thereby augmenting flows in critical habitat and increasing clean renewable energy.&amp;nbsp; This large, multi-year project includes state, and local cost-share funding.

Contributing programs or partners outside the agency

The programs contributing to this goal provide financial assistance to non-federal entities including states, tribes, local governments, irrigation and water districts, and other entities with water management and delivery authority.&amp;nbsp; While other Federal entities do not implement the projects funded by these programs, they play an important role in supporting these efforts.&amp;nbsp; Following are some examples of how other Federal agencies are involved in the contributing programs:


	Reclamation works collaboratively with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to maximize the effectiveness of its water sustainability efforts though the WaterSMART Program. The USGS contributes to the WaterSMART Program through its Water Census activities, which provide important water availability information that can inform water conservation projects.
	A WaterSMART Task Force made up of representatives from all Interior agencies was established to implement the WaterSMART Program, conduct education and awareness about program objectives, develop and expand partnerships with States and Tribes to implement the WaterSMART Strategy, and evaluate and expand recommendations for incorporating water conservation criteria in the Department’s planning efforts.&amp;nbsp; The Task Force is chaired by the Assistant Secretary of Water and Science and includes the Solicitor, and heads of each bureau and office under the Department.
	Through CALFED, Reclamation works with a consortium of 13 Federal and 12 California state agencies to develop a long term, comprehensive plan to restore the ecological health and improve the water management of the California Bay-Delta.
	Through the Upper Colorado River Recovery Implementation Program, Reclamation works collaboratively with program participants including, the States of Colorado, Utah and Wyoming; Western Area Power Administration, National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service; hydropower consumer representatives (Colorado River Energy Distributors Association), environmental/conservation organizations (The Nature Conservancy and Western Resource Advocates), and water user representatives to conserve water, enhance endangered fish habitat and increase renewable hydroelectric energy.


Additional Federal agencies that support the achievement of the Priority Goal through the integration of various water conservation activities include:


	U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).
	Department of Energy (DOE) - Energy Efficiency/Renewable Energy (EERE).
	Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) - Alliance for Water Efficiency (AWE).
	Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) - Indian Irrigation Program.
	Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) - Environmental Quality.
	Incentives Program (EQIP) and Conservation Technical Assistance (CTA).
