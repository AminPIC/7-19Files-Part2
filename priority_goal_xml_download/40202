</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>GOAL OVERVIEW

The adoption of college- and career-ready standards is the foundation to ensuring every student graduates from high school with meaningful opportunities to be successful.&amp;nbsp;The reauthorized&amp;nbsp;Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), maintains the requirement&amp;nbsp;that States develop and implement challenging academic content standards in reading/language arts, mathematics, and science. In the past, those standards did not always reflect the knowledge and skills needed for success after high school, either in further education or in a job. Additionally, college- and career-ready standards must be coupled with high-quality aligned assessments to measure the extent to which students are mastering the standards. High-quality, annual Statewide assessments are essential to providing critical information about student achievement and growth to parents, teachers, principals, and administrators at all levels. When the assessment system is aligned with the academic content and achievement standards that a State expects all children to know and be able to do, it provides the roadmap for aligning instruction to meet the academic needs of students.&amp;nbsp; High-quality, annual, Statewide assessments provide information on&amp;nbsp;all&amp;nbsp;students so that educators can improve educational outcomes, close achievement gaps among subgroups of historically underserved students, increase equity, and improve instruction.

&amp;nbsp;

Through the Race to the Top- Assessment (RTTA) program, ESEA flexibility, the Enhanced Assessment Grant program,&amp;nbsp; formula funds to all States for developing and administering Statewide assessments, and other federal programs, the Department of Education (ED) has provided and continues to provide significant resources to support States in implementing college- and career-ready standards and aligned high-quality assessments for all students, including English Learners, students with disabilities,&amp;nbsp;economically disadvantaged&amp;nbsp;and low-achieving students. The RTTA consortia and the two consortia that have developed alternate assessments based on alternate achievement standards for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities completed the field testing of their assessments during the 2013-2014 school year and successfully implemented the first full administration in spring 2015.&amp;nbsp;28 States, DC, and the US Virgin Islands (USVI) participated in the Partnerships for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC) or Smarter Balanced - the two RTTA consortia- first operational administration in spring 2015.&amp;nbsp; 22 of those states, DC, and the USVI administered PARCC or Smarter Balanced in spring 2016.

&amp;nbsp;

As States and districts transition to the ESSA, ED will continue working to support States with the implementation of their college- and career-ready standards and aligned assessments for all students, including English Learners, students with disabilities, economically disadvantaged and low-achieving students to ensure that all students are prepared for post-secondary success.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

KEY BARRIERS AND CHALLENGES

A challenge facing ED over the next two years relates to the changes States may make to their currently adopted college- and career-ready standards and their aligned assessments, as a result of internal pushback due to concerns about overtesting, technological challenges or political challenges. In many cases, these barriers and challenges may prohibit a State from transitioning to or keeping a high-quality assessment.

&amp;nbsp;

Additionally, ED is working to support States with the implementation of their college- and career-ready standards and aligned assessments for all students, including English Learners, students with disabilities, economically disadvantaged and low-achieving students to ensure that all students are prepared for post-secondary success. &amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS

ED has and continues to seek input from a wide variety of stakeholders in the early stages of implementation of the new ESSA.&amp;nbsp; On December 22, 2015, the Department published in the Federal Register a Request for Information, seeking advice and recommendations regarding topics under Title I of the ESEA where regulations would be beneficial.&amp;nbsp; ED has also held over 200 meetings with a wide variety of stakeholders to ask for advice on regulations, guidance, or technical assistance that will be necessary to ensure successful transition to and implementation of the new law, including the standards and assessments provisions.&amp;nbsp;In January 2016, the Department announced its intention to undertake a negotiated rulemaking process to regulate on provisions related to Statewide assessments under Title I of the ESSA and issued a call for negotiators, In March and April 2016, a committee representing a wide variety of stakeholders, including Federal administrators, State administrators, district administrators, teachers, principals, other schools leaders, paraprofessionals, civil rights organizations and the business community, assembled to draft such regulations. The committee reached consensus on the proposed regulations, and the Department published those draft regulations as part of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on July 11, 2016. Hundreds of commenters commented through the public comment period on the proposed regulations, which ended on September 9, 2016.&amp;nbsp; ED is currently reviewing comments before releasing a final regulation this year.&amp;nbsp;

ED is taking steps to develop and target technical assistance activities that will, in part, increase State capacity to leverage resources and continue to identify promising practices across multiple States.&amp;nbsp; First, ED will continue to provide assistance to States in understanding the recently released Title I assessment peer review guidance, which articulates the requirements for a high-quality assessment system to help support State assessment development; ED is providing technical assistance to States on this new guidance and will provide States with determinations and peer feedback in FY 2017.&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Second, ED continues to&amp;nbsp; solicit input from the field – through stakeholder meetings and listening sessions–&amp;nbsp;on the technical assistance and guidance that are most needed to help States and districts successfully transition to ESSA, including its provisions related to standards and assessments, and will continue to develop plans to support States and districts on identified priorities. ED will also continue to implement its monitoring processes for OSS programs to provide feedback on State implementation of college- and career-ready standards and high quality aligned assessments.&amp;nbsp; ED will ensure that where monitoring has identified challenges in implementation, States address these challenges.&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Third, ED will develop and publish a Notice of Final Rulemaking related to the requirements for assessment systems in Title I, Part A of the ESSA (based on the consensus draft language agreed to by the members of the negotiated rulemaking committee and comments received through the public comment period) and the requirements for States interested in developing innovative assessment demonstration projects, authorized under Title I, Part B of the ESSA.

&amp;nbsp;

Fourth, ED is working internally to coordinate the provision of technical assistance across OESE, the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP), and other related offices and programs.&amp;nbsp; ED also funds a Center on Standards and Assessments Implementation (part of the ESEA Comprehensive Centers program) that helps build the capacity of State educational agencies to implement college- and career-ready standards.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Finally, as described in the President’s Testing Action Plan, ED will continue to support States efforts to eliminate duplicative local or State assessments and continue to develop new and innovative approaches to using assessments effectively to support and inform classroom instruction by continuing to highlight and discuss the President’s Testing Action Plan and related resources.

	In October, 2015, ED, in conjunction with the White House, released President Obama’s Testing Action Plan, which included a set of principles for fewer and smarter assessments, and a list of actions the Administration will take to reduce over-testing. ED released the 6-month report of the President’s Testing Action Plan (available at:&amp;nbsp;http://www2.ed.gov/admins/lead/account/tap6monthsrpt4182016.pdf) on April 15, 2016.
	On December 20, 2015, President Obama signed the Every Student Succeeds Act into law, which requires – for the first time – that all students in America be taught to high academic standards that will prepare them to succeed in college and careers.&amp;nbsp; It also ensures that vital information is provided to educators, families, students, and communities through annual Statewide assessments that measure students’ progress toward those high standards.
	ED announced its intention to regulate on State assessments under the ESSA in January 2016 and began the first formal negotiation session at the end of Q2. Negotiations were completed during Q3 and the committee, which represented a broad array of stakeholders including State and local administrators, teachers, principals and other school leaders, parents, civil rights organizations, tribal leaders and the business community, reached consensus on draft regulatory language. These regulations will help support States in implementing rigorous college- and career-ready assessments that are valid, reliable, and fair, as well as aligned to college- and career-ready standards, and will provide States direction as they implement new flexibilities and requirements in the law.&amp;nbsp; For example, the statute allows States to provide LEAs with flexibility to implement a locally selected, nationally recognized assessment for high school students, so long as that assessment meets a set of technical criteria and is approved by the State. The consensus-based regulatory language includes requirements to ensure that locally selected, nationally recognized high school academic assessments are used by at least some institutions of higher education for entry or placement, and that these assessments go through ED’s assessment peer review process for approval. At the beginning of Q3, the Department issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) that included the consensus-based regulatory language. See&amp;nbsp;https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2016/07/11/2016-16124/title-i-improving-the-academic-achievement-of-the-disadvantaged-academic-assessments?utm_content=header&amp;amp;utm_medium=slideshow&amp;amp;utm_source=homepage&amp;nbsp;for the NPRM. The public comment period for these proposed regulations closed on September 9, 2016, and ED is currently reviewing comments and preparing a Notice of Final Rulemaking for release by the end of the year.
	Additionally, ED released a second NPRM to support states in implementing a new innovative demonstration authority under Title I, part B of the ESSA, that will allow up to 7 states to pilot new approaches to statewide assessment systems before scaling such assessments statewide. See:https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2016/07/11/2016-16125/elementary-and-secondary-education-act-of-1965-as-amended-by-the-every-student-succeeds?utm_content=header&amp;amp;utm_medium=slideshow&amp;amp;utm_source=homepage. The public comment period for these proposed regulations closed on September 9, 2016, and ED is currently reviewing comments and preparing a Notice of Final Rulemaking for release by the end of the year.
	The Enhanced Assessment Grants (EAG) program provides competitive grant awards to State educational agencies (SEAs) and consortia of SEAs to help them enhance the quality of their assessment instruments and assessment systems. ED released a notice of final priorities and a Notice Inviting Applications for the EAG program in Q3 (See:&amp;nbsp;https://federalregister.gov/a/2016-18532). ED anticipates announcing grantees under the EAG program in Q1 of FY 2017. &amp;nbsp;
	In Q3, ED began conducting peer reviews of 38 State assessment systems to determine whether they meet the requirements of Title I of the ESEA. Among other criteria, this peer review evaluated the alignment of State assessment systems with college- and career-ready standards. This process, which is iterative and is based on documentation from the States confirming the quality of their assessment systems, will be ongoing, and ED anticipates providing States with feedback, based on the peers’ review, later this year.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>The goal for America’s educational system is clear: every student should graduate from high school ready for college and a career.  Every student should have meaningful opportunities from which to choose upon graduation from high school.  Over the past few years, states, districts, and schools have initiated groundbreaking reforms and innovations to try to meet this goal.  For the first time, almost every state is supporting higher standards that will demonstrate that students are truly college- and career-ready. States are also coming together to develop the next generation of assessments that are not only aligned with these new standards but also advance essential skills that promote critical thinking, problem solving, and the application of knowledge.  At the same time, states, districts, and schools are working to meet the challenges of putting a highly-qualified teacher in every classroom and a strong and effective leader in every school; building local capacity to support successful school turnarounds; redesigning high school education by building stronger connections among secondary education, postsecondary education, and the workplace; and improving teacher preparation and classroom instruction in STEM education.
 
But, while many schools are increasing the quality of instruction and improving academic achievement, there is also broad agreement that the U.S. education system fails to consistently provide all students with the excellent education necessary to achieve college- and career-readiness.  The result is that too many U.S. students are failing to reach their full potential. Recent National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) scores show that low-income students are “roughly two years of learning behind the average better-off student of the same age.” Also, according to the 2009 McKinsey report The Economic Impact of the Achievement Gap in America’s Schools, on average, “black and Latino students are roughly two to three years of learning behind white students of the same age.”
 
Many children, particularly low-income children, students with disabilities, English learners, and children of color confront not only an achievement gap but also an opportunity gap. Today, a student in a school with high minority enrollment is much less likely to go to a school that offers calculus and physics than a student in a high school with low minority enrollment. Less than 8 percent of students taking Advanced Placement (AP) mathematics or AP science courses today are African American. Closing the opportunity gap will require that school resources, talent, and spending be targeted to the kids who need help the most.
 
The Department’s elementary and secondary education reforms focus on the building blocks needed for schools, school districts, and states to more consistently deliver excellent classroom instruction for all students. The foundation of these reforms is a system for improving learning and teaching that aligns with internationally benchmarked college- and career-ready standards, high-quality formative and summative assessments, and engaging and effective instructional content.  Ensuring that U.S. students have the critical thinking skills and other tools they need to be effective in the 21st-century economy means improving teaching and learning in all content areas—from literacy, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to history, civics and government, geography, foreign languages, the arts, economics and financial literacy, environmental education, computer science, health education, and other subjects.
 
Highly important to student success is the creation of a sustainable collaborative relationship between labor and management. Increasing student achievement and improving student outcomes while effectively implementing college- and career-ready standards can be a direct result of effective labor-management collaboration. Since 2009, the Department has worked closely with national labor-management partners to support states and districts in building their capacity for collaboration in an effort to improve teaching, learning, and instructional content.  Strong labor-management collaboration can be a bridge to success rather than a barrier.
 
A strong reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA)that reinforces and extends the progress already being made to strengthen the quality of elementary and secondary education would further this goal.
How will we measure success?  
 
The Department will use the following indicators to measure its success in helping states and school districts deliver excellent instruction that is aligned with rigorous standards while ensuring effective support services that help students graduate college- and career-ready.
 
Elementary and Secondary Education Indicators of Success
 
Increase number of states that have adopted college- and career-ready standards
Increase number of states that are implementing next-generation assessments, aligned with college- and career-ready standards
Increase number of states that have fully implemented teacher and principal evaluation and support systems that consider multiple measures of effectiveness, with student growth as a significant factor
Decrease use of out-of-school suspensions, expulsions, and alternative school placements and reduce disparities in the rates these sanctions are applied to students with disabilities and youths of color
Decrease number of high schools with low graduation rates
Increase percentage of priority schools that have met the state exit criteria and exited priority school status
Increase percentage of focus schools that have met the state exit criteria and exited focus school status
Increase number of postsecondary STEM credentials awarded
Increase percentage of teachers who teach STEM as their main assignment and who hold a corresponding undergraduate degree
Increase number of public high school graduates who have taken at least one STEM Advanced Placement exam
What could hold us back?  What’s beyond our control?  (External Risk Factors)
 
States are moving forward in implementing important reforms to increase student achievement, close achievement gaps, and improve the quality of instruction.  Yet, efforts to implement college- and career-ready standards and new, aligned assessments, to acquire higher-quality instructional materials, and to develop and implement teacher and school leader evaluation systems have run up against resource limitations.  Developing and administering the next generation of assessments and supporting teachers and leaders through training related to the new standards will require continuing financial support, in addition to expert technical assistance, in order to help states tackle these new and complex reforms in a manner tailored to their unique needs. Similarly, states face challenges in turning around a large number of our lowest-performing schools, and in sustaining growth and improvement as grant funding declines. Finally, the pace of reforms may be dictated in part by future Congressional appropriations and the extent to which the reauthorization of ESEA requires rigorous interventions in each state’s lowest-achieving schools.
 
In the current economic climate, student needs often are growing while school budgets are contracting. Expanding services and supports to address students’ mental, emotional, and behavioral health, and to create positive school environments where all students can learn and excel will be a challenge. Cross-agency collaboration helps to connect agency programs and leverage community assets, but additional resources are needed to bring to scale effective school-based practices that support students struggling with trauma and poverty, improve student behavior, and increase campus safety.
 
To achieve the STEM goals, there needs to be improved coordination among federal agencies. In addition, high-quality, STEM-specific technical assistance is needed to address the limited capacity of some states and school districts to lead STEM-related programs. Finally, more states and districts must adopt rigorous STEM standards that will prepare students to succeed in these fields at the postsecondary level.
