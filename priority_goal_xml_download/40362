This priority goal supports the Department of Commerce’s longer-term goal focused on achieving 10 months for first action pendency and 20 months for total pendency by FY 2019.
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>American innovators and businesses rely on the legal rights associated with patents in order to reap the benefits of their innovations. Timely issuance of high-quality patents provides certainty in the market and allows businesses and innovators to make informed, timely decisions on product and service development. &amp;nbsp;Processing patent applications in a quality and timely manner advances economic prosperity by using intellectual property (IP) as a tool to create a business environment that cultivates and protects new ideas, technologies, services and products.

Our dedicated employees have reduced&amp;nbsp;the patent application backlog from a high of over 764,000 in January 2009 to 558,091 in October 2015, a 27 percent reduction.&amp;nbsp;Between the end of fiscal year (FY) 2009 and the end of October 2015, first action pendency decreased by 8.8 months and total pendency by eight months. First action pendency measures the time from when an application is filed to the mailing date of the initial communication to the applicant from the patent examiner.&amp;nbsp; The USPTO did not meet the first action pendency FY 16 goal.&amp;nbsp; Given the lower-than-expected filings in FY 2015, at the beginning of FY 2016 the USPTO projected a 1 percent overall growth in UPR filings; however, actual growth was in excess of 5 percent, and consequently the first action pendency result was negatively impacted.

Total pendency measures the time from filing until an application is either issued as a patent or abandoned.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The USPTO did meet its FY 2016 goal.&amp;nbsp;

Additionally, from an all-time high of 111,924 in February 2013, the Request for Continued Examination (RCE) backlog was reduced to 27,394 in October 2015, a 75.5 percent reduction.

We want to continue to build on these successes, and the America Invents Act (AIA) legislation passed by Congress supports doing just that.&amp;nbsp; The AIA allows us to set our fees and retain fees collected above our appropriated level. This means our financial health is more stable than in the past, giving us a unique opportunity to further expand our quality efforts throughout the entire process.

Patent quality is central to fulfilling a core mission of the USPTO, which as stated in the Constitution, is to “promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts.” It is critically important that the USPTO issue patents that are both correct and clear. Historically, our primary focus has been on correctness, but the evolving patent landscape has challenged us to increase our focus on clarity.&amp;nbsp;

Patents of the highest quality can help to stimulate and promote efficient licensing, research and development, and future innovation, without resorting to high-cost court proceedings. Through correctness and clarity, such patents better enable potential users of patented technologies to make informed decisions on how to avoid infringement, whether to seek a license, and/or when to settle or litigate a patent dispute. Patent owners also benefit from having clear notice on the boundaries of their patent rights.

Q4 – Subsequent enhancements to the OC and Search tools to address user feedback. &amp;nbsp;
</next_steps><progress_update>The USPTO achieved its total pendency target; however, it missed its first action pendency target.&amp;nbsp; Given the lower-than-expected filings in FY 2015, at the beginning of FY 2016 the USPTO projected a 1 percent overall growth in UPR filings; however, actual growth was in excess of 5 percent, and consequently the first action pendency result was negatively impacted.&amp;nbsp; First action pendency measures the time from when an application is filed to the mailing date of the initial communication to the applicant from the patent examiner.&amp;nbsp; Total pendency declined from 25.7 months in FY 16 Q3 to 25.3 months in FY 16 Q4.&amp;nbsp; Total pendency measures the time from filing until an application is either issued as a patent or abandoned.&amp;nbsp; The USPTO will continue to monitor incoming patent application filings and will make any necessary adjustments to long-term planning projections to ensure progress towards its pendency targets.

In December 2015, the USPTO announced the Topic Submission for Case Studies Pilot program through a Federal Register Notice.&amp;nbsp; Of the many topics submitted in response to the notice, the USPTO selected six to be the subject of case studies for the pilot.&amp;nbsp; These studies will help the USPTO identify quality issues and examples of best practices as well as improve patent work products and ascertain areas where further training may be required.&amp;nbsp;

The USPTO has launched&amp;nbsp;a Clarity of the Record Pilot, which is focused on improving the clarity of claim constructions, reasons for allowance, and interview summaries. &amp;nbsp;The USPTO invited randomly selected examiners to participate in the pilot, and approximately 130 ultimately accepted the invitation.&amp;nbsp; The pilot participants participated in training and examined cases under the pilot guidelines.&amp;nbsp; The USPTO is currently using the information collected during the pilot to identify best examiner practices for enhancing the clarity of the record.&amp;nbsp;

The USPTO has launched Clarity of the Record Training - Improving Clarity and Reasoning in Office Actions Training emphasizing how and why to make the record clear.&amp;nbsp; The Agency has provided examiners with training on functional claiming, how to clarify the record with respect to 35 U.S.C. 112(f) limitations, drafting reasons for allowance, assessing a fully described invention under 35 U.S.C. 112(a), writing rejections under 35 U.S.C. 101, and best practices for explaining indefiniteness rejections under 35 U.S.C. 112(b).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

As part of the Clarity and Correctness Data Capture (CCDC) Program, the USPTO developed an improved data capture system that enables all reviewers, from both the Office of Patent Quality Assurance (OPQA) and supervisors in the Technology Centers (TCs), to consistently document and access quality review data in one place.&amp;nbsp; This customizable data capture system, referred to as the Master Review Form (MRF), comprises a library of standardized questions pertaining to both correctness and clarity assessments of Office actions.&amp;nbsp; Reviewers in OPQA and supervisors in the TCs are currently using the MRF.&amp;nbsp;

Related to the CCDC program, the USPTO is evaluating its Quality Metrics.&amp;nbsp; On March 25, 2016, the USPTO published a Federal Register Notice outlining a proposal to replace its Quality Composite Score with individual metrics in view of stakeholder feedback that the Quality Composite Score did not adequately reflect quality.&amp;nbsp; The Federal Register Notice also sought comments on the MRF.&amp;nbsp; By the close of the comment period, the USPTO had received 32 comments, and it will use these comments when finalizing a set of quality metrics for fiscal year 2017.

On July 11, 2016, the USPTO launched the Post-Prosecution Pilot (P3) program through a Federal Register Notice.&amp;nbsp; The P3 program combines effective features of the existing After Final Consideration Pilot (AFCP) 2.0 program and the Pre-Appeal Brief Conference Pilot program as well as new, applicant-requested features, such as providing applicants with an opportunity to present arguments to a panel at a conference.&amp;nbsp; The Federal Register Notice also solicits comments on ways to improve after final practice.

As part of the on-going Post-Grant Outcomes Pilot, examiners are notified if they are examining a patent application that is related to an issued patent undergoing an America Invents Act (AIA) Trial proceeding before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board.&amp;nbsp; The pilot gives examiners streamlined access to the contents of AIA Trial proceedings, and the Agency will use the results of the pilot to determine best practices for evaluating AIA Trial information that is relevant to currently pending applications.
