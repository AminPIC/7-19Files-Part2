Throughout FY 2014 and 2015, OPM will target 99 percent or more of all OPM investigations adjudicated as “quality complete” by agencies receiving closed investigations.
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Beginning in FY 2013, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) further challenged the background investigations process by revising the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act timeliness metrics to establish a separate standard for Top Secret investigations.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; As a result, the DNI shifted greater management focus on the manpower intensive workload, necessitating the creation of revised workload management tools and rules to measure and manage workload by case type.

While OPM has made significant progress on timeliness since 2004, the agency has maintained its primary focus on delivering top quality products to agencies. OPM will work with its executive branch reform partners to develop and implement Executive Branch quality standards, with a measurement tool designed for universal application during both the investigative and adjudicative processes. OPM will focus on implementing these additional initiatives while maintaining timeliness objectives.&amp;nbsp; OPM will satisfy all national security standards, deliver quality products, and achieve Congressional and DNI mandated timeliness goals.

OPM is sensitive to the fiscal environment and the need for customer agencies (i.e., the employing or sponsoring agencies) to have more insight into the costs of background investigations. To this end, OPM will continue conducting business efficiency studies and maturing its cost allocation model to provide more detailed cost data and to optimize the value of OPM’s investigative products to agency adjudicators, which in turn translates into better value to taxpayers.

OPM did not meet its timeliness goals, however, due to contract decisions the agency made in the fourth quarter of FY 2014.&amp;nbsp; OPM completed the fastest 90 percent of all initial national security investigations in 67 days, on average, over its target of 40 days, and 32 days longer than in FY 2014.&amp;nbsp; The average number of days for OPM to complete the fastest 90 percent of initial Secret national security investigations increased to 58 days during FY 2015, from an average of 30 days in FY 2014.&amp;nbsp; OPM completed the fastest 90 percent of initial Top Secret national security investigations in an average of 147 days, from an average of 75 days in FY 2014.

&amp;nbsp;


	In February 2014, OPM began performing final quality reviews of all investigations products by Federal Investigative Services (FIS) Federal staff.
	In September 2014, OPM announced it would not extend the terms of its contracts with one of the FIS contractors.&amp;nbsp; FIS continued normal operations by assigning cases in process to the Federal staff and signed a letter contract with another contractor to take on the support services contract, which was effective October 1, 2014.&amp;nbsp; Because of the reduction in investigative resources, the time to complete initial national security investigations &amp;nbsp; increased in fiscal year 2015.&amp;nbsp; To counter the loss of one of the FIS contractors, FIS and its two fieldwork contractors increased their field staff. &amp;nbsp; Actions taken to expand investigative capacity are within budget constraints, while maintaining the current high quality of OPM’s investigations.&amp;nbsp; Until these initiatives are in place, OPM expects that investigation timeliness&amp;nbsp;will continue to degrade and inventory will continue to increase through fiscal year 2016.&amp;nbsp; OPM will continue to re-evaluate its workload, case inventory, and available investigative resources to determine if additional measures are needed to meet timeliness goals and the needs of its customer agencies.
	OPM worked with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Department of Defense (DOD) and intelligence agencies to conduct a 120-day review of suitability and security clearance procedures for Federal employees and contractors.&amp;nbsp; The President approved the recommendations on March 6, 2014.
	OPM officials met with OMB and interagency partners to address how to respond to seven legislative proposals related to suitability and security clearance reform introduced in the 113th&amp;nbsp;Congress in order to enhance the accomplishment of the 120-day review recommendations.
	In the first quarter of FY 2015, OPM implemented the Tiers 1 and 2 investigation products.&amp;nbsp; The new products are based on the 2012 Federal Investigative Standards.
	OPM and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence published the final rule for Part 1400 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, Designation of National Security Positions in the Competitive Service, and Related Matters.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;This is one of the initiatives OPM and ODNI have undertaken to simplify and streamline the Federal investigative and adjudicate processes to make them more efficient and equitable. Part 1400 clarifies the requirements and procedures agencies should use when designating national security positions.


&amp;nbsp;

OPM will continue to focus on improving background investigations case processing timeliness and quality, and has set a new investigations case processing Agency Priority Goal for 2016-2017.
</progress_update><themes><theme>General Government</theme></themes><contributing_programs_and_other_factors>In accordance with Executive Order 13467, the Deputy Director for Management of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) serves as the Chair of the Performance Accountability Council (PAC).&amp;nbsp; The PAC was established to “ensure an efficient, practical, reciprocal, and aligned system for investigating and determining suitability for Government employment, contractor employee fitness, and eligibility for access to classified information” exists.

Under this strategic framework, the Director of OPM is the Suitability Executive Agent, and&amp;nbsp;the Director of National Intelligence (DNI)&amp;nbsp;is the Security Executive Agent. In this capacity as Security Executive Agent, the ODNI has provided the Executive Branch with timeliness standards for security clearance investigation performance and is developing continuous evaluation capability for certain individuals after receiving an initial clearance.

In addition, OPM’s Federal Investigative Services (FIS) is primarily responsible for this goal and is supported in this effort by the Chief Information&amp;nbsp;Officer (CIO), Office of General Council (OGC), Planning &amp;amp; Policy Analysis (PPA), and Employment Services (ES).
