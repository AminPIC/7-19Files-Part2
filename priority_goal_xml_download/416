</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Congress has mandated that small businesses receive 23% of federal government prime contracting dollars, including 5% of prime and subcontracts to Small Disadvantage Businesses; 5% of prime and subcontracts to Women-Owned Small Businesses; 3% of prime and subcontracts to HUBZone Small Businesses; and 3% of prime and subcontracts to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses

Meeting and exceeding the federal government’s small business procurement goals continues to be an Administration priority.&amp;nbsp; Federal contracting with small businesses is a win-win.&amp;nbsp; Small businesses get the revenue they need to grow their businesses and create jobs, and the federal government gets the opportunity to work with some of America’s most innovative and nimble small businesses, often times with a direct line to the CEO.

In FY 2012, the federal government made real progress toward the 23 percent goal, with 22.25 percent or $89.9 billion in federal contracting dollars going to small businesses compared to 21.65 percent in FY 2011, with significant impact in key areas:


	For the first time, more agencies than ever before met or surpassed all of their prime contracting goals.
	Also, for the first time, the federal government exceeded the goal for service disabled veterans.
	The federal government had the highest percentage of contracts going to Small Disadvantage Businesses to date.


As a result of a government wide focus on increasing small business contracting opportunities, during President Obama’s first term (FY2009 - FY2012) the federal government awarded $376.2 billion in federal contracting dollars to small businesses.&amp;nbsp; This is a $48.1 billion increase over the four preceding years even as we have seen reduced spending overall.

Also, since President Obama took office, the SBA has supported more than $132.61 billion in Federal government contracting dollars to small disadvantaged businesses. This represents a 36.6 percent increase when compared to the prior Administration. Under the Bush Administration’s first term, $97.10 billion in federal government contracting dollars were awarded to small disadvantaged businesses.

Although we have seen marked success over the last few years, we know more must be done.&amp;nbsp; Many challenges exist for small businesses seeking to enter the federal procurement marketplace.


	The unpredictable and changing budget climate is a challenge for small businesses, and SBA is working hard to create an environment where small businesses can be successful in the federal procurement marketplace.
	The instability and ambiguity caused by Continuing Resolutions make it difficult to agency acquisition staff to plan effectively for small business utilization.
	Entering the federal supply chain can often be a lengthy and arduous process for many small businesses.


SBA’s GCBD unit must implement effective and efficient strategies to monitor the agencies’ progress to goal, support small businesses interested in working with the government and encourage agencies to improve data quality when reporting their contracting activities.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SBA will increase its efforts to collaborate with and hold&amp;nbsp;federal agencies accountable to achieving their goals.

	Worked to implement various statutory rules to increase Small Business&amp;nbsp; contracting opportunities and reduce fraud, waste, and abuse
	Chaired Small Business&amp;nbsp; Procurement Advisory Council Meetings to provide updates on Small Business programs, share best practices, and promote a dialogue that benefits Small Businesses among council members
	Held Small Business recruitment events throughout SBA’s 68 District Offices
	Provided onsite Small Business and 8(a) Partnership Agreement training to over 800 Contracting Officers and Contract Specialists at 19 different Federal Agencies.
	Conducted ChallengeHER marketing and education outreach for over 540 Women-Owned Small Businesses&amp;nbsp; (WOSB) and/or Economically Disadvantaged WOSB (EDWOSB)
	Increased focus on Native Tribal Communities and conducted various Destination HUB outreach events to engage HUBZone companies and their communities about benefits of the HUBZone Program


In Fiscal Year (FY) 2014, the SBA announced that the federal government exceeded the Small Business prime contracting goal with the best performance since the statutory establishment of the 23 percent goal in 1997. This achievement of 24.99 percent in FY 2014, for all federal contracts awarded to small businesses, totals $91.7 billion and supports 550,000 jobs in the U.S. economy.&amp;nbsp; The federal government also exceeded the statutory prime contracting goals for small disadvantaged businesses (9.46 percent vs. the 5 percent goal) and service-disabled veteran-owned Small Businesses (3.68 percent vs. the 3 percent goal), and increased its performance with awards to small firms in Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZone) (1.82 percent vs. 1.76 percent in FY 2013) and women-owned Small Business concerns (4.68 percent vs. 4.32 percent in FY 2013).

In FY 2014, five agencies met or exceeded all of their Small Business prime goals: Department of Agriculture, Department of Homeland Security, and Department of the Treasury, Department of Transportation and the Small Business Administration.&amp;nbsp; In this same fiscal year, five agencies’ grades increased, 13 remained the same, and six decreased when compared to the previous fiscal year. Three agencies received an “A+” (Agency for International Development, Department of Commerce, and Department of Homeland Security), 17 agencies received an “A”, 2 agencies received a “B”, 1 agency received a “C”, and 1 agency received an “F”.

In FY 2015, the SBA far exceeded the 23.00 percent statutory requirement for the Small Business prime contracting goal, achieving 25.75 percent.&amp;nbsp; Of note, during President Obama’s first seven years in office (FY 2009 - FY 2015), the federal government awarded $641.4 billion in federal contracting dollars to small businesses. &amp;nbsp;These results are a consequence of government-wide focus on increasing small business contracting opportunities.

SBA continues to work towards increasing opportunities for small business contracting and minimizing fraud, waste, and abuse in its programs.&amp;nbsp; As such, contracting provisions contained in the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 and the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) of 2013 have been implemented. Rules have been finalized for Subcontracting, Setting Aside Multiple-award Contracts and Orders for Small Businesses, Consolidation, and Size and Status Integrity. &amp;nbsp;SBA has also published proposed rules addressing Prime/Sub Teaming efforts on set aside contracts and implementing a Small Business Mentor Protégé Program. These rules will give agencies the tools they need to increase small business utilization. &amp;nbsp;Additionally, the SBA has issued a proposed rule to address Credit for Lower Tier Subcontracting on Small Business Subcontracting Plans contained in the NDAA of 2014, as well as a final rule implementing the statutory Sole Source Authority for Women Owned Small Business concerns contained in the NDAA of 2015.

As noted above, SBA has published proposed rules to establish a government-wide mentor-protégé program, consistent with SBA's popular 8(a) Business Development program, to match small business contractors with more experienced companies. In this process, the SBA proposed to close loopholes that masked fraud in similar past programming and to make minor changes to the 8(a) Business Development Mentor-Protégé Program to enhance consistency among all mentor-protégé programs. &amp;nbsp;The proposed rule would make several additional changes to current size standards, 8(a) Office of Hearings and Appeals, and HUBZone regulations, including ownership and control, changes in primary industry, and standards of review. These changes will address recent audit recommendations and maximize small business participation in federal prime contracts.

The SBA established an 8(a) Application Streamlining Team to develop strategies to address hundreds of complaints from 8(a) applicants and congressional representatives across the country.&amp;nbsp; The Team is responsible for improving accessibility to services for eligible 8(a) applicants by reducing the unnecessary administrative burdens while maintaining the integrity of the program and managing the risks associated with the ineligible firms that apply.&amp;nbsp; The documents eliminated from the initial request for documentation were found to be unnecessary for making a decision on the criteria used to determine eligibility.

The SBA launched Destination HUB—a new initiative to promote and support HUBZone firms in federal contracting opportunities, while ensuring local economic development boards, government officials, federal buyers, and prime contractors work hand in hand to create more sole-source and set-aside opportunities for HUBZone-certified firms. &amp;nbsp;Destination HUB is comprised of three components: (1) an in-depth examination of successes and needs in the HUBZone program, (2) analysis of ideal situations for successful HUBZone collaboration, harnessing the power of public-private partnerships and market research to recruit more firms for HUBZone participation and (3) launch of a broad grassroots educational initiative with community organizations, faith leaders, local economic development, and key stakeholders, to encourage participation in, and inspire collective ownership of, the HUBZone program. Destination HUB furthers SBA’s efforts to improve access to capital and close opportunity gaps in communities of color, by empowering entrepreneurs and small businesses economic and social mobility through employment and business growth. &amp;nbsp;Destination HUB events have been hosted in Charles Town, WV; Jackson, MS; Nashville, TN; and Tulsa, OK, Fresno, CA, and Detroit, MI. &amp;nbsp;In addition, SBA partnered with EPA to conduct targeted outreach to the Navajo small business community – firms owned by individuals or Tribal government - including HUBZone-certified small businesses, as well as those exploring certification in connection with future contracting opportunities relating to the cleanup of contaminated abandoned uranium mines. These events were held in Albuquerque, NM and Window Rock, AZ.

The SBA enhanced execution of the Surveillance Review (SR) program.&amp;nbsp; In FY 2015, the SBA directly linked buying agencies to be reviewed based upon their performance for meeting their small business goals in FY 2014. &amp;nbsp;Agencies that either missed their small business goal or had a buying activity that received either a marginal or unsatisfactory rating in the previous year were candidates for this new approach.&amp;nbsp; As a result, 30 compliance reviews were conducted on 12 federal agencies in FY 2015.&amp;nbsp; This new process resulted in 50 percent of the federal agencies having surveillance reviews conducted on one or more of their buying centers.&amp;nbsp; The SR examines an agency’s small business program and ensures that agencies are 1) providing maximum practicable opportunity for small business; 2) complying with regulations and statutes; 3) promoting a sound program through its leadership; and 4) addressing corrective actions identified in previous reviews.&amp;nbsp; The agencies that received reviews in FY 2015 included the Department of Defense, Department of Interior, Department of Commerce, Department of Energy, Department of Justice, Environmental Protection Agency, General Services Administration, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, NASA, Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Veterans Affairs.

In an effort to maintain continued success increasing small business contracting opportunities, the SBA worked with the 24 Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act agencies to establish the FY 2016 prime and subcontracting goals.&amp;nbsp; The difference between the FY 2015 goal-setting process and the FY 2016 goal-setting process is the inclusion of overseas contracts in FY 2016, which were previously excluded from the goaling base.&amp;nbsp; The inclusion of overseas contracts in the goaling base is a result of the NDAA of 2013 requirements to review existing goaling exclusions.&amp;nbsp; Based on the final opinion from the SBA Office of General Counsel and in consultation with the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP), overseas contracts will no longer be excluded from the goaling base. &amp;nbsp;The SBA has initiated discussions with the General Services Administration (GSA) to update the Federal Procurement Data System Next Generation (FPDS-NG) and the Small Business Goaling Report (SBGR) with this change for FY 2016.
</progress_update><themes><theme>Commerce and Housing Credit</theme></themes><contributing_programs_and_other_factors>SBA’s&amp;nbsp;Office of Government Contracting and Business Development (GCBD) is highly focused on engaging key stakeholders through outreach events and training programs.&amp;nbsp; SBA actively participants in and hosts events with the following key stakeholders:


	Federal agencies: senior officials, procurement teams and small business program team
	Small businesses
	Trade groups
	Congress: Members, staff and constituents


GCBD has a robust process in place to ensure we are appropriately engaging key stakeholders with events, outreach, marketing, communications and training. Additionally, GCBD has a process in place to ensure engagement efforts are monitored.

The SBA’s&amp;nbsp;GCBD office&amp;nbsp;takes a lead coordinating role in helping each agency meet and exceed their respective small business goals.&amp;nbsp; The Office encourages, monitors and facilitates the sharing of best practices and reports on the progress of all federal agencies in order to help the federal government meet its Congressionally-mandated small business contracting goals.

The Office of Communication and Pubic Liaison, the Office of Entrepreneurial Development, and the Office of Field Operations will promote SBA’s contracting opportunities to small business owners through comprehensive and coordinated marketing and outreach efforts, including online and in-person workshops and trainings. Additionally, SBA will work with its resource partners (including Women’s Business Centers and Small Business Development Centers) to develop outreach and training initiatives and other tools to help fully deploy the agency’s national network behind this goal.

Each federal agency is responsible for meeting its respective small business goal, and therefore has an important role to play in helping achieve the government-wide goal.&amp;nbsp; The SBA works closely with the OMB’s Office of Federal Procurement Policy to collaborate on important initiatives and develop strategies for maximizing small business participation in the federal supply chain.


	Small Business Procurement Advisory Council (SBPAC). SBA chairs the SBPAC whose members are made up of directors of the Offices of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization.&amp;nbsp; These directors are the advocates for small business within each agency, and meet regularly with their procurement offices to encourage the use of small businesses in meeting their agency goals.
	Collaboration with White House and Senior Officials. On a regular basis, the SBA collaborates with the White House and Senior Officials at each agency to ensure agencies are being held accountable for the government-wide small business contracting goal. This unprecedented collaboration has facilitated the sharing of best practices and has ensured top-level leadership commitment from across the federal government to utilize small businesses in the federal supply chain.
	Data Quality Process and the Data Quality Working Group. Consistent with SBA’s efforts to improve the quality of small business procurement data, over the last several years, SBA was able to significantly reduce the number of anomalies in agencies’ small business federal contracts.&amp;nbsp; Moving forward, SBA and OFPP will continue to work together to develop a process that will: (1) improve efforts to achieve small business goals, (2) reduce burden on the workforce, and (3) improve data quality.

</objective_statement><objective_overview>Small business contracting is one of the most important federal programs to help America’s small businesses grow and create jobs.  The federal government gets to work with the most innovative small businesses in America today, and small businesses get critical revenue to build and scale their operations.  SBA’s goal is to make sure that all federal agencies meet or exceed their targets for federal prime contracting dollars awarded to small businesses.  The SBA is improving coordination and communication across the federal government, facilitating matchmaking events, increasing online trainings and holding senior officials accountable for meeting their agencies’ small business goals.   SBA continues to simplify access to federal contracting opportunities and educate small businesses on the contracting opportunities available to them.  The SBA is also streamlining the certification process and data for federal contracting and continues to aggressively root out fraud, waste and abuse in small business contracting to ensure that contracting dollars go to deserving small businesses.
