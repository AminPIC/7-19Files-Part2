Since fiscal year 2010, HUD has completed over 510,000&amp;nbsp;green or healthy units. Between October 1, 2015 and September 30, 2017, HUD aims to increase the energy efficiency and health of the nation’s housing stock by enabling an additional 160,000 cost-effective energy efficient or healthy housing units.
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>HUD has committed to creating energy efficient, green, and healthy housing as part of a broader effort to foster the development of inclusive, sustainable communities. The residential sector is responsible for fully 21 percent of the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions.[1] With approximately 5.6&amp;nbsp;million housing units assisted through its rental assistance programs, HUD’s share of this total is significant. HUD spends an estimated $6.4 billion annually on utilities (both water and energy) in the form of allowances for tenant-paid utilities, direct operating grants for public housing, and housing assistance payments for privately-owned assisted housing. Utility costs account for around 22 percent of public housing operating budgets, and a similar share in the assisted housing sector.

Reducing these rising costs—generating savings for residents and owners, as well as for taxpayers—is a key HUD priority. Significant progress has been made over the past five years with energy retrofits, healthy housing interventions, or new energy projects completed in more than 510,000 housing units.

In FY 2016-17, HUD will continue or expand energy investments in the residential sector to support the goals of the President’s Climate Action Plan to cut energy waste in half by 2030 and accelerate clean energy leadership—both in HUD-assisted housing, as well as in market-rate housing. We will reduce barriers to financing energy efficiency as well as on-site renewable energy generation, help unlock innovative and traditional sources of capital, and strengthen codes and standards that promote energy efficiency and healthy housing.

The need to retrofit HUD-assisted housing is not limited to the efforts to increase energy efficiency and reduce costs. Housing is also an important determinant of health, and poor housing conditions are associated with a wide range of health conditions, including respiratory infections, asthma, lead poisoning, and injuries. HUD makes homes healthy and safe through several programs, led by the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes’ (OLHCHH) lead hazard control grant programs and Lead Safe Housing Rule (LSHR) compliance. OLHCHH also educates the general public about healthy homes through a public communications campaign to help people connect the dots between their health and their home.

The production of lead-safe housing units will continue to depend strongly on the level of funding for the lead hazard control grant programs and the rehabilitation programs that make required lead hazard reduction measures in assisted housing covered by the LSHR. With funding for OLHCHH grant activities projected to be approximately level through FY 2016, and the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and Home Investment Partnership Program (HOME) experiencing significant funding reductions in recent years, the number of pre-1978 housing units made lead-safe in 2016 is expected to decrease.

&amp;nbsp;

A total of 80,661 energy efficient and healthy units were reported for FY 2016, against the FY 2016 target of 79,537 units, and against the two-year FY 2016-17 APG target of 160,000 units. Of these, energy efficient completions reported through the fourth quarter (Q4) totaled&amp;nbsp;61,829 units, while healthy home completions totaled&amp;nbsp;18,832 units. The data available for Q4 of FY 2016&amp;nbsp;includes an estimated 13,208 annual Energy Performance Contract (EPC) units. This data is still being reviewed and will be revised if necessary for the&amp;nbsp;FY 2016 Annual Performance Report&amp;nbsp;in early 2017. HUD does not anticipate this total changing significantly.

Given the Department's robust FY 2016-17 APG target of 160,000, HUD has made significant progress. Moving forward, HUD's production volume will continue to be driven by FHA endorsements, the growing RAD production pipeline, and Energy Performance Contracts. Meanwhile, HUD has seen the production begin to wrap up for older projects (FY2010 NOFA funded 202/811 units;&amp;nbsp;Hope VI) and has discontinued other programs (PowerSaver;&amp;nbsp;Green Preservation Plus). Given this incremental decrease in direct &quot;green production&quot; activities, HUD will shift its focus in FY 2017 to strategies which 1) institutionalize energy and water reduction, such as utility benchmarking and improved building code requirements, and 2) increase the adoption and effectiveness of current programs, through more outreach and TA.

FY 2016-17 Energy-Related Units Completions by Program Office, through September 30, 2016:


	The Office of Community Planning and Development (CPD): CPD reported 8,708&amp;nbsp;energy efficient units in FY 2016, exceeding its year-one target by 1,057&amp;nbsp;energy efficient units. Completed CPD units consist of new HOME and Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)-funded units meeting the Energy Star Certified New Homes standard, as well as energy efficient CDBG-DR units built for Hurricane Sandy Disaster Relief. HUD also counts HOME units in California built to the Title 24 energy efficiency standard. (We are not currently tracking Title 24 non-Energy Star CDBG units) Although the HOME program saw its funding increase by $50 million from FY 2015 to FY 2016, this amount was still $50 million below the President’s budget request. Since FY 2010, the HOME program has seen its funding cut by over 50 percent. In light of these challenges, HUD has begun developing TA to help participating jurisdictions to identify local energy efficiency partners, incentives, and programs to make building to the Energy Star standard more attractive.&amp;nbsp;HUD expects CDBG-DR Sandy substantial rehabilitation projects to continue past 2020 given the pipeline of planned and recently underway projects.



	Housing: The Office of Housing completed 26,491 energy efficient units in FY 2016, over 4,500 short of its year-one target. The shortfall is primarily due to the Office of Multifamily Housing Programs’ RAD program, which continue to see a slower than expected adoption of Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) and the lingering impact of the previous production cap of 60,000 units. A RAD project is considered &quot;green&quot; if the conversion includes&amp;nbsp;LIHTC funding and takes place in states with passing Qualified Allocation Plan (QAP), as graded by Global Green USA. As a result of the 2015 appropriations act, HUD can now convert up to 185,000 units through RAD’s first component. Given the existing waitlist of projects and time needed to complete the conversion process, many of these “new” units won’t be counted towards the APG until 2017.


In addition to the RAD program, the following multifamily programs are included in this total: FHA Multifamily Endorsements with energy efficient features, the Mark-to-Market Program Green Initiative, Section 202 and Section 811 projects funded under the FY 2009 and FY 2010 NOFAs and completed in FY 2016. These 202/811 projects&amp;nbsp;required energy efficiency and water conservation measures and were encouraged to&amp;nbsp;use green building design and features. With over 10,700 units and growing, the strong pipeline of &quot;green&quot; FHA Multifamily Endorsements reflects the industry's positive response to the mortgage insurance premium (MIP) reduction first implemented in April 2016. HUD anticipates serving 40,000 families over the next three years through this incentive alone.

FHA’s Office of Single Family Housing reported 6,583 energy efficient units in FY 2016. The overwhelming majority of these units (6,382) were from the Section 203(k) mortgage program, which finance rehabilitation and home improvements in conjunction with home purchases (or refinancing of existing mortgages). Reporting for the&amp;nbsp;203(k) program operates on a significant delay, therefore HUD anticipated the final FY 2016 total to increase by hundreds of units by the next time HUD reports on progress (early 2017) due to completions that have yet to be manually entered into the system. The remaining single family housing units came from the Energy Efficient Mortgage (EEM) program.


	The Office of Public and Indian Housing (PIH): PIH reported 26,630 energy efficient units in FY 2016, well below the year-one target of 21,485. This total includes estimated&amp;nbsp;Energy Performance Contracts (EPC) units, which report in December of each year. Reported PIH units also include energy upgrades of existing public housing funded through the Public Housing Capital Fund (PHCF), counted as “unit equivalents”, as well as primarily new “developed energy efficient units” through mixed financing streams, HOPE VI, and Choice Neighborhoods.&amp;nbsp;The PHCF in particular saw a very successful year, highlighted by the New York City Housing Authority’s efforts to implement energy-saving measures across a number of large developments.&amp;nbsp;


FY 2016-17 Healthy Homes Units, through September 30, 2016:


	Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes (OLHCHH) and CPD: OLHCHH and CPD reported an estimated 18,832 units made lead safe in FY 2016. These include lead hazard interim control or abatement activities carried out by OLHCHH under lead hazard control grants as well as such activities carried out by CPD under the Lead Safe Housing Rule with HOME and CDBG funds. OLHCHH grantees work to mitigate environmental hazards for improved health outcomes in housing, prioritizing units where young children are present. In addition to reporting on a variety of lead hazard control and healthy housing grant programs, OLHCHH also reports data on its Lead Disclosure Rule enforcement actions. HUD expects to publish an update to the Lead Safe Housing Rule in Q2&amp;nbsp;FY 2017 that will lower the children’s blood lead level threshold at which owners of HUD-assisted housing promptly identify and control lead-based paint hazards. OLHCHH is preparing training and guidance efforts to support this rule change.

Depending upon the program, many grantees have&amp;nbsp;30+ days after the end of the quarter to provide HUD with their data. In addition to this 30-day window, program offices often require additional time to process and verify the data. Therefore, a complete record of completions by quarter is not generally available until at least 60-days after the close of the quarter.

Number of properties participating in utility data benchmarking (supporting indicator)

There is no HUD-wide&amp;nbsp;system for currently collecting and reporting utility data.&amp;nbsp;HUD is working to improve this indicator for the&amp;nbsp;FY 2017 Annual Performance Plan to align with HUD's internal benchmarking strategy. A PRA for this strategy&amp;nbsp;is currently in the public commenting period. Once the PRA process is complete, HUD will have a better idea of its annual&amp;nbsp;targets.&amp;nbsp;

Meanwhile, OLHCHH manages and funds lead hazard control and healthy housing retrofits, promoting tenant health and safety.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Housing and community development efforts must address a complex network of individual, social, economic, and environmental factors in order to promote more diverse, inclusive communities and improve the sustainability of neighborhoods, communities, and regions. Many of the neighborhoods hit hardest by the housing and economic crisis—those with the highest rates of foreclosure and job loss—have been racially isolated and among the least sustainable, with limited access to economic opportunity, the longest commuting times to jobs, the most homes that pose health risks, and the poorest quality schools.
It is crucial that the federal government and its local partners effectively coordinate policies related to community development, climate change, energy efficiency, transportation, and disaster preparedness. Today we know that “place” influences outcomes—the place where a person lives is a reliable predictor of his or her long-term health, education, and employment outcomes. Families and individuals living in concentrated poverty experience greater inequity and often, as a result, more dismal outcomes.
Residents of these neighborhoods have limited access to transportation, face health hazards in their homes and communities, suffer from the poorest schools, and have the fewest economic opportunities. In many areas, the spatial mismatch between housing and transportation investments limits access to decent employment and education opportunities for entire neighborhoods. This not only impacts the lives of residents in those communities, but the resulting need to travel greater distances to connect to these resources has a clear impact on the environment as well—from wetland and open space lost to sprawling development patterns to ever increasing greenhouse gas emissions.
To address these problems, Goal 4 focuses explicitly on “place;” on preparing communities for the future of their economy, environment, and community development, through enhanced planning, enforcement, and capacity building—so that all communities are livable for residents and viable in the long term.
</strategic_goal_overview><strategic_goal_sequence>4</strategic_goal_sequence></Strategic_Goal></Strategic_Goals><Strategic_Objectives><Strategic_Objective><id>1221</id><objective_header>Increase the health and safety of homes and embed comprehensive energy efficiency and healthy housing criteria across HUD programs.</objective_header><objective_statement>Increase the health and safety of homes and embed comprehensive energy efficiency and healthy housing criteria across HUD programs.
</objective_statement><objective_overview>HUD has committed to creating energy efficient, green, and healthy housing as part of a broader effort to foster the development of inclusive, sustainable communities. The residential sector is responsible for fully 21 percent of the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions.  With approximately 5.5 million housing units assisted through its rental assistance programs, HUD’s share of this total is significant. HUD spends an estimated $6.4 billion annually on utilities (both water and energy) in the form of allowances for tenant-paid utilities, direct operating grants for public housing, and housing assistance payments for privately-owned assisted housing. Utility costs account for around 22 percent of public housing operating budgets, and a similar share in the assisted housing sector. 
Reducing these rising costs—generating savings for residents and owners, as well as for taxpayers—is a key HUD priority. Significant progress has been made over the past five years with energy retrofits, healthy housing interventions, or new energy projects completed in more than 510,000 housing units. 
In FY 2016-17, HUD will continue or expand energy investments in the residential sector to support the goals of President Obama’s Climate Action Plan to cut energy waste in half by 2030 and accelerate clean energy leadership—both in HUD-assisted housing, as well as in market-rate housing. We will reduce barriers to financing energy efficiency as well as on-site renewable energy generation, help unlock innovative and traditional sources of capital, and strengthen codes and standards that promote energy efficiency and healthy housing.
The need to retrofit HUD-assisted housing is not limited to the efforts to increase energy efficiency and reduce costs. Housing is also an important determinant of health, and poor housing conditions are associated with a wide range of health conditions, including respiratory infections, asthma, lead poisoning, and injuries. HUD makes homes healthy and safe through several programs, led by the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes’ (OLHCHH) lead hazard control grant programs and Lead Safe Housing Rule (LSHR) compliance. OLHCHH also educates the general public about healthy homes through a public communications campaign to help people connect the dots between their health and their home. 
The production of lead-safe housing units will continue to depend strongly on the level of funding for the lead hazard control grant programs and the rehabilitation programs that make required lead hazard reduction measures in assisted housing covered by the LSHR. With funding for OLHCHH grant activities projected to be approximately level through FY 2016, and the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and Home Investment Partnership Program (HOME) experiencing significant funding reductions in recent years, the number of pre-1978 housing units made lead-safe in 2016 is expected to decrease.
