</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>The focus of this Agency Priority Goal (APG) is to enable economic growth concurrent with significant reductions in national emissions trajectories through 2020 and the longer term by supporting the development and implementation of low emission development strategies (LEDS).&amp;nbsp; Specifically, this APG measures the progress of Enhancing Capacity for Low Emission Development Strategies (EC-LEDS) and the multilateral Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP).

Through EC-LEDS, a multiagency U.S. Government team is working with partner countries to identify and advance effective economy-wide LEDS.

The LEDS Global Partnership is a multilateral platform for enhanced coordination, information exchange, and cooperation among countries and international programs working to advance low emission climate resilient growth that the U.S. State Department founded.

Low-emission, climate-resilient sustainable economic growth is highlighted as a U.S. diplomatic and development priority in the U.S. National Security Strategy, the President’s development policy, the President’s Climate Action Plan, and the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review.

The FY 2014-2015 Climate Change Agency Priority Goal (APG) states that by the end of 2015, U.S. bilateral assistance on Low Emission Development Strategies (LEDS) will reach at least 25 countries (from the previous baseline of 22 countries) and will result in the achievement of at least 45 major individual country milestones, each reflecting a significant, measurable improvement in that country’s development or implementation of LEDS.&amp;nbsp; Also by the end of 2015, at least 1,200 developing country government officials and practitioners (from a baseline of zero) will strengthen their LEDS capacity through participation in the LEDS Global Partnership and that capacity will be meaningfully applied in 25 countries (from a baseline of zero).

By the end of FY 2015, the U.S. Government exceeded this goal, with U.S. bilateral assistance reaching 26 countries and completing 46 APG milestones.&amp;nbsp; In addition to the 15 milestones achieved in FY 2014, U.S. Government-supported LEDS programs achieved 31 additional milestones in FY 2015 with U.S. Government assistance; consisting of 21 milestones for LEDS development (including 11 milestones on Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) development) and 10 milestones for LEDS implementation.&amp;nbsp; The LEDS Global Partnership also exceeded its APG target, strengthening the LEDS capacity of 4,796 country officials and practitioners who meaningfully applied that enhanced capacity in 27 countries (13 in FY 2014 and 14 in FY 2015).

&amp;nbsp;

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Department of State (State) achieved these milestones by the deadline of October 1, 2015, through reporting submitted by USAID missions and other partners to the Enhancing Capacity for LEDS (EC-LEDS) database that is maintained by the Global Climate Change (GCC) office in USAID’s Bureau for Bureau for Economic Growth, Education, and Environment (E3).&amp;nbsp; USAID and State achieved these results as the international community prepared to seek an international climate agreement at the United Nations climate negotiations in Paris (i.e. the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP 21)) in December 2015.&amp;nbsp; U.S. assistance on LEDS helped to foster an environment of productive collaboration and motivation to make progress on international climate solutions during this critical time.

Looking ahead to the FY 2016-2017 APG, by the end of FY 2017, U.S. bilateral assistance under LEDS will reach a minimum of 26 countries and achieve at least 100 major individual country milestones (from a baseline of 46), each reflecting a significant, measurable improvement in that country’s development or implementation of LEDS.

To meet the overall goal of 100 milestones, USAID and State will need to achieve an additional 54 milestones by the end of FY 2017 (23 in FY 2016 and 31 in FY 2017).&amp;nbsp;

Explanation of Results

The FY 2014-2015 GCC APG exceeded its milestone target, achieving 46 major country milestones by the end of FY 2015.&amp;nbsp; This success was a combination of two key factors.&amp;nbsp; First, the dedication of Enhancing Capacity for Low Emission Development Strategies (EC-LEDS) partner country missions to move this work forward within their country contexts was a crucial component of success.&amp;nbsp; Countries were especially motivated to demonstrate progress during this period as they prepared for COP 21.&amp;nbsp; Second, these results directly correlate to a massive inter and intra-agency collaboration effort to both develop and report against APG milestones in partnership with USAID missions.&amp;nbsp; The USAID GCC technical team, in collaboration with USAID regional bureau POCs, and the State Department’s climate change team worked continuously with missions to refine and strengthen proposed milestones.&amp;nbsp; The proposed milestones focus on outcome-based country results and achievements to which U.S.-supported programs made a significant contribution. Expert review teams validate completed milestones against concrete evidence, ensuring that targets and results represent transformative country actions, and are anchored by sound data at the time of reporting.

USAID and State, define a “major milestone” as the establishment, adoption, or significant improvement in essential LEDS components or building blocks in a partner country.&amp;nbsp; These building blocks may include, but are not limited to:&amp;nbsp; plans, strategies, greenhouse gas inventories or accounting systems, analytical tools, institutional arrangements, greenhouse gas registries, or monitoring, reporting and verification systems.

Below are three examples of milestones achieved under the LEDS development indicator:


	India – National monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) system for forest carbon and forest condition developed and demonstrated.


In FY 2015, Forest-PLUS helped India achieve a stable MRV system design and full field demonstration. Through the Forest-PLUS program, USAID has catalyzed the development of an integrated MRV system that combines a nationally focused system with various previously incompatible state systems. USAID has provided support to Government of India’s Forest Survey of India and four State Forest Departments to design the system.&amp;nbsp; By developing, demonstrating, and later institutionalizing an efficient, integrated MRV system, this support has provided a mechanism and a trajectory for Indian institutions to coordinate on forestry data and help India meet the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Measurement, Reporting, and Verification requirement.


	Peru – Transport Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA) developed.


Applying a peer-to-peer and collaborative approach, the Low Emission Development Strategy Global Partnership (LEDS GP) Transport Working Group organized a series of technical workshops on LEDS methodologies with peer experts from Colombia and Mexico and provided additional technical support to build the capacity of the Peruvian Ministries of Environment, Transport, and Energy and Mines.&amp;nbsp; The Peruvian Ministries of Environment and Transport, with support from LEDS GP and other partners, developed and funded Peru’s Transport NAMA.&amp;nbsp; With only some of the measures considered, the NAMA will reduce emissions by five million tons CO2e from 2015-2025 and will result in reduced congestion and better access to public transportation.


	Colombia – Government of Colombia developed and submitted their Post-2020 Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), with USG assistance.


Under the framework of the Low Carbon Development Strategy process, Colombia designed their INDC and submitted it to the UNFCCC. Enhancing Capacity for Low Emission Development Strategies (EC-LEDS), through the Low Carbon Resilient Development Program, supported the technical process with specific studies to provide a range of possible greenhouse gas emission reduction goals in the agriculture, transport, and housing sectors.&amp;nbsp; Sectoral ministries that have approved Sectoral Mitigation Action Plans based those inputs on a bottom-up approach that feeds into sectoral decision-making related to the INDC.

For the LEDS implementation indicator, a “major milestone” is an event, output, or outcome that shows a partner country is achieving significant progress in implementing its LEDS that results in, is expected to result in, and/or establishes the necessary pre-conditions for emissions reductions.&amp;nbsp; Improvements that may be considered “major” include, but are not limited to: significant measured GHG reductions from business as usual; finance mobilized and funds established for mitigation actions; additional clean energy generation capacity installed; reductions in the conversion or degradation of ecosystems that are significant carbon sinks; and laws, policies, or regulations enacted or promulgated; or country-level renewable energy targets met or land based carbon sequestration targets met.

Below are three examples of milestones achieved under the LEDS implementation indicator:

&amp;nbsp;


	Asia Regional – Over $150 million (USD) mobilized from private and public sources for clean energy investments in Asia, as a result of U.S. Government assistance.


In FY 2015 alone, U.S. Government support mobilized more than $150 million for clean energy investment in countries in Asia through the USAID-supported Climate Technology Initiative Private Finance Advisory Network (CTI PFAN).&amp;nbsp; This financing includes $13.4 million in India for investment in clean electric scooters and renewable energy; $12.6 million in Thailand for biomass; $10 million in Indonesia for LED street lights; and more than $102 million in Vietnam for wind energy.&amp;nbsp; CTI PFAN is a multilateral public private partnership that connects clean energy businesses and projects with private sector financing.&amp;nbsp; Through its network of private sector consultants, CTI PFAN provides targeted professional support, advice, and technical assistance to selected projects on the preparation of commercially viable, sustainable, and climate-friendly business models for introduction to investors.


	Indonesia – Strategic Environmental Assessments developed and implemented for 11 districts in Indonesia, reducing more than four million metric tons CO2e.


Over the past five years, USAID, through the Indonesia Forest and Climate Support Program (IFACS) has supported the development of 11 district-level Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEAs) across five priority landscapes.&amp;nbsp; These SEAs are required analyses that inform district-level development planning by identifying forested and biodiversity-rich lands within district boundaries that can be better managed and protected. These USAID supported SEAs have resulted in approximately 561,000 total hectares of tropical forests being set aside by districts for conservation. IFACS resulted in 4,425,000 tons of carbon emissions avoided from deforestation and land use change.


	India – Replicable model for rooftop solar deployment, with high potential to accelerate achievement of India’s National Solar Mission, implemented by State utility


In FY 2015, Karnataka launched its Solar Policy with support from the U.S. Government. Through it, Bangalore Electricity Supply Company Ltd. (BESCOM), the state’s largest public distribution utility has set an ambitious target to deploy 100 MW of rooftop solar annually over four years (four percent of the national 2018 target).&amp;nbsp; When India achieves this target, they will reduce 484 million tons CO2e annually.&amp;nbsp; The USG supported BESCOM to address key structural gaps in the market eco-system, i.e. interconnection procedures and permitting requirements. The policy establishes an institutional framework to scale up deployment of rooftop solar that could be replicated nationally in other utilities (i.e., open-source procedures).

Challenges and Opportunities

&amp;nbsp;

Following the approval of the streamlining committee, USAID and State streamlined and improved the APG data collection process with the introduction of the EC-LEDS database that houses milestone data and supporting program information, such as country theories of change and implementing mechanism information.&amp;nbsp; The database was extremely helpful in streamlining data collection and eliminating the use of multiple google spreadsheets.&amp;nbsp; However, as is typically the case with introducing new processes and tools, the first round of proposing and reporting against milestones via the database had some technical and logistical difficulties.&amp;nbsp; By making incremental improvements to the database and working closely and collaboratively with USAID missions, USAID and State overcame many of these obstacles and made improvements to the processes.

Coordinating the review and validation of proposed and completed milestones remains a challenge, as it is time and labor intensive and requires active participation from USAID, State, and missions.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, the timing of the data collection process presents a challenge for operating units since it comes at the end of the fiscal year, before most of the implementing mechanisms are required to report their year-end results to USAID missions for entry into the Foreign Assistance Coordination and Tracking System (FACTS) database. &amp;nbsp;USAID and State Department teams in Washington will continue to communicate with missions in a clear and timely manner to overcome these challenges.

While U.S. Government assistance plays a major role in laying the groundwork for the achievement of major milestones, the full realization of these milestones is often beyond direct U.S. Government control.&amp;nbsp; Due to the outcome-based, country-owned nature of the major milestones, ultimate achievement of these milestones often relies on actions on the part of partner governments or their designated institutions.&amp;nbsp; These actions are beyond the control of USAID and State climate change development assistance programs.&amp;nbsp; Thus, it can also be difficult to predict if country milestones will be achieved due to unforeseen circumstances (for example, natural disasters, political issues, etc.).&amp;nbsp; State and USAID work to navigate this issue by maintaining constant communication with missions and an awareness of evolving country circumstances.

&amp;nbsp;

As this work moves forward, it will be challenging to maintain the level of momentum and accomplishment in an uncertain budget environment.&amp;nbsp; The success of this program relies on Global Climate Change Initiative funding reaching partner countries through both bilateral and multilateral channels.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, future investments in the 26 EC-LEDS partner countries and LEDS Global Partnership are critical for successful performance in the FY 2016-2017 goal.

One significant opportunity is the increased momentum and motivation from a successful international climate agreement reached at COP 21 in Paris.&amp;nbsp; Nearly 200 countries came together to reach this agreement in December 2015.&amp;nbsp; USAID and State will strive to make strong linkages between LEDS assistance and outcomes of the Paris Agreement, including helping countries implement their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and submit subsequent NDCs every five years, continue to measure and report on their greenhouse gas emissions through robust and transparent inventories, and develop national long-term, mid-century LEDS by 2020.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Climate change is a real and imminent threat to core U.S. interests and to the global economy.  The scientific consensus is that greenhouse gases are causing higher land temperatures, warming oceans, raising average sea levels, and creating more extreme heat waves and storms.  These changes are leading to declines in agricultural productivity, exacerbating water scarcity, causing losses of biodiversity, and amplifying humanitarian crises that risk undermining the social, economic, and political stability of our allies and partners.  Climate change disproportionately affects the most vulnerable, threatens to reverse hard-won development gains, and works against U.S. interests worldwide – namely peace and stability, poverty alleviation, food security, and economic development.  It is in America’s vital interest to lead in the global fight against climate change by taking aggressive, smart, and effective action. 
Sustainable and secure sources of energy are fundamental to global economic growth, prosperity, and stability.  Global energy demand is expected to increase nearly 40 percent by 2030, with more than 90 percent of that increase occurring in developing and emerging market countries.  Without effective action, this increasing demand will lead to greater emissions causing further climate change.
Under the President’s Climate Action Plan, we are investing at home to cut emissions from power plants, unlocking long-term investment in clean energy innovation, and building resilience to climate change in our communities.  Internationally, we are leading efforts to forge a new agreement that applies to all countries starting in 2020.  We are encouraging the safe, responsible transition to cleaner fuels such as natural gas, fostering investment, encouraging innovation in renewable technologies, and thereby creating opportunities for U.S. businesses.  We are supporting countries in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from their forests and their land.  And we are using diplomatic tools and development resources to reduce the likelihood of even more dangerous climate change in the future and to prepare vulnerable nations for climate impacts that will be unavoidable. 
For the State Department and USAID, promoting the transition to a low-emission, climate-resilient world while expanding global access to sustainable energy is central to our mission.  We are committed to addressing climate change in a way that permits all countries to prosper.  We understand that this requires a fundamental shift in the way the world uses land and produces, consumes, and distributes energy, while maintaining economic growth.  We are also working to encourage responsible resource management by promoting global transparency standards to ensure energy producing countries are well-governed. 
Energy and climate change shape political, economic, environmental, and security developments within and among countries.  The global energy sector is undergoing dramatic change.  Technologies such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling are altering the global energy landscape, with the Western Hemisphere becoming increasingly important as a source of production.  Renewable energy costs have plummeted in recent years.  Due to burgeoning domestic production of unconventional gas and oil, the United States will become a net exporter of natural gas.  Our oil imports are at their lowest level in 20 years.  Energy efficiency and conservation programs with strong bipartisan support, such as improvements in vehicle fuel efficiency, continue to reduce our petroleum demand.
Even as the United States reduces its reliance on imported oil and gas and encourages a transition to renewable energy, increased energy demand from emerging markets continues to drive global demand for hydrocarbons.  As we seek to transition from traditional energy resources, the world still needs a stable supply of energy, including security to the lines of transportation and a reasonable price for oil and gas.  This security underpins stability in the global economy and helps mitigate resource-driven security risks.

Internationally, as a result of recent progress in negotiations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the international climate regime now reflects pledges through 2020 by more than 80 countries constituting about 80 percent of global emissions, including the world’s major emitters, and holds countries accountable for their actions through regular and robust reporting and reviews.  In December 2015, the 195 countries party to the UNFCCC are to conclude a new agreement addressing the global climate response in the post-2020 era.  This will be a major milestone in the effort to combat climate change over the next two decades.  Simultaneously, we will enhance engagement bilaterally, plurilaterally, and multilaterally to deliver results that will contribute to an ambitious and effective global response to climate change, through 2020 and beyond.
External factors that could affect our efforts include negotiating stances of other countries and domestic actions some countries take to combat climate change.  The private sector plays a major role, as investment decisions such as the choice of technologies for new power generation and design of new cars and trucks can have a climate impact for years to come.  Also, partnering with countries to encourage a low-emissions development path will be more successful when working with foreign governments that make combating climate change a priority.
Strategies for Achieving the Objective
Through the President’s Climate Action Plan, the President’s Global Climate Change Initiative, and USAID’s Climate Change and Development Strategy, the United States has made low-emissions, climate-resilient sustainable economic growth a priority in our diplomacy and development.  Our efforts involve two major areas of engagement:  (1) lowering the atmospheric accumulation rate of greenhouse gases that cause climate change; and (2) helping societies anticipate and incorporate plans for responding to potential climate change impacts.  The United States is leading efforts to address climate change through international climate negotiations while enhancing multilateral and bilateral engagement with major economies.  It is also enhancing partnerships with other key countries and regions.  The U.S. is focusing its efforts on actions that support a successful global approach to climate change, as reflected in discussions leading up to the Paris climate conference in 2015, and for subsequent United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) sessions.  These efforts deliver results that contribute to an ambitious and effective global response to climate change to the year 2020 and beyond.
The U.S. is building partnerships to reduce emissions of short-lived climate pollutants and from deforestation.  For example, the U.S. works to secure a global phase-down of hydro-fluoro-carbons through the Montreal Protocol.  If implemented, this could reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by 90 gigatons of CO2 equivalent by 2050.  The U.S. is also building capacity for countries to undertake low-emission development policies.  This work includes assisting countries to increase their capacity for cross-sector planning and formulating sectoral policies for low-emissions growth.  Other efforts aim to expand clean energy generation and transmission and to increase energy efficiency while phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption.  This requires mobilizing public and private investments in cleaner energy, implementing enhanced land-use practices, and building public-private partnerships that reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation.
The Department of State and USAID’s climate-smart agriculture efforts involve implementing technologies that increase climate resilience and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  State and USAID are also working to promote sustainable land uses, which combine climate change mitigation and resilience with long-term growth.  Additionally, State and USAID support adaptation planning processes in vulnerable countries and communities by developing support tools that use climate science and improve access to data.  These integrate climate data into planning decisions. They also strengthen public participation in climate change planning, especially by women, vulnerable populations, indigenous groups, and minorities.  State and USAID back actions that increase climate resilience with respect to water security, land management, disaster planning, financial risk management, and management of biodiversity and natural resources.
The United States supports bilateral and multilateral programs by working with the most vulnerable communities, least developed and developing nations, and the major greenhouse gas emitters.  Among the programs and efforts to achieve their overall climate change objectives, State and USAID have chosen to highlight efforts to support Low Emission Development Strategies (LEDS) as a cross-cutting Agency Priority Goal.  Through LEDS assistance, State and USAID seek to guide policy-makers in analyzing, formulating, and making policy decisions enabling them to develop along a lower emission pathway, which contributes to greenhouse gas reduction efforts.  The main program for providing LEDS Assistance, the Enhancing Capacity for LEDS (EC-LEDS) program is a unique State and USAID partnership that blends their respective strengths in diplomacy and development.  EC-LEDS stands as a key element of U.S. climate assistance, alongside their critical efforts including:  (1) the Major Economies Forum; (2) Clean Energy Ministerial; (3) Climate and Clean Air Coalition; (4) Tropical Forest Alliance (TFA)2020; and (5) a range of multilateral funds, such as the Clean Investment Funds and funds focusing on adaptation such as the Least Developed Countries Fund and the Special Climate Change Fund.
