</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>In alignment with OPM FY 2014-2018 Strategic Plan Goal 8.0, OPM provides personnel background investigative services to determine individuals’ suitability for Federal civilian, military, and contract employment and eligibility for access to classified national security information. OPM performs these background investigations for Federal agencies on a fee-for-service basis and conducts more than 95 percent of all background investigations for the Federal Government.&amp;nbsp; The timeliness provisions of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 and the Director of National Intelligence continue to be a key focus of the background investigations program.&amp;nbsp; OPM will continue efforts to complete the fastest 90 percent of all initial national security investigations initial within an average of 40 days, and the fastest 90 percent of all initial Top Secret investigations within an average of 80 days, and the fastest 90 percent of all initial Secret/Confidential investigations within an average of 40 days, as required by the Director of National Intelligence. &amp;nbsp;However, when the agency decided in FY 2014 not to renew the terms of one of its key investigative contractors, OPM’s Federal Investigative Services was challenged to continue to provide high-quality background investigations in a timely manner to its Federal agency customers with far fewer and less experienced contractor resources.&amp;nbsp;

In 2015, in light of increasing cybersecurity threats, including the compromise of information housed at OPM, the interagency Suitability and Security Clearance Performance Accountability Council (PAC) conducted a 90-Day Suitability and Security review to re-examine reforms to the Federal background investigations process, assess additional enhancements to further secure information networks and systems, and determine improvements that could be made to the way the Government conducts background investigations for suitability, security and credentialing. As a result of that review, a new Federal entity, the National Background Investigations Bureau (NBIB), would be established to create a more secure and effective Federal background investigations infrastructure.&amp;nbsp;On October 1, 2016, the NBIB began operation with the critical mission to deliver efficient and effective background investigations to safeguard the integrity and trustworthiness of the Federal workforce.&amp;nbsp; OPM stood up the NBIB without interruption to the crucially important investigative services OPM is tasked with providing.

&amp;nbsp;

The NBIB will strengthen current and future investigative delivery, enhances stakeholder engagement, facilitates innovation, and engages both the Federal and private sectors in providing feedback, setting priorities, and ensuring continuous improvement.&amp;nbsp;Some of the highlights of the NBIB include (1) an interagency detailee program to enable NBIB ready access to national security expertise from across Government and to expand ongoing interagency participation in the NBIB decision making process and operational activities, (2) a Business Transformation Directorate to increase the use of data, analytics, technology and innovative solutions to improve the quality and timeliness of processes, and (3) improvements to OPM’s existing customer service with expanded functions.&amp;nbsp; In September 2016, OPM named Charles S. Phalen, Jr. as the Director of the NBIB.&amp;nbsp;

In addition, the NBIB will be accountable to the PAC and the NBIB’s customer agencies for providing continuous improvements to the investigative process.&amp;nbsp; The PAC and the Performance Improvement Council will also develop, implement, and continuously re-evaluate and revise outcome-based metrics that measure the effectiveness of the entire vetting processes, including investigations.&amp;nbsp; By the end of calendar year 2016, mechanisms and measures for continuous improvements to the investigative process will be identified and incorporated into subsequent APG updates. &amp;nbsp;

	OPM will deliver full capability for all tiers of the 2012 Federal Investigation Standards by the end of FY 2017.&amp;nbsp;
	The agency will also implement executive branch-wide quality standards. OPM made the Quality Assessment Reporting Tool available to Executive Branch agencies in November 2016.&amp;nbsp; In December 2016, the agency will work with ODNI to evaluate the quality data.&amp;nbsp;
	OPM is working with the Performance Accountability Council Project Management Office and the Performance Improvement Council on an ongoing effort to develop, implement, and continuously re-evaluate and revise outcome-based measures to gauge the effectiveness of the background investigations process.
	The agency will continue to execute initiatives to increase capacity to improve timeliness and decrease the current backlog of investigations.&amp;nbsp; These include hiring of an additional 200 Federal field investigators in FY 2017.


</next_steps><progress_update>
	On October 1, 2015, OPM implemented the Tier 3 and the Tier 3 Reinvestigation products.&amp;nbsp; The new products are based on the 2012 Federal Investigative Standards.&amp;nbsp; OPM will assess the impact of the Tier 3 and the Tier 3 Reinvestigation products on timeliness throughout FY 2016.
	On October 1, 2016, OPM launched the Tiers 4 and 5 investigation products for high risk and top secret clearance determinations.
	In October 2015, OPM published a Federal Investigations Notice (FIN) announcing its products and service pricing for FY 2016.&amp;nbsp;
	Beginning in the second quarter of FY 2016, OPM began the process to hire 400 additional Federal investigators.&amp;nbsp; At the end of the fourth quarter, FIS had hired 363 new Federal investigators.&amp;nbsp; An additional 34 Federal investigators were in the investigation pipeline and were brought on board October 16, 2016.&amp;nbsp; In all, a total of 400 job offers were extended to qualified job candidates.
	To counter the loss of one of the FIS contractors in FY 2014, OPM continued to work with its two remaining fieldwork contractors to increase their production. &amp;nbsp;In addition, in September 2016, OPM awarded contracts to two additional fieldwork contractors, further expanding its investigation capacity.&amp;nbsp;
	Actions taken to expand investigative capacity were within budget constraints, and maintained the current high quality of OPM’s investigations. &amp;nbsp;

</progress_update><themes><theme>General Government</theme></themes><contributing_programs_and_other_factors>OPM’s Federal Investigative Services (FIS) is the primary program executing this goal.&amp;nbsp; FIS will be supported by other OPM organizations that will assist in such areas as information technology development and operations (the Chief Information Officer), legal advice (Office of the General Counsel), definition of HR data standards (Planning and Policy Analysis and HR Line of Business), and budgeting and financial operations (Chief Financial Officer).

The Office of the General Counsel will support reform of suitability, national security, credentialing, and other investigative and related adjudicative processes relating to the concept of fitness by providing input to the 120-day OMB review, supporting the subsequent implementation of the recommendations through the PAC process, and providing other services as needed.

Success of this strategy depends on an external factor--outcome of Justice Department proceedings with OPM investigative contractors.&amp;nbsp; Depending upon the result of current Justice Department actions, FIS may need to adapt its contractor and Federal investigation workforce.

As the Executive Agent for Suitability, OPM partners with the Executive Agent for Security, Director of National Intelligence to develop and implement national policy impacting the personal security/suitability investigations program.&amp;nbsp; Examples include the new Federal investigative standards, reciprocity, and improved quality standards.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>The integrity of the federal workforce is enhanced through the review of the suitability of individual applicants, ongoing reviews of federal employees, and the oversight of agency human resource systems that promote fairness and merit in all hiring and assessment processes. 
As the Suitability Executive Agent, the Director of OPM is responsible for ensuring that those whom agencies select and retain to serve the United States Government and the American people are fit to serve.  To do this, we must develop and implement consistent, uniform policies, tools, and processes for determinations of suitability, assignment to sensitive positions, and access to Federal facilities’ and information systems.  Executing these responsibilities encompasses the collection of background investigation information.  OPM’s activity in support of this goal helps protect our national security and provides the American people a reliable and responsible employee team they can trust in fulfilling important government functions. 
OPM is mandated by statute to ensure delegated human resource authorities are carried out in accordance with merit system principles and OPM standards. In addition, Executive Order 13197 (Government-wide Accountability for Merit System Principles; Workforce Information) authorizes OPM to hold Executive departments and agencies accountable to the President for effective human capital management.
