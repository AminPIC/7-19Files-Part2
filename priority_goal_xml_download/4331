</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>High-speed and intercity passenger rail represents an innovative approach to addressing the complex 21st century transportation challenges facing the United States. By 2050, the U.S. population will likely increase by more than 100 million people. Highway and airport congestion are increasing, with related severe economic and environmental impacts. To address these challenges and strengthen the country’s competitive position in an increasingly global economy, the U.S. Department of Transportation has a comprehensive program to develop high-speed and intercity passenger rail. The Federal Railroad Administration&amp;nbsp;manages an approximately $20 billion grant and loan portfolio focused on:


	Building new high-speed rail corridors that expand and fundamentally improve passenger transportation in the geographic regions they serve;
	Upgrading existing intercity passenger rail corridors to improve reliability, speed, and frequency of existing services; and
	Laying the groundwork, through corridor and state planning, for future high-speed rail services.


For the High-Speed and Intercity Passenger Rail Program, FRA selected 153 projects across the country, with nearly 85 percent of rail investments concentrated in 6 corridors (San Francisco-Los Angeles, Boston-New York City-Washington, D.C., Seattle-Portland-Eugene, Charlotte-Washington, D.C., Chicago-St. Louis, and Chicago-Detroit). These corridors are in five mega-regions, in which about 65 percent of the U.S. population resides and which will likely absorb the bulk of future population growth.

FRA has developed a sophisticated grants management apparatus, laid the foundation for sustainable long-term passenger rail improvements, and strengthened industry capacity to deliver rail projects through technical assistance and strategic initiatives. FRA is strongly committed to robust stakeholder outreach, communication, and collaboration as central components of program management, allowing FRA to identify program improvements, engage in project planning and development, and provide the support necessary for grantees to carry out projects successfully.

Progress: FRA and its grantees exceeded the cumulative construction initiation goal and the project completion goal for the 2014 to 2015 agency priority goal cycle, with 67 projects achieving initial construction and 75 projects substantially complete by the end of the fourth quarter of 2015.


	In Q4, FRA grantees in Maryland, Oregon, Washington, and the District of Columbia reached completion of four projects, exceeding the fourth quarter project completion goal.&amp;nbsp; FRA worked closely with the grantees to finalize and approve project deliverables by the end of the quarter.


Obstacles to Achievable Goal and Stretch Target: Planning, constructing, and operating high-speed and intercity passenger rail projects require the cooperation and concurrence of many stakeholders. Reaching agreement among states, service operators, and private railroads takes time and significant resources. Construction of these projects is technically complex. Predicting the amount of time projects need to fulfill post-award and pre-construction requirements can be difficult for complex infrastructure projects due to the large number of unknowns and stakeholders involved. Nevertheless, FRA is on track to achieve its targets for the 2014 to 2015 agency priority goal cycle.FRA has exceeded its 2015 fourth quarter construction initiation target (65 projects) and met its project completion target by the end of the quarter (74 projects).

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Our goal is to support the U.S. economy by fostering strategic investments that will serve the traveling public and facilitate freight movement now and in the future. Transportation enables economic activity, quality of life, connected communities, and ladders of opportunity to education, opportunities, and services. In order to support the lives and economies of neighborhoods, regions, and the Nation, we must invest wisely in transportation. Our central strategies for achieving maximum economic returns on our policies and investments include leading the development of intercity, high-speed passenger rail and a competitive air transportation system; increasing travel time reliability in freight-significant highway corridors; improving the performance of freight rail and maritime networks; advancing transportation interests in targeted markets around the world; expanding opportunities in the transportation sector for small businesses; and creating a dynamic workforce.

</objective_statement><objective_overview>Based on current economic and demographic forecasts, it is likely that the movement of people and goods within the U.S. and abroad will continue to increase and the transportation sector will continue to enable economic growth and job creation.  The transportation sector contributed approximately $1.466 trillion, or 9.7 percent, to GDP in 2011.  Our Nation must make strategic investments that enable the movement of people and goods more efficiently with full utilization of the existing capacity across all transportation modes. The cornerstones of this strategy are investments in high-performance passenger rail, the development of a national freight strategy, investments in public transportation, mitigating traffic congestion on our highways, and implementing NextGen to improve operations and alleviate airport congestion.
