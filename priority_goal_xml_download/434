</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Approximately 840 million people in the world remain hungry today, and 98 percent of them live in developing countries.&amp;nbsp; In addition, the world’s population is projected to increase to nine billion by 2050.&amp;nbsp; This population increase and changes in diets will require at least a 60 percent increase in global food production, all in a world that will have less arable land and less access to water under changing climate patterns.

Improving food security has risen to prominence as a global development goal in recent years due to factors such as food price spikes, increasing poverty rates, and social unrest related to poverty and hunger.&amp;nbsp; At the G-8 Summit in L’Aquila, Italy, in July 2009, global leaders—including President Obama—agreed to take significant action to improve food security through agricultural development and reforms to the way the international community approaches food security.&amp;nbsp; The U.S. committed at least $3.5 billion and other countries committed over $18 billion through 2012.&amp;nbsp; In May 2012, at the Camp David G-8 Summit with African heads of state and corporate and G-8 leaders, President Obama again led global food security efforts by launching the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition for Africa, a shared goal to achieving sustained and inclusive agricultural growth and raising 50 million people out of poverty by 2022.

&amp;nbsp;

The Feed the Future initiative is the U.S. Government’s contribution to the global effort launched by President Obama at L’Aquila.&amp;nbsp; Feed the Future&amp;nbsp;works with the global community, strengthening coordination with other donors and stakeholders, to:


	Advance comprehensive, country-led strategies that focus on accountability and improving the productivity and market access of small-scale producers, particularly women, who make up the majority of small farmers in developing countries;
	Catalyze private sector economic growth, finance, and trade with necessary investments in public goods as well as policy, legal, and regulatory reforms;
	Use science and technology to sustainably increase agricultural productivity;
	Protect the natural resource base upon which agriculture depends;
	Build resilience and help to prevent recurrent food crises in vulnerable regions; and
	Invest in improving nutrition for women and young children as a foundation for future growth.


&amp;nbsp;

Feed the Future&amp;nbsp;is well-positioned to support the U.S. Government’s aim to promote inclusive economic growth, reduce extreme poverty, and improve food security, as outlined in the State Department-USAID Joint Strategic Plan.

With a clear focus on fighting poverty, hunger, and undernutrition, President Obama launched the global hunger and food security initiative called Feed the Future as one of the first foreign policy acts of his presidency.&amp;nbsp; The United States pledged $3.5 billion to this effort over three years, which helped leverage an additional $18.5 billion in support from G-8 members and other donors.&amp;nbsp; Led by USAID and drawing on the resources and expertise of 10 additional federal departments and agencies, Feed the Future is now delivering results that are changing the face of poverty and hunger for some of the world’s poorest families.

Feed the Future is demonstrating country-level results that positively impact millions of households.&amp;nbsp; In FY 2015, Feed the Future exceeded its APG target of reaching eight million farmers and food producers with new technologies and management practices by over a million.&amp;nbsp; Further details on Feed the Future’s whole-of-government results are available on the Feed the Future website.

For the performance indicator on Feed the Future funds disbursed, USAID exceeded the FY 2014 quarterly target and was within a few percentage points of the target for all other quarterly targets.&amp;nbsp; For example, USAID finished FY 2015 by disbursing $2.51 billion, narrowly missing the target of $2.53 billion.

USAID met all its APG quarterly milestones for the FY 2014 – 2015 reporting period.&amp;nbsp; Milestones included: 1) Making data sets related to food security available to the public; 2) promoting and coordinating knowledge-sharing events to ensure case studies, best practices, and lessons learned are widely shared across the Feed the Future partners and throughout the wider development community; 3) holding portfolio reviews of activities to review mission programming and performance; and 4) tracking senior level speaking engagements to ensure USAID remains engaged with partners on critical food security issues.

&amp;nbsp;

Explanation of Results

Feed the Future was slightly below its annual target of reaching seven million farmers and others in FY 2014, but exceeded its target of eight million in FY 2015, reaching over nine million farmers and producers.&amp;nbsp; The data for this indicator come from the Feed the Future Monitoring System and reflects the total number of direct beneficiary producers who have applied improved technologies or management practices (such as use of improved/certified seed varieties, drip irrigation, low- or no-till practices, and integrated soil fertility management) as a result of U.S. Government assistance.&amp;nbsp; A large portion of this increase is due to on-going efforts to scale best practices and proven improved technologies.

USAID was consistently shy of reaching its quarterly targets for the amount of Feed the Future funds disbursed.&amp;nbsp; However, in quarter four of FY 2015, the Agency achieved 99.3 percent of its target.&amp;nbsp; Feed the Future continues to make concerted efforts to close programmatic gaps, including supporting the use of improved practices and technological innovations to improve productivity and nutrition; empowering women to realize their potential as farmers and entrepreneurs; assisting communities become more resilient to natural and man-made stresses and shocks; supporting key infrastructure, such as roads and irrigation projects; connecting smallholders to financial services and markets; and helping governments and regional institutions develop policies that promote good nutrition and inclusive economic growth.&amp;nbsp; These efforts to expand the reach of our programming help to ensure funds are disbursed in a timely manner.

&amp;nbsp;

Challenges and Opportunities 

While Feed the Future’s collective progress has been impressive, the world must remain focused on meeting the challenge of improving global food security and nutrition among the world’s poorest.&amp;nbsp; In July 2016, President Obama signed into law the Global Food Security Act of 2016, a bipartisan piece of legislation.&amp;nbsp; This law sends a clear message that the United States is committed to empowering small farmers, and strengthening communities and economies through agricultural development.&amp;nbsp; The legislation reinforces the U.S. Government’s successful approach to increasing food security and nutrition through the Feed the Future initiative.&amp;nbsp; It also codifies the U.S. Government’s commitment to the productivity, incomes, and livelihoods, of small-scale producers, particularly women.&amp;nbsp; It does so by working across agricultural value chains and expanding farmers’ access to local and international markets.&amp;nbsp; Moving forward, USAID will continue to work with partners to improve&amp;nbsp;lasting food security, nutrition, economic growth, and resilience.&amp;nbsp; This will help build a more secure future and make progress toward ending poverty, hunger, and malnutrition.

With respect to the APG, the indicator “Amount of Feed the Future funds disbursed since 2010,”&amp;nbsp; which specifically tracks&amp;nbsp;USAID disbursements against the President's government-wide pledge of $3.5 billion over three years for&amp;nbsp;the L’Aquila Food Security Initiative.&amp;nbsp; USAID’s contribution to the L’Aquila pledge comprises obligations from FY 2010 – FY 2012 resources. &amp;nbsp;This indicator is not representative of all Food Security disbursement efforts as it does not track additional annual funding supporting agriculture and food security efforts appropriated and obligated in subsequent years.

Although the Agency was consistently within a few percentage points of the target, in a few cases, humanitarian crises hindered program implementation and affected USAID’s ability to achieve disbursement targets (e.g., coup in Mali, Ebola crisis).&amp;nbsp; This indicator helps to track Feed the Future’s ability to program, implement, and scale food security activities.&amp;nbsp; Feed the Future missions have continued to make concerted efforts to close programmatic gaps, scale promising technologies, and expand the reach of interventions to more smallholders, helping to ensure funds are disbursed in a timely manner.&amp;nbsp;

Although USAID achieved its target for the number of farmers and producers reached in FY 2015, this indicator only counts Feed the Future beneficiaries actively engaged in programs.&amp;nbsp; Farmers still applying improved technologies or practices after they are no longer a beneficiary are not counted.&amp;nbsp; While overall reporting figures may shift in future years, it does not necessarily reflect the full reach and impact of Feed the Future activities to assist farmers to utilize new and improved technologies.

The Food Security APG is one of USAID's FY 2016-2017 APGs.

Milestones:


	Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 quarter one:&amp;nbsp; Make two datasets related to food security available for public use.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Open data is a priority for the U.S. Government. Sharing our datasets will allow outside organizations and individuals to build on our knowledge and learning and promote transparancy. &amp;nbsp;Nine new data sets are online (Malawi, Mozambique, Nepal, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia, and the Feed the Future Monitoring System (FTFMS) Aggregate Dataset, which is three data sets in one). &amp;nbsp;This is in addition to Bangladesh, Ghana, and the WEAI from before but which could not be counted because they were before the reporting period. &amp;nbsp;We are now ahead of schedule for our FY 2015 quarter one milestone.
	FY 2014 quarter two:&amp;nbsp; Participate in or coordinate 10 formal knowledge-sharing events addressing Feed the Future and cross-sector initiatives.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Feed the Future seeks to advance comprehensive strategies that focus on improving the productivity and market access of small-scale producers, particularly women, and to increase the adoption of transformative technologies. &amp;nbsp;Knowledge-sharing helps achieve these goals both within Feed the Future investments and throughout the wider development community. &amp;nbsp;To date, we have held 25 formal knowledge-sharing events addressing Feed the Future and cross-sector initiatives.
	FY 2014 quarter three:&amp;nbsp; Conduct 15 Bureau for Food Security (BFS) and Feed the Future portfolio reviews.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;​Portfolio&amp;nbsp;reviews promote accountability and performance by allowing USAID to review new priorities, mission programming, financial data, and results. &amp;nbsp;From March to May 2014, USAID conducted portfolio reviews for 24 Missions: &amp;nbsp;Ethiopia, Senegal, Malawi, Mali, South Africa, Bangladesh, Tanzania, Zambia, Nepal, Ghana, West Africa Regional, Cambodia, Guatemala, Rwanda, Mozambique, Uganda, India, Kenya, Haiti, Tajikistan, Nigeria, Liberia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and East Africa Regional. &amp;nbsp;
	FY 2014 quarter four:&amp;nbsp; Participate in 10 BFS senior-level speaking engagements with stakeholders.&amp;nbsp;We exceeded this milestone by participating in 18 speaking engagements during FY 2014 quarter four. &amp;nbsp;In total, we participated in 79 senior-level speaking engagements in FY 2014. The breakdown is as follows: quarter one: 14; quarter two: 17; quarter three: 30; quarter four: 18
	FY 2015 quarter one:&amp;nbsp; Make seven datasets (since FY 2014) related to food security available for public use.&amp;nbsp;USAID met this milestone in FY 2014 quarter one. &amp;nbsp;Nine datasets are online as of September 2014 (Malawi, Mozambique, Nepal, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia, and the Feed the Future Monitoring System (FTFMS) aggregate dataset, which is three combined datasets). &amp;nbsp;This is in addition to Bangladesh, Ghana, and the WEAI, which were published before the reporting period.
	FY 2015 quarter two:&amp;nbsp; Participate in or coordinate 10 formal knowledge-sharing events addressing Feed the Future and cross-sector initiatives.&amp;nbsp;Due to dedicated efforts by the Bureau for Food Security (BFS) team, USAID met its knowledge‐sharing event target for FY 2015 quarter two. In addition to the regular monthly meetings of BFS’ flagship Ag Sector Council Seminar Series, BFS held two special seminars that drew strong audiences from cross‐cutting sectors. Feed the Future values interactive events that allow agricultural development practitioners to network, access new technical information, and build on others' ideas.
	FY 2015 quarter three:&amp;nbsp; Conduct 15 BFS and Feed the Future portfolio reviews.&amp;nbsp;BFS conducted 24 portfolio reviews of Feed the Future country programs with USAID missions &amp;nbsp;from March to May 201, exceeding the milestone target of 15 reviews. &amp;nbsp;Portfolio reviews promote accountability and performance by allowing BFS to review mission programming accomplishments and challenges, financial data, and results. &amp;nbsp;The process of preparing reviews also helps ensure accurate activity data and consistent reporting across FTF, maintaining data quality.&amp;nbsp; This is an effective exercise that BFS continues to streamline with other Agency reporting requirements.
	FY 2015 quarter four: Participate in 10 BFS senior-level speaking engagements with stakeholders.&amp;nbsp;BFS exceeded this milestone by participating in 20 speaking engagements during FY 2015 Q4. &amp;nbsp;In total, BFS participated in 87 senior-level speaking engagements in FY 2015. The breakdown is as follows: Q1: 36; Q2: 15; Q3: 16; Q4: 20. &amp;nbsp;This milestone helps ensure that a broad movement of stakeholders recognizes that food insecurity can be eliminated.

Feed the Future is integral to achieving the Fiscal Year (FY)&amp;nbsp;2014-2015 Agency Priority Goal (APG) for Food Security. USAID’s Bureau for Food Security (BFS) will track performance of investments. BFS coordinates closely with the U.S. Global Health Initiative and USAID’s Office of Food for Peace non-emergency programs to: 1) align investments in focus countries’ “zone of influence” to the extent possible; and 2) maintain a common set of core indicators to track performance. &amp;nbsp;The Administrator will report on behalf of the Agency and Feed the Future, and the BFS Senior Deputy Assistant Administrator will have lead responsibility for accomplishment of this APG. The USAID Office of Strategic Planning and Performance Management and of the Feed the Future Deputy Coordinator for Development will work closely to track milestones and progress toward this APG.

Contributing U.S. Government programs or partners outside the agency:

Representatives from the U.S. Departments of State, Treasury, and Agriculture, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, Peace Corps, and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative approved 19 multiyear strategies, which detail Feed the Future investments and donor coordination for each of the Feed the Future focus countries. This interagency group continues to meet regularly to monitor progress and coordinate program implementation. &amp;nbsp;Our Results Framework also captures the whole-of-government level of effort and impact. Several programs in these respective departments and agencies impact achievements in agricultural productivity and food security. These programs provide data that will feed into our tracking of the 2014-2015 APG through the Feed the Future Monitoring System.&amp;nbsp;

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Increasingly, foreign policy is economic policy.  To maintain American leadership in an era defined by economic power, we need to shift economics from the periphery to the center of U.S. foreign policy, and keep driving an economic agenda that confronts the major economic challenges of our time.  Peace, prosperity, sustainable development, stability, and security are inexorably linked to economic growth and development.  Government alone cannot bring about global growth and development;  it can only do so with the cooperation of the private sector.  Through innovative business models and entrepreneurship, promotion of free markets, human rights, labor rights, rule of law, respect for the environment, and the free exchange of ideas, the Department of State, USAID, and the U.S. private sector directly enhance the ability of our nation to advance security, prosperity, and sustainable economic growth for America and the world.
In a world where 95 percent of consumers live outside the United States, American prosperity depends on strong demand for our goods and services abroad and the free flow of goods and capital.  While the private sector does the trading and investing, the government has an important role in strengthening America’s economic reach.  State Department and USAID officials work to open foreign markets; advocate on behalf of U.S. firms; foster science, technology, education, and innovation; improve governance, rule of law, and transparency; and advance conditions for private sector-led growth.  These actions all promote economic growth and help create jobs in the United States. 
In the developing world, inclusive economic growth, in which all members of society share in the benefits of growth, can be transformative by reducing poverty, expanding opportunity, and reducing gender inequality.  Development assistance is in our economic interest, in our strategic interest, and is a visible expression of our values.  The United States and other countries are helping one billion people out of extreme poverty by 2030 through investments that improve economic opportunity, health, food security, education, stability, and accountable governance.  While we cannot stop shocks from happening, we are committed to doing more to help people build the resilience to withstand them.  Workforce development programs promote inclusion by providing youth with job-specific skills.  Respect for labor rights ensures that workers enjoy a fair share of the benefits of economic growth. 
A more innovative world is a more prosperous world and one that can tackle global challenges more effectively.  To this end, the United States fosters a positive international environment for creative entrepreneurs.  Ours is a knowledge economy, with over 60 percent of American exports in 2010 based on innovation.  U.S. strength and leadership in technology, research and development, and new methods of doing business are strategic assets that attract international support for U.S. economic policies.  The United States champions openness, transparency, non-discrimination, a free and open Internet, broadband access, the protection of intellectual property, and actively assists other countries in these areas.  We also promote cross-border scholarly, entrepreneurial, and scientific exchanges and collaboration, including through public-private partnerships.

</objective_statement><objective_overview>Reducing extreme poverty and its causes has long been a central goal of the U.S. government’s development efforts.  The Administration has prioritized inclusive economic growth and democratic governance as the only sustainable ways to accelerate development and eradicate extreme poverty.  President Obama has called for the United States to “join with our allies to eradicate . . . extreme poverty in the next two decades.”  Recent progress toward this goal is encouraging:  since 2000, faster growth has led to falling aggregate poverty rates throughout the developing world, including sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America.  Developing countries have cut their poverty rates in half in 10 years, with strong support from the United States and the international community.
Inclusive economic growth, in which all members of society benefit, can reduce political turmoil and conflict by stabilizing countries and regions.  When the causes of poverty and hunger are addressed by helping youth gain access to economic opportunities, connecting people to the global economy, building resilience to economic and social stresses in conflict-prone societies, empowering women and minorities, and saving children from disease and preventable death, the United States and the world are stronger and more secure.  As countries develop, they open their markets, become potential consumers of U.S. goods and services, and contribute to regional stability.  To meet the goal of a world without extreme poverty, we continue to pay particular attention to the need for inclusive economic growth in fragile or conflict-affected states, where extreme poverty is likely to be concentrated in the coming decade and where growth can be uneven and volatile.
Through diplomacy and development programs, the Department of State and USAID encourage both governments and increasingly influential non-state actors to:  demand and implement sound macroeconomic policy, good public financial management and accountability, and transparent and effective financial institutions and regulation; invest in public goods (like safe water and infrastructure); and establish an environment that permits the private sector, innovators, entrepreneurs, and civil society to flourish.  We also encourage governments to work with civil society organizations, including labor organizations and business chambers.  These groups have an important role as partners in development, influencing decisions regarding government resource allocation and the development agenda at the country level.
The Department of State and USAID can also play a critical role facilitating private sector engagement and private-public partnerships throughout the world.  The private sector paves the way for reform efforts, creating bonds among people that foster a virtuous cycle of investment, growth, profits, and jobs in which everyone benefits.
We also support gender and minority integration and encourage governments to consider the impact of new policies on both men and women and majority and minority groups.  This is a proven way to ensure that growth is inclusive and that it leads to better outcomes.  We also support accessible quality education to reduce extreme poverty.  An educated populace is healthier, more productive economically, and more active and empowered politically at all levels of society.
To help make countries more resilient in the face of shocks, USAID has developed Policy and Program Guidance to Building Resilience to Recurrent Crisis.  This policy promotes resilience as an analytical, programmatic, and organizing concept to address the causes of chronic vulnerability and recurrent crisis.  Greater resilience can help vulnerable communities emerge from cycles of crisis onto a pathway toward development.
Globally, 842 million people are chronically hungry.  Climate change will make meeting the food and nutrition needs of a growing global population even more challenging.  The resulting malnutrition can translate to a loss of as much as eight percent of a country’s gross domestic product.  To tackle these food and nutrition security challenges, the U.S. government engages on policy, trade, investment, and development tracks – both bilaterally and through multilateral organizations such as the World Food Program.  Through the Feed the Future Initiative, we work to increase agricultural productivity by partnering with governments, donor organizations, the private sector, and civil society.  By focusing on small farmers, particularly women, we promote inclusive growth that increases incomes and reduces hunger, poverty, and under-nutrition.  We also support food security goals through the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition and Partnerships for Growth.
External factors influence whether we attain our development goals.  U.S. government development programs are typically only a small fraction of the economy in countries where we operate, so the political and economic environment inside a country is critical.  Success is more likely when partner governments set a good policy and regulatory foundation for growth and improved public service delivery and encourage a vibrant private sector that invests and creates jobs.  Events such as another global economic slowdown, political instability, conflict, drought, floods, and other natural disasters could all cause setbacks.  In times of government austerity, donor resources can drop, making it more difficult to achieve development goals.
Strategies for Achieving the Objective
The world is coalescing around a goal to end extreme poverty by 2030, with growing optimism that this remarkable goal is within reach.  The U.S. role is critical to ensuring continued global progress. American ingenuity is essential to solving the most complex development challenges that stand in the way of a world without extreme poverty.
The Department and USAID are making critical contributions toward achieving this goal.  Ending extreme poverty requires enabling inclusive growth and promoting free, peaceful, and self-reliant societies that build human capital and create social safety nets for the poorest members of society, including women and other marginalized groups, such as people with disabilities, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) people, and members of indigenous or ethnic minority groups.  Engagement can open doors for development by resolving conflict, fostering political stability, and advocating development-friendly policies.  U.S. government initiatives that increase food security, reduce deaths from preventable illness, and improve energy access address fundamental causes of poverty.  USAID's work on education and resilience in the face of recurrent crisis is reaching millions in extreme poverty, and cross-cutting efforts on gender, governance, and climate are key to sustainability.  USAID is also strongly positioned in the countries - many of them fragile - where extreme poverty affects the most people.
The Department and USAID promote inclusive growth through initiatives such as the African Women's Entrepreneurship Program (AWEP), which provides professional networking, business development, and trade capacity building opportunities for prominent women entrepreneurs across sub-Saharan Africa.  AWEP includes an export readiness program, technical assistance, and access to capital. It empowers small-and-medium-sized African enterprises to capitalize on the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, increasing trade regionally and with the United States.  USAID’s Women’s Leadership Incentive Fund is also used annually to leverage Mission funding in support of women’s economic empowerment and female entrepreneurs are key participants in USAID’s worldwide economic growth projects.  For example, using Leadership Funds, women in Bangladesh will be empowered to lead on employment and labor reform in the apparel sector, a crucial arena for promoting inclusive economic growth.
USAID's Policy Framework features eight interrelated development objectives:  (1) increase food security; (2) promote global health and health systems; (3) reduce the impact of climate change and promote low emissions growth; (4) promote sustainable, broad-based economic growth; (5) expand and sustain the ranks of stable, prosperous, and democratic states; (6) provide humanitarian assistance and support disaster mitigation; (7) prevent and respond to crises, conflict, and instability; and (8) improve lives through learning and education.  Poverty is multi-dimensional, and elements of each of these eight objectives are essential to address the causes and consequences of extreme poverty and promote inclusive growth.
USAID is establishing a new development model that focuses on creating public-private partnerships and harnessing science, technology, and innovation to deliver measurable results.  The new model is grounded in the reality that political leadership and policy reform are essential preconditions to driving investment to the regions and sectors where it has the biggest impact on reducing extreme poverty and ending the most devastating consequences of child hunger and child death.  This approach requires integrated diplomatic and development efforts as we seek policy reform and promote investment and responsible business conduct in complex and transitional environments.
