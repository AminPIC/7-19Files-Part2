In 2016, FEHB plan performance will be assessed based on a common set of measures of clinical quality, customer service and appropriate resource use; this performance assessment will be used in the determination of plan profit margins.&amp;nbsp; While each plan will be assessed based on its performance, overall progress for the FEHB program will be measured by an increase in the number of FEHB plans at or above the 50th percentile of the relevant national, commercial benchmark&amp;nbsp; year-on-year as measured by FEHB plan scored values on the designated high priority indicators used continuously during the evaluation period.&amp;nbsp; These high priority measures include: risk adjusted all cause readmissions, timeliness of prenatal care and blood pressure control.
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>To establish a consistent assessment system that includes objective performance standards, OPM has developed the FEHB Plan Performance Assessment. This assessment incorporates a discrete set of quantifiable measures to examine key aspects of health plan performance and a contract oversight evaluation by the contract officer. The FEHB Plan Performance Assessment will be linked to health plan profit. Quantifiable measures are grouped into three performance areas: Clinical Quality, Customer Services, and Resource Use (collectively termed QCR). The QCR measures consist of Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) and Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) measures. The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) oversees the set of HEDIS and CAHPS measures which is used nationwide to measure performance of health plans in various areas. OPM is using NCQA’s national or regional benchmarks in the FEHB Plan Performance Assessment.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

To focus attention on priority issues, OPM has developed a hierarchy for the QCR measures. In assigning priority levels to measures, OPM considered whether the measure assessed health outcomes, supported specific OPM policy priorities, and was relevant to FEHB subpopulations with particular health needs. Improvement on these high priority measures will indicate improved quality and carrier focus on critical healthcare areas for the FEHB Program.

&amp;nbsp;

This assessment system directly supports Goal 9 of the 2014-2018 OPM Strategic Plan by requiring that FEHB health plans meet rigorous industry standards and higher levels of health plan accountability. These higher standards and increased accountability lead to higher quality health benefits available to&amp;nbsp;federal employees, federal retirees, their families, and newly eligible populations. This new initiative is also closely aligned with the current Administration’s goal of health care system improvement and parallels other federal agency and private payer processes.

</progress_update><themes><theme>General Government</theme></themes><contributing_programs_and_other_factors>The Offices of Planning and Policy Analysis (PPA) and Healthcare and Insurance (HI) collaborate to offer the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) to ensure Federal employees’ needs are met and available benefits align with best practices. Specifically, PPA provides policy guidance and actuarial support by reviewing the cost of contracts under Federal benefits programs, conducts rate negotiations with carriers, and determines the amount the Government contributes towards employees’ benefits. HI oversees federal benefits programs, which includes contracting with insurance carriers as well as operating an annual open season for federal employees and retirees to review and consider changing their current health choices. HI and PPA also work with the OPM Office of Inspector General (OIG) which conducts audits of FEHB carriers. The OIG conducts onsite and desk audits of carriers, issues preliminary audit findings, draft, and final audit reports.

&amp;nbsp;

OPM works with insurance carriers participating in the FEHB Program to negotiate the best rates and value of benefits for federal employees, retirees and their families. OPM also works closely with benefits officers across the Federal Government to provide guidance on the FEHB Program policies and procedures. Benefits officers then communicate this information to employees within their agency to ensure Federal employees are educated on their FEHB benefits.
</contributing_programs_and_other_factors></Agency_Priority_Goal><Strategic_Goals><Strategic_Goal><id>3298</id><strategic_goal_header>SG9 Healthier Americans</strategic_goal_header><strategic_goal_statement>Increase the percentage of states covered by at least one Multi-State insurance carrier and percentage of states covered by two or more Multi-State insurance issuers. Increase the number of carriers receiving OPM “Exemplary” or “Most Improved” distinction for health care quality or customer service.
Improve overall satisfaction with health plan as reported by health plan enrollees in Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS). Decrease the number of ineligible dependents on enrollee’s FEHB coverage.
</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>This goal establishes OPM’s role in improving the health status of populations covered under OPM- sponsored health insurance programs.  Incorporating responsibilities granted through the Affordable Care Act, populations served by OPM-sponsored health insurance programs include employees of tribal organizations and formerly uninsured Americans served by Multi-State Plans as well as Federal employees, Federal retirees, and dependents of Federal employees and retirees.
High quality health insurance promotes access to care, supports better health and better care, empowers enrollee choice, and increases employee loyalty.  Better care prevents long term disability and disease, stabilizes chronic conditions, and minimizes hospitalization.  Effective worksite wellness programs along with health conscious workers and community environments complement insurance benefits and reinforce positive choices.   Additional benefits, such as life, long term care, dental, vision, and flexible spending accounts, improve employee quality of life, meet unique family needs, and increase employee loyalty.
