By the end of FY 2016, build and launch curricula for staffing and classification.&amp;nbsp; Baseline HR professionals’ proficiency levels for the Staffing specialty area competencies, and set targets for improvement.&amp;nbsp; By the end of FY 2017, build and launch curricula for employee relations and labor relations; and design a certification program for existing HR University curricula.
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>The Federal human resources profession performs the vital role of supporting the recruitment, hiring and management of the Federal civilian workforce. The President’s Management Agenda and OPM Strategic Plan both rely critically on the ability of human resources professionals to keep abreast of innovations in talent management, evolving human resources policies, and new skills required for successful execution of Federal talent strategies.&amp;nbsp; Currently, investment in development for Federal HR professionals varies across agencies in approach, content, and quality.&amp;nbsp; To assure a leveling-up of HR professional development and support Government-wide HR reforms, OPM is partnering with the Chief Human Capital Officers Council to build a comprehensive curriculum of HR training and education to be delivered through the HR University (HRU).&amp;nbsp; The CHCO Council is using a Community Framework to develop an agreed approach to identifying required skills, assessing the current workforce competencies to identify gaps, and targeting the development of coursework toward high priority skills.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The HRU Curriculum will address all HR professional roles and technical specialty areas, and will consist of courses offered by OPM’s HR Solutions, as well as courses available from other Federal agencies.&amp;nbsp; The Community Framework also includes a credentialing strategy to be developed by the CHCO Council based on benchmarking of industry best practices.&amp;nbsp; A certification program will be built into the HRU Curriculum to support any future credentialing program.

The highest risk to successful execution of this goal is agencies’ willingness to pay for courses offered by HR University.&amp;nbsp; Recovering the investment costs for the curriculum and HRU operations is critical to OPM’s Human Resources Solutions’ (HRS) sustainable delivery of HRU curricula and developmental resources.&amp;nbsp; To mitigate this risk, HRS is collaborating closely with the CHCO Council HR Skills Gaps Executive Steering Committee to build the curriculum.&amp;nbsp; Through a co-production method, HRS will ensure that courses being offered directly meet agencies’ perceived needs for HR skills development.

By the end of FY 2017, OPM will have pilot tested the HR strategies deliverables from FY 2016.&amp;nbsp; OPM will analyze and assess the results received from these pilot tests to determine if further design/development is needed or if the agency is ready to launch in FY 2018.&amp;nbsp; OPM will complete the development of the staffing HR curriculum as well as other agreed upon action plan objectives that are directly related to the root cause analysis to ensure the agency is addressing and resolving these known root causes.&amp;nbsp; In summary, the goal for FY 2017 is to complete the development of the HR staffing curriculum and begin analyzing the results from participants taking these courses to determine if mastery is achieved. &amp;nbsp;
</next_steps><progress_update>In Q1, OPM developed course titles and content requirements based on internal technical expertise and consultation with the CHCO Council (CHCOC). The development of these course/titles and requirements is consistent with OPM’s university-like approach for the HR curriculum, which includes foundational (community college); specialties (undergraduate); and world class strategy (graduate).

In Q2, OPM worked to identify a vendor with the technical expertise required to build courses based on learning requirements. Meanwhile, OPM partnered with the CHCOC to identify additional resources Federal HR specialists will need to supplement the curriculum. Examples include:


	a competency assessment to identify skills gaps and development needs;
	developmental detail programs that will enable HR specialists to pursue experiential learning to develop competencies; and
	certification of mastery as a micro-credentialing strategy that can develop support for certification as a formal requirement for advancement in the Federal HR profession.


OPM also continued its initiative to validate technical competencies for the classification technical specialty area, as a precursor for eventual development of classification courses. Finally, OPM launched planning for the 2016 HR Virtual Conference, which will focus thematically on staffing in support of the Hiring Excellence Campaign and the HRU curriculum build-out.

In Q3, OPM assembled an integrated program team to redesign the Delegated Examining (DE) Certification Program to include a more robust and comprehensive assessment process. The IPT developed a draft framework and presented it to the CHCOC members on May 24th, 2016, and received concurrence to continue the effort. The framework will include a formal assessment, as well as proof of mastery through demonstrated experience, to ensure HR staffing professionals are knowledgeable and have proven capable to perform delegated examining successfully and in accordance with law and regulation.

Also in Q3, OPM awarded a contract for the development of the HR curriculum. The selected contractor began work on developing the objectives and curriculum recommendations for the staffing component of the curriculum. These recommendations and subsequent HR staffing courses will map to OPM learning requirements as well as those needs articulated by the CHCOC. OPM also began planning for the curriculum rollout to take place in Q4, worked with the CHCOC to formulate a strategy for assessing HR competencies in order to help agencies and HR specialists target their developmental investments and activities, continued validating technical competencies for the classification technical specialty area, and continued planning the HR Virtual Conference.

In Q4 of FY 2016, OPM presented the draft objectives and curriculum recommendations for the staffing specialists and a DE certification prototype to the CHCOC’s Executive Steering Committee for HR Skills Gap for acceptance. OPM also held an HR Virtual Conference to launch HRU staffing courses as part of the President’s Management Agenda Hiring Excellence Initiative.&amp;nbsp; OPM validated technical competencies for classification, which will be used to inform the classification curriculum.

&amp;nbsp;

Also in Q4, the HR Closing Skills Gaps FAST Team and the Workforce Data Analytics Strategy group completed a root cause analysis for the Federal HR Specialist. This data will be used to inform OPM’s planning efforts in FY 2017 and beyond.

As the Suitability Executive Agent, the Director of OPM is responsible for ensuring that those whom agencies select and retain to serve the United States Government and the American people are fit to serve.  To do this, we must develop and implement consistent, uniform policies, tools, and processes for determinations of suitability, assignment to sensitive positions, and access to Federal facilities’ and information systems.  Executing these responsibilities encompasses the collection of background investigation information.  OPM’s activity in support of this goal helps protect our national security and provides the American people a reliable and responsible employee team they can trust in fulfilling important government functions. 
OPM is mandated by statute to ensure delegated human resource authorities are carried out in accordance with merit system principles and OPM standards. In addition, Executive Order 13197 (Government-wide Accountability for Merit System Principles; Workforce Information) authorizes OPM to hold Executive departments and agencies accountable to the President for effective human capital management.
