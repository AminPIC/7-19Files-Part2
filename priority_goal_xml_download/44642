By September 30, 2017, increase approved capacity authorized for renewable (solar, wind, geothermal, and hydropower) energy resources affecting Department of the Interior managed lands, while ensuring full environmental review, to at least 16,600 Megawatts (since the end of FY 2009).
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Problem or opportunity being addressed

As manager of one-fifth of the nation’s landmass and 1.7 billion acres of the outer continental shelf, the Department of the Interior plays a major role in implementing the Obama Administration’s “Smart from the Start” strategy to develop all appropriate sources of renewable and conventional energy on U.S. public lands.&amp;nbsp; Responsible development of conventional and renewable resources on Interior managed lands and waters involve processing applications in a focused manner with full environmental analysis and public review. By advancing renewable energy, Interior helps America produce more energy at home, reducing our dependency on foreign oil while supporting a growing economy, creating jobs, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Onshore, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has identified 20.6 million acres of public land with wind energy potential in 11 western states, 30 million acres with solar energy potential in six southwestern states, and 111 million acres of public land in western states and Alaska with geothermal resource potential.&amp;nbsp; Offshore, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) manages the Outer Continental Shelf, 1.7 billion acres of federal-offshore lands with enormous wind-energy potential.

In addition, Interior reduces energy consumption within its own buildings at over 1,000 Interior sites nationwide ranging from visitor centers to wildlife refuges and tribal facilities, and increasingly self-generates energy by installing rooftop solar panels at Interior owned sites as appropriate.&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives

This goal ties directly to Mission Area 3, “Powering Our Future and Responsible Use of the Nation’s Resources,” of the Department of the Interior’s FY 2014-2018 Strategic Plan.&amp;nbsp; The priority goal helps Interior meet Goal 1, “Secure America’s Energy Resources,” through responsible development of renewable energy on our public lands by facilitating environmentally appropriate solar, wind and wave, geothermal, and hydropower projects in the right ways and right locations. &amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Key barriers and challenges 

Permitting in an environmentally responsible manner sometimes results in changes to applicants’ project proposals.&amp;nbsp; For example, proposed projects may be rejected or reduced in size and scope to avoid or minimize impacts to tribal and cultural resources, threatened and endangered species and their habitat, viewsheds, and other areas designated for protection by Congress, the President, or the Secretary of the Interior.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Additionally, renewable energy companies themselves sometimes scale down, modify timelines, develop projects in phases, or otherwise modify or withdraw projects for reasons unrelated to Interior’s permitting process.&amp;nbsp; By tracking progress on a quarterly basis, Interior monitors emerging issues and challenges associated with renewable energy projects.&amp;nbsp; In recent years, private companies’ applications for renewable energy projects on Interior lands have declined due to difficulties in securing financing and obtaining power purchase agreements with electric utility companies.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, technology and transmission constraints, such as an applicant needing to upgrade a transmission line, impact the number of renewal energy applications and approvals.

&amp;nbsp;

Stakeholder Engagement

BLM developed the goal in conjunction with the Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management as well as other Federal agencies including DOD, USDA, EPA, NOAA; Interior bureaus including BIA, FWS, NPS, USGS; and States, local entities, conservation groups, industry and others engaged in advancing the Administration’s ‘all-of-the-above’ strategy to develop domestic energy resources and to achieve one of the Secretary of the Interior’s top priorities for “Powering Our Future.”&amp;nbsp; Additional information is available via http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/energy/renewable_energy.html. &amp;nbsp;

The ability to approve additional capacity for power generation and/or transmission depends significantly upon the viability of the applicant, and the environmental suitability of the project and site.&amp;nbsp; The Department ensures full environmental and cultural resource review when assessing renewable energy projects for approval.&amp;nbsp; These activities must be adequately resourced by the project proponent to avoid delays in approval and possible withdrawal of proposals.&amp;nbsp; Assistance from the National Park Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service has been an important addition to the success of authorizing renewable energy projects.&amp;nbsp; The Department continues to look at other approaches to facilitate development of potential projects.
</next_steps><progress_update>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) authorized one additional project totaling 100 megawatts (MWs) bringing the cumulative total to 16,062 MW approved since the start of FY 2009.&amp;nbsp; The 60 MW Dixie Meadows Geothermal project was delayed due to scheduling issues, and is now expected to be approved during Q1 of FY 2017.
</progress_update><themes><theme>Energy</theme><theme>Natural Resources and Environment</theme></themes><contributing_programs_and_other_factors>Contributing Programs within the agency

The following bureaus within Interior contribute to this goal:


	Bureau of Land Management (BLM): onshore solar, wind, geothermal, and transmission projects (http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/energy/renewable_energy.html).
	Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM): offshore wind, wave, and transmission projects (http://www.boem.gov/Renewable-Energy/) .
	Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA): onshore renewable energy and transmission projects on Tribal lands (http://www.indianaffairs.gov/WhoWeAre/AS-IA/IEED/DEMD/RO/index.htm).
	Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS): assists other agencies and the energy industry in environmental review to avoid and mitigate the impacts of renewable energy development on wildlife.&amp;nbsp; Through an intensive public process, FWS issued onshore wind energy guidelines with help from the wind energy industry, states, and wildlife conservation groups (http://www.fws.gov/ecological-services/energy-development/energy.html).&amp;nbsp;
	National Park Service (NPS): ensures the safeguarding of viewsheds and issues related to national parks and special status areas near proposed renewable energy sites by participating in the decision mak­ing process for project approval (https://www.nature.nps.gov/geology/energy/index.cfm).&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;

Contributing programs or partners outside the agency

Interior works with a number of agencies coordinating renewable energy work including other Federal, State and local land managers and resource management agencies with responsibilities in the outer continental shelf:


	Department of Energy (DOE): provides training, tech­nical assistance, policy support, transmission planning, siting of large scale projects, research and development of new technologies, and spon­soring research and development of wind turbine impacts on wildlife.
	Department of Defense (DOD): Interior works with DOD on the siting review of onshore and offshore renewable energy projects that may potentially impact the DOD mission and is assisting the DOD in the identification of renewable energy projects on DOD withdrawn lands that could potentially be jointly permitted by Interior and the DOD.
	Department of Agriculture (USDA): coordination for renewable energy development on the significant number of Forest Service acres adjacent to Interior’s lands. &amp;nbsp;
	Tribal governments: Interior, through its Bureau of Indian Affairs, coordinates with tribal governments for any renewable energy or transmission line projects on tribal lands.
