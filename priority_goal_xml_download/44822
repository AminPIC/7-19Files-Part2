By September 30, 2017, the Department of the Interior will facilitate the availability of water supplies employing conservation, efficiency, and technology in the western United States through Bureau of Reclamation water conservation programs to 1,100,000 acre-feet cumulatively since the end of FY2009.
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Problem or opportunity being addressed

The Nation faces an increasing set of water resource challenges: aging water-related infrastructure, rapid population growth, depletion of groundwater resources, and climate variability and change. Shortages and water use conflicts have become more commonplace in many areas of the US, even in &quot;normal&quot; years.&amp;nbsp;Water issues and challenges are especially increasing in the West due&amp;nbsp;to prolonged drought and population shift. &amp;nbsp;A sustainable water supply is critical to address current and future water shortages, degraded water quality, increased demands for water and energy from growing populations, recognition of environmental water requirements, and water inequity for Indian tribes and rural communities disadvantaged by financial need or geographic isolation.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Traditional water management approaches, by themselves, no longer meet today's needs.&amp;nbsp; Federal leadership is critical to widespread acceptance and implementation of effective conservation and recycling techniques.&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives

This goal contributes to Mission Area 5, “Ensuring Healthy Watersheds and Sustainable, Secure Water Supplies,” of the Department of the Interior’s FY 2014-2018 Strategic Plan.&amp;nbsp; This latest version of the Priority Goal builds upon efforts started with the initial FY 2010/2011 Priority Goal to “Enable capability to increase available water supply for agricultural, municipal, industrial, and environmental uses in the western United States up to 350,000 acre-feet (estimated amount) by 2012 through the bureau’s various conservation-related programs, such as water reuse and recycling (Title XVI) and WaterSMART Grants.

&amp;nbsp;

Key barriers and challenges 

Measuring water conservation can be complex. The primary challenges and risks that influence achievement of the Priority Goal include:


	The availability of water measurement data; &amp;nbsp;
	The number and scope of the projects proposed from year-to-year;
	State water laws (e.g., disincentives to water conservation);
	The ability to complete environmental compliance in a reasonable timeframe and cost;
	Local cost-shares (e.g., inability to meet cost-share requirements identified by respective program).


&amp;nbsp;

Stakeholder Engagement

Reclamation works collaboratively with non-federal, state, local and tribal governments, water districts, and other entities on a cost-shared basis to implement water management and conservation projects in the 17 Western states. Reclamation incorporates stakeholder feedback into its conservation efforts by engaging stakeholders during program formulation and significant program revisions.&amp;nbsp; For example, based on applicant feedback, Reclamation revised the Title XVI funding opportunity to make it easier for applicants to request funding for ongoing work without having to break it into project phases. Similarly, Reclamation published the WaterSMART Strategic Implementation Plan in the Federal Register in March 2011 (http://www.usbr.gov/watersmart/docs/FedRegister_WaterSMART_Implementation_plan_FINAL.PDF) and incorporated comments into the final document.&amp;nbsp; Reclamation also routinely works with its partners at the State and local level through public outreach meetings, scoping committees, and through reporting and program oversight.&amp;nbsp;

The grant and contract process will recur similarly in FY 2017, with project announcements releasing later this year. More information can be found at http://www.usbr.gov/watersmart/.
</next_steps><progress_update>The Department of the Interior, through the Bureau of Reclamation, facilitated an additional 167,368 acre-feet of water capacity toward the Priority Goal.&amp;nbsp; Together, projects funded from 2010-2016 have contributed 1,144,822 acre-feet of capacity toward the goal, allowing Reclamation to exceed the FY 2017 target of 1,100,000 acre-feet.

During the year, Congress provided additional funding for water conservation efforts to mitigate for drought conditions, and Reclamation was able to provide additional grants to achieve greater water capacity.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Four milestones were identified for Q4, and all were fully met: Reclamation awarded (1) WaterSMART Grants funding on September 19; (2) Title XVI funding on September 19; (3) CALFED Water Conservation Grants on September 16; and (4) Water Conservation Field Services Program (WCFSP) funding on September 16.

The following programs assist Reclamation in accomplishing its goal to enable capability to increase available water supply for agricultural, municipal, industrial, and environmental uses in the western United States:&amp;nbsp;

WaterSMART Grants (http://www.usbr.gov/WaterSMART)

Reclamation provides competitive WaterSMART Grants that provide up to 50% of the cost of on-the-ground projects to save water, increase energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy in water management, address environmental issues, recover endangered species, andfacilitate transfers to new uses.

Title XVI Program (http://www.usbr.gov/watersmart/title/index.html)

Through the Title XVI Water Reclamation and Reuse Program, authorized by P.L.I02-575 in 1992, Reclamation provides financial and technical assistance to local water agencies for the planning, design, and construction of water recycling and reuse projects, thereby improving efficiency, providing flexibility during water shortages, and diversifying the water supply.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

CALFED Water Conservation Grants (http://www.usbr.gov/watersmart/weeg/index.html)

CALFED is a combined State of California and Federal program focused on the restoration of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta’s fragile ecosystem while improving water supply reliability for urban and agricultural water users.&amp;nbsp; The goal of CALFED is to accelerate the implementation of cost-effective water conservation actions that provide state-wide benefits.&amp;nbsp;

Water Conservation Field Services Program (WCFSP) (http://www.usbr.gov/waterconservation/)

Through the WCFSP, Reclamation makes small-scale cost-shared financial assistance available at the area and regional office levels for several types of activities, including on-the-ground efficiency improvements that lead to quantifiable water savings.&amp;nbsp; Reclamation limits WCFSP awards to no more than $100,000 in Federal funding per project.&amp;nbsp;

Yakima River Basin Water Enhancement Project (YRBWEP) (http://www.usbr.gov/projects/Project.jsp)

The purpose of the YRBWEP is to evaluate and implement structural and nonstructural measures to increase the reliability of the irrigation water supply and enhance streamflows and fish passage in the Yakima River basin.&amp;nbsp;

Upper Colorado River Recovery Implementation Program (UCRRIP) (http://www.usbr.gov/uc/index.html)

This large, multi-year project includes state, and local cost-share funding to improve endangered species recovery and water development

&amp;nbsp;

Contributing programs or partners outside the agency

Reclamation works with federal and non-federal entities including states, tribes, local governments, irrigation and water districts, and other entities with water management and delivery authority.&amp;nbsp; Following are some examples of how other partners are involved in the contributing programs:

Competition for finite water supplies is increasing as a result of population growth, agricultural demands, and water for environmental needs.  An increased emphasis on domestic energy development will place additional pressure on limited water supplies, as significant amounts of water may be required for unconventional and renewable energy development.
Impacts of climate change, as evidenced by increases in temperature, decreases in precipitation and snowpack, extended droughts, and depleted aquifers and stream flow in several Reclamation river basins are reducing water supplies.   Water is vital for the environment and the economies of rural and urban communities in the west.  The Department will “increase” water supplies through BOR’s Priority Goal conservation programs.
