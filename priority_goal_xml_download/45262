By September 30, 2017, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) will complete 100 percent of the inspections for federal and Indian potential high-risk oil and gas production cases annually to better ensure accountability and safety.
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Problem or opportunity being addressed

Oil and gas production on Interior’s managed lands represents a significant part of the nation’s hydrocarbon production.&amp;nbsp; In February 2011, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) listed Interior’s management of Federal oil and gas on GAO’s High-Risk List for deficiencies in its oversight of three broad areas:


	Revenue Collection: (a) whether Interior is collecting a “fair return”; (b) whether Interior is consistently meeting its target for production verification inspections; and (c) whether Interior has sufficient capacity to ensure that it is collecting reliable and consistent data on the production and sale of oil and gas from Federal lands and waters.&amp;nbsp;
	Human Capital: Interior’s ability to adequately address persistent problems in hiring, training, and retaining sufficient staff for oversight and management of oil and gas operations on Federal lands and waters.&amp;nbsp;
	Reorganization: whether Interior has the capacity to undertake the broad reorganization of its offshore oil and gas management and revenue collection functions while still providing reasonable assurance that billions of dollars in revenue are properly assessed and collected as well as managing oil and gas exploration and production on Federal lands and waters. In February 2013, GAO reported Interior’s completion of addressing this deficiency.


Conducting annual inspections of high risk oil and gas cases helps ensure accurate production reporting and correct royalty payments, as part of addressing the recommendations specified in the GAO High Risk Listing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;High risk case identification focuses on the following seven risk factors, four generated by the BLM and three derived from the Office of Natural Resources Revenue’s (ONRR) risk model:&amp;nbsp;


	BLM : (1) production rating; (2) number of missing Oil and Gas Operations Reports (OGOR); (3) non-compliance rating; and (4) date of last production inspection.
	ONRR: (1) OGOR reporting error rating; (2) production variance rating; and (3) audit findings rating.


&amp;nbsp;

Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives

In addition to assisting with addressing the revenue collection deficiency, this priority goal ties directly to Mission Area 3, Powering Our Future and Responsible Use of the Nation’s Resources, in the Department of the Interior’s FY 2014-2018 Strategic Plan.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, inspecting high risk producing cases ensures compliance of oil and gas operations with lease terms, regulations in title 43 CFR 3161.3 (a), and other applicable regulations.&amp;nbsp; Section 101(a) of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982 requires, at a minimum, annual inspections of those federal and Indian lease sites producing, or expected to produce, significant quantities of oil or gas or for which a history of non-compliance exists.

&amp;nbsp;

Key barriers and challenges 

The number of certified inspectors limits the Department’s ability to meet annual high risk cases inspection requirements.&amp;nbsp; Historically, high turnover of certified Interior inspectors resulted from competing private sector companies’ hiring efforts.&amp;nbsp; Recent oil price drops, however, seem to be slowing this trend.

&amp;nbsp;

Stakeholder Engagement

Interior developed this goal in conjunction with the White House/OMB and oil and gas production recommendations in response to GAO and the Office of the Inspector General.

The BLM is scheduling a second cohort of the PET Certification program for FY 2017 to accommodate the new PET staff.&amp;nbsp; Additional certified PET staffing capacity will enable the BLM to cover the requisite share of low priority inspection cases.&amp;nbsp; If not completed, low priority cases quickly become future high risk cases.&amp;nbsp; There is also a need to ensure a credible compliance presence in the field especially during industry busy periods when operators may take more risks.&amp;nbsp;
</next_steps><progress_update>As of Q4 FY 2016, BLM conducted 1,965 high risk inspections, or 100% of the 1,965 high risk cases identified for FY 2016.&amp;nbsp; As the year progressed, the pace of inspections increased and the goal of inspecting 100% of these cases was achieved.

As a part of efforts to address weaknesses identified in Interior’s oil and gas programs identified on GAO’s High Risk list, BLM developed a risk-based strategy for determining the high-risk oil and gas cases that should be inspected in each year.&amp;nbsp; This risk-based strategy is providing managers in the field with the means to better determine where production inspections are most needed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Field offices set inspection targets through scoring the current oil and gas cases, using pre-defined criteria including production volumes, previous violations, amount of time since the last inspection, and missing Oil and Gas Operations Reports (from the Office of Natural Resources Revenue).

The Department achieved the goal for high-risk production inspections in FY 2014, FY 2015, and achieved the goal again for FY 2016.&amp;nbsp; The high risk approach better ensures the highest priority inspections are conducted annually.&amp;nbsp; In FY 2016, the BLM added a 60 day close out plan &amp;nbsp;to ensure offices provide 100% coverage for high risk cases and identify additional resources needed early enough to provide assistance to offices that appeared to be unable to meet their targets. &amp;nbsp;
