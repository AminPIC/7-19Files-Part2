</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Overview of the Life Extension Programs part of the goal:

Following the Department of Energy Strategic Plan for 2014-2018, the DOE/NNSA Enterprise Strategic Vision (August 2015) provides the framework for integrating our missions and a future direction in pursuit of DOE’s strategic goals. The highest priority for the Nuclear Weapons Stockpile mission pillar is the sustainment and life extension of reduced weapons currently in the stockpile, which demands a careful and balanced execution of maintaining a safe, secure, reliable, credible and responsive nuclear weapons stockpile, without underground nuclear explosive testing. DOE/NNSA has successfully sustained the deterrent since the unilateral moratorium on nuclear explosive testing in 1992, and will continue to do so through the Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program. This has been accomplished through the capabilities, vision, and determination of DOE/NNSA’s world-class scientists, technicians, and engineers, as well as significant investments in scientific tools, facilities, and people. Sustaining the nuclear weapons stockpile includes a range of priority activities that are interdependent. As weapons systems age, life extension, alteration, and modification programs are addressing aging and performance issues, enhancing safety features, and improving security. DOE/NNSA will meet strategic deterrence requirements with a reduced stockpile size while retaining reliability. To meet national policy for a safe, secure, and effective stockpile as long as nuclear weapons exist, sustainment is necessary to maintain the operational capability. The “3+2” Strategy is the program of record that guides DOE/NNSA’s sustainment efforts, which will eventually downsize the stockpile through the sustainment process.&amp;nbsp; Consistent with the Nuclear Posture Review (DoD 2010) objectives, ongoing sustainment efforts include the production of the W76-1 LEP which will enable reduction of W76 warheads by a factor of two, and the B61-12 LEP which will consolidate four families of the B61 into one and improve both the safety and security of the oldest weapon system in the U.S. arsenal.

Key Barriers and Challenges:


	The NNSA is committed to the national security requirement to meet the immediate needs of the stockpile while maintaining the basic research and development, technology, and production infrastructure to respond to technical, and geopolitical surprise. The NNSA underpins both confidence in the stockpile, and reinforcement of the DoD, and other national security interests.
	To fulfill NNSA's commitment to DoD and to the nation, the NNSA works together with its DoD partner to identify priorities and make the appropriate adjustments to scope, and schedule that will achieve the goals of the President and the NPR.
	NNSA must conduct surveillance, and annual assessments as the nuclear weapons stockpile ages. If technical surprises were to occur, the nation must have safe, and secure facilities, and the science and engineering base to respond. Infrastructure modernization delays continue to challenge NNSA's ability to maintain nuclear surveillance and assessment capability.
	NNSA must continue to meet facility safety and security requirements and work to achieve efficiencies where possible.
	The nation must maintain an unequaled capability to understand the design and physics of any nuclear device. This understanding extends beyond the stewardship of our own stockpile, and includes an ability to analyze and effectively respond to any nuclear threat.


Overview of the Radiological Threats part of the goal:

The NNSA's strategy incorporates a threat-based, defense in depth approach to illicit trafficking that recognizes:


	Smuggling of nuclear and other radioactive materials is an ongoing global enterprise
	Even a single, viable trafficking network constitutes a serious U.S. national security risk and global threat
	There are existing gaps in the global nuclear and radiation detection architecture
	International coordination is imperative to meeting global nuclear security needs

Progress Update for the Radiological Threats part of the goal:

Complete delivery and installation of a cumulative total of 755 fixed, mobile, and man-portable radiation detection systems by theend of FY 2017

DOE/NNSA Global Material Security’s (GMS) Nuclear Smuggling Detection and Deterrence (NSDD) program made progress toward installation and deployment of radiation detection systems at border checkpoints, airports and seaports, internal locations and other controlled land and maritime borders. Exceeded FY16 cumulative target of 716 fixed and mobile detection systems deployed by 7.

The GMS/NSDD program installed fixed radiation detection systems at 21 sites and deployed 13 mobile detection systems for a total of 52 radiation detection systems deployed in FY16, for a cumulative total of 723 systems deployed (606 fixed site and 117 mobile).

The mission of NSDD (formerly Second Line of Defense) is to strengthen the capabilities and commitment of partner countries to deter, detect, and interdict illicit trafficking of nuclear and other radioactive materials within the interiors of partner countries, across international borders, and through the global maritime shipping system.

NSDD provides partner countries with the tools and training necessary to counter nuclear smuggling, thus making an essential contribution to the global nuclear detection architecture. It does this by installing radiation detection systems at high-priority locations around the world and by building a community of states that possess an indigenous capacity to deter, detect, and interdict nuclear and radioactive materials.

</objective_statement><objective_overview>In order to reassure allies and deter potential adversaries as long as nuclear weapons exist, the U.S. must sustain a safe, secure, and effective nuclear arsenal. NNSA will continue to work closely with the Department of Defense (DoD), through the Joint DoD/DOE Nuclear Weapons Council (NWC), to modernize the stockpile through timely execution of approved life extension programs, as outlined in the Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan (SSMP). The SSMP, which is updated annually, details the 25-year program of record for activities supporting the nuclear weapons stockpile. The SSMP, as well as the NWC, is informed by NNSA technical scoping studies, cost and risk analysis, and resource allocation modeling of alternatives.
As the nation’s nuclear weapons age and exceed their stockpile design life, the NNSA must extend their lifespan. The 2010 NPR report, an extensive review of the nation’s nuclear posture, recommended that study options for weapon life extension programs (LEP) consider three approaches: refurbishment of existing warheads, reuse of nuclear components from different warheads, and replacement of nuclear components. The NPR report recommended fully funding the ongoing LEP for the W76 submarine-based warhead, the LEP study and follow-on activities for the B61 bomb, and to initiate a study of LEP options for the W78 intercontinental ballistic missile warhead, including the possibility of reusing the warhead on submarine-launched ballistic missiles to reduce the number of warhead types.
Without recourse to nuclear testing, NNSA will deliver the scientific capability to assess weapon performance as well as the component and manufacturing technologies and supporting infrastructure required to execute the SSMP. NNSA will ensure the safe and secure transportation of nuclear materials and weapons components. At the same time, NNSA will advance the President’s vision for reductions in nuclear weapons by dismantling retired weapons.
