</next_steps><progress_update>Strategy #1: By the end of FY 2017, the percentage of assessed DOE laboratory facilities categorized as “adequate” will increase by 2 percentage points from the FY 2015 baseline.

DOE is on track to categorize 47% of active real property assets as adequate by the end of FY 2017.&amp;nbsp; The DOE Infrastructure Executive Committee has been meeting regularly and is focused on improving DOE’s general purpose infrastructure. DOE programs are working to ensure appropriate investments in active assets required for mission adequacy and functionality and the reduction in the backlog of deficiencies.&amp;nbsp; DOE programs are also working to retire to the inactive status or declare excess those assets that are beyond their lifecycle or do not support mission adequacy and functionality.

Q2 Milestones &amp;amp; Updates:

Issue guidance for preparation of Annual Lab Plans and Campus Strategies.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;


	Status:&amp;nbsp; Completed.&amp;nbsp; The Office of the Under Secretary for Science and Energy (S4) issued the Annual Lab Plans/Campus Strategy Guidance for its laboratories (Science, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Fossil Energy and Nuclear Energy) in February 2016.


NNSA is revising its annual infrastructure planning process to adopt best practices from the SC approach and will identify an NNSA National Laboratory to pilot the new process.&amp;nbsp;


	Status:&amp;nbsp; Completed. NNSA has outlined a path to implement its Master Asset Plan (MAP) a new, NNSA-wide, risk-informed, long-term infrastructure strategic planning process, including MAP Deep Dives at all NNSA sites.&amp;nbsp; NNSA completed its pilot MAP Deep Dive at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in February 2016.


The strategic laboratory infrastructure plan for EM laboratory will be issued.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Attaining mission success requires a sustained commitment to performance-based management and expectations of excellence from DOE headquarters to every site office, service center, laboratory, and production facility. At the center of this goal is a highly qualified, capable, and flexible federal workforce that can execute the mission in a safe, secure, efficient, and sustainable manner. DOE cultivates a performance-based system that links work to meeting agency and Administration goals and achieves results. Management of research and development involves prioritization of those activities with the greatest potential and likelihood for impact. Research decisions are informed by rigorous peer reviews at the portfolio level and solicitation levels. Also, improving contract and project management across the DOE enterprise is a top priority, along with vigilant protection of our cyber networks. Additional project cost and schedule analysis training will be provided, and upgrades will be sought for the information technology infrastructure.
