</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Aviation fatality rates are at historic lows and continue to drop over time.&amp;nbsp; However, FAA recognizes the need to continue addressing precursors to accidents in order to continue to improve the current level of safety in the national airspace.

In the past, the FAA focused on actual incidents and accidents to identify risk within the aviation system.&amp;nbsp; The number of accidents has now dropped to a level in which this is a more difficult activity. &amp;nbsp;The FAA has now developed a proactive approach to identify and address risk.&amp;nbsp; This is done through dramatically increased air traffic data collection, improved analysis, and the implementation of safety mitigations put in place before an accident occurs.

We are continuously trying to work with our agency and industry partners to reduce the number of general aviation fatalities.


	Twenty-nine Safety Enhancements (SEs) have been or are currently being implemented, which address fatal accidents resulting from loss of control-inflight (LOC).&amp;nbsp; (Ongoing)
	Ten SEs related to system component failures were approved by the GAJSC, and are being implemented.&amp;nbsp; (Ongoing)
	Support of the GAJSC, International Helicopter Safety Team (IHST), and US Helicopter Safety Team (USHST) focusing on airman certification and operating standards.&amp;nbsp; Make revisions to training and operations guidance/policy as necessary based on data analysis conducted by the GAJSC, IHST, and approved Safety Enhancements (SEs). (Ongoing)
	Develop and implement a broad outreach campaign to reduce GA accidents by reducing runway incursions. (September 30, 2016)
	Develop mitigating initiatives to reduce pilot deviations, including Runway Incursions, caused by a lack of English language proficiency. (Ongoing)
	Focus on FAA Safety Team (FAASTeam) program products and product delivery systems.&amp;nbsp; Design and develop a system to “push” a continuous stream of aeronautical knowledge to airmen in a way that suits their lifestyle. &amp;nbsp;National FAASTeam Outreach Initiatives include safety articles in the FAA Safety Briefing magazine, FAAST Blast emails, aviation safety courses through the FAASafety.gov website, runway safety educational posters, live safety seminars on weather, ADS-B, UAS, Loss of Control and aeronautical decision making. (Ongoing)
	Aviation Training Device (ATD) Final Rule was completed April 12, 2016 and became effective May 12, 2016.&amp;nbsp; This rule allows increased use of ATDs when obtaining instrument ratings and when receiving training under certain Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14&amp;nbsp;CFR) part 141 appendices.&amp;nbsp; The rule allows more training scenarios to be conducted that are not possible in actual aircraft training.&amp;nbsp; Abnormal and emergency procedures training along with real-world decision-making skills are the focus.&amp;nbsp; This directly supports decreasing the GA fatal accident rate.&amp;nbsp;
	Develop Aviation Safety Information Analysis and Sharing (ASIAS) capabilities that build upon and extend existing capabilities for managing and processing aviation performance data and deploy visualization capabilities that aid causal/contributing factor analyses and risk assessment.


Commercial Air Carrier Fatality Rate


	The FAA is working with aviation industry stakeholders to establish safety management systems within their operations.&amp;nbsp; With these systems in place, the FAA and the aviation industry will work together to address risks.&amp;nbsp;
	Our commercial safety record indicates the Agency has successfully addressed the majority of known system hazards contributing to accidents or incidents. &amp;nbsp;The FAA continues to work with aviation industry stakeholders to establish and implement safety management systems to address and reduce risk within their operations and the National Airspace System (NAS).&amp;nbsp; With these systems in place, the FAA and the aviation industry will work together to address risks. The Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST) has developed multiple safety enhancements and continues to achieve positive results.
	Our success in commercial aviation safety is due in part to the aviation industry and government voluntarily investing in safety enhancements that reduce the fatality risk in commercial air travel in the United States. &amp;nbsp;The work of CAST, along with new aircraft, regulations, and other activities, continues to have a positive impact in reducing&amp;nbsp;the fatality rate for commercial aviation in the United States. &amp;nbsp;CAST has developed 96 safety enhancements to date. &amp;nbsp;The last 19 enhancements were based on non-accident data, demonstrating its progress from reactive safety enhancements to proactive risk mitigation. &amp;nbsp;CAST has developed an integrated, data-driven strategy to reduce the commercial aviation fatality risk in the United States.


Runway Incursions (Category A and B) Rate


	Runway Safety Focus Airports Program: Use risk indicators of actual measured events, e.g. runway incursions and excursions, and evaluation of potential or latent risk indicators (airport design, management and operational changes) to assess and improve policy, guidance, engagement and training strategies to address risk at Focus Airports.&amp;nbsp; The FY16 list was delivered to the Runway Safety Group in December 2015.&amp;nbsp; The information is being used to prioritize the mitigation efforts of the Local and Regional Runway Safety Action Teams. This effort is ongoing.
	Closed Runway Operation Prevention Device: Use speech recognition technology to detect spoken clearances by air traffic controllers to closed runways.&amp;nbsp; (Ex.&amp;nbsp; “Cleared to Land Runway 10L” would create an alarm anytime that runway (10L) is closed and the phrase is monitored by the system). &amp;nbsp;A 30-day period of operational testing by JFK ATC began on August 23. MITRE is currently examining the data.
	Local Runway Safety Action Team (LRSAT) Meeting:&amp;nbsp; Track completion of mandatory Local Runway Safety Action Team Meetings and subsequent development of their Local Runway Safety Action Plan through the team meetings.&amp;nbsp; This effort is ongoing.
	Airport Construction Advisory Council:&amp;nbsp; Address surface safety issues associated with disruptions in air traffic operations caused by runway and taxiway construction. Using Safety Risk Management (SRM) processes, the council identifies weaknesses in the control measures undertaken by the FAA during periods of prolonged construction and develops mitigations to proactively address hazards. This effort is ongoing.
	In August 2016, FAA released a detailed project timeline for the automation of construction notice diagrams.&amp;nbsp; This effort is ongoing.



	Runway Safety Outreach and Education:&amp;nbsp; The National Runway Safety Plan provides the structure/outline for outreach/education to all FAA facilities, Federal Contract Towers, and industry stakeholders.&amp;nbsp; The FAA is leveraging existing platforms, safety organizations, and partnerships with industry groups, unions, local safety reps, and field managers as the primary path and channel for engagement and education.&amp;nbsp; This effort is ongoing.&amp;nbsp;



Hazard Risk Mitigations


	Continue tracking the implementation of mitigations/interventions identified for all ATO Top 5 Hazards’ Corrective Action Plans (CAPs).&amp;nbsp;
	Hold CAP development panels to address the Top 5 Hazards for the next fiscal year.
	Develop and facilitate approval of the CAPs.&amp;nbsp;
	Track the implementation of mitigations/interventions identified for all ATO Top 5 Hazards’ CAPs. Follow-up with stakeholders to ensure that 80% of all identified activities are implemented. Due September 30, 2017

</next_steps><progress_update>General Aviation Fatal Accident Rate
As of September 30, 2016, the rate was 0.91 versus a not-to-exceed (NTE) rate of 1.02 per 100,000 flight hours. &amp;nbsp;This equates to 219 fatal accidents versus a NTE target of 244 for the year. &amp;nbsp;These fatal accidents resulted in 413 fatalities through September 2016. &amp;nbsp;The General Aviation (GA) fatal NTE target is based on an estimated number of flight hours.

To reduce accidents, the General Aviation Joint Steering Committee (GAJSC) has established training topics for airmen based on GAJSC analysis of aircraft accidents. &amp;nbsp;Educational outreach is focused on one of these training topics each month. &amp;nbsp;During the third quarter of FY16, the FAA Safety Team (FAASTeam) and the FAA Office of Communications (AOC) completed educational outreach on the assigned topics via email, social media, and live seminars across the nation.

The three topics were Aircraft Performance and Limitations; Spatial Disorientation; and Engine Maintenance and Performance Monitoring.&amp;nbsp;

In FY 2015, the GAJSC focused on system component failures and powerplant (engine-related) accidents. &amp;nbsp;Ten new safety interventions were developed to mitigate the risks discovered in this study. &amp;nbsp;These and 29 loss-of-control interventions are being implemented, with some having already been completed. &amp;nbsp;The FAA Deputy Administrator met with leaders from the general aviation community to support the work of the GAJSC and to continue the focus on reducing inflight loss-of-control accidents. &amp;nbsp;This meeting was used to increase the awareness of accident causes and work with industry to carry the safety message during the summer flying season.

Commercial Air Carrier Fatality Rate
As of September 30, 2016, there was one fatal accident for the year. &amp;nbsp;Therefore, the actual rate is 0.6 versus a NTE of 6.7 fatalities per 100,000,000 (100 million) persons on board. &amp;nbsp;This equates to five fatalities against a NTE of 58 for the year. &amp;nbsp;

A new rule took effect in May of 2016 regarding Qualification, Service and Use of Crewmembers and Aircraft Dispatchers (part 121). &amp;nbsp;Another rule took effect in March of 2016 on Flight Simulation Training Device Qualification Standards for Extended Envelope and Adverse Weather Event Training Tasks (Part 60). The Part 60 rule was revised to require flight simulator modifications to support stall and upset training. &amp;nbsp;The part 60 rule supports the 2013 issued rule on Qualification and Training of Crewmembers and Aircraft Dispatchers. &amp;nbsp;It gives airlines and training centers three years to have their simulators evaluated and modified before compliance with the training rule when it goes into effect in 2019.

Runway Incursions (Category A and B) Rate

The Runway Incursion rate for fiscal year 2016 fourth quarter is 0.360 per million operations, compared to our annual target rate of 0.395 per million operations. &amp;nbsp;There have been a total of eighteen (18) Category A or B Runway Incursions in fiscal year 2016. This data is still preliminary and not the official end of fiscal year rate as there are several events still to be reviewed and categorized.

Hazard Risk Mitigations
On September 2, 2016 the FAA announced the FY2017 ATO Top 5 issues contributing to risk in the national airspace system. &amp;nbsp;The FY17 Top 5 are:


	Instrument Flight Rules / Visual Flight Rules (IFR/VFR): Close encounters between IFR and VFR aircraft
	Issuance/Cancelation of Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs): Lack of, untimely, or outdated NOTAMs in the system
	NOTAM Prioritization: ATC or pilot unable to distinguish applicable or pertinent NOTAMs
	Runway Flyovers: Unexpected aircraft/vehicle on the runway with another aircraft cleared to takeoff/land
	Wrong Surface Landings: Aircraft lands on wrong runway, on taxiway, or at wrong airport.


&amp;nbsp;
As of September 30, 2016 &amp;nbsp;the FAA completed 88 percent (23 of 26) of Corrective Action Plan (CAP) activities developed to address the ATO’s Top 5 safety issues identified for the Fiscal Year 2016.&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

</objective_statement><objective_overview>Based on current economic and demographic forecasts, it is likely that the movement of people and goods within the U.S. and abroad will continue to increase and the transportation sector will continue to enable economic growth and job creation.  The transportation sector contributed approximately $1.466 trillion, or 9.7 percent, to GDP in 2011.  Our Nation must make strategic investments that enable the movement of people and goods more efficiently with full utilization of the existing capacity across all transportation modes. The cornerstones of this strategy are investments in high-performance passenger rail, the development of a national freight strategy, investments in public transportation, mitigating traffic congestion on our highways, and implementing NextGen to improve operations and alleviate airport congestion.

</objective_statement><objective_overview>In 2011, 34,414 people died and more than 2.2 million people were injured in transportation-related crashes and accidents, according to U.S. DOT national Transportation Statistics.  Motor vehicle crashes caused 32,367 fatalities, or 94 percent of the total, even though the rate of fatalities per hundred million miles of travel was the lowest ever recorded in the United States.  Distracted driving was a contributing factor in at least 3,331 fatal crashes.  Another 1, 213 people died in rail, air, and transit accidents.  We will use our safety programs and regulations for automobiles, airplanes, railroads, trucks, motorcoaches, pipelines, and hazardous materials as effectively as possible to reduce crashes, fatalities, and injuries, and will expand safety oversight to public transit.  We will continue to direct federal resources to address the most serious safety risks and implement program reforms that will advance our safety mission. Between 2001 and 2010, an average of 13 people in the United States died every year in incidents related to the transportation of hazardous material—a rate of one death for every 21 billion ton-miles of hazardous material moved.  In addition to causing deaths and injuries, hazardous material transportation incidents disrupt communities when people are evacuated from their homes, business activity is curtailed, and transportation services are interrupted.  We will continue to develop and encourage the use of safety tools - such as improved data collection, risk management practices, and incident response planning - to prevent, mitigate, and respond to hazardous material transportation accidents.
