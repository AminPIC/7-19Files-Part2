</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>This goal represents HUD’s effort to reduce homelessness among Veterans. Veterans are overrepresented in the homeless population; while only 9.3 percent of the U.S. adult population has Veteran status, Veterans represented approximately 11.3 percent of homeless adults at a given point in time in 2014.&amp;nbsp; On a single night in January 2014, there were 49,933 Veterans reported as experiencing homelessness. Veterans experiencing homelessness often face the same issues that lead others into homelessness, including a lack of affordable housing and inadequate income and savings.&amp;nbsp; Service men and women returning from active duty may also have specific challenges, such as lingering effects of post-traumatic stress disorder and substance abuse, which can make it more difficult for them to find and maintain adequate employment and, consequently, to pay for housing.

Effectively transitioning Veterans experiencing homelessness to permanent housing requires access to healthcare, employment, and benefits.&amp;nbsp; Because Veterans have greater medical and mental health needs than non-Veterans, healthcare and its associated benefits play a significant role in achieving and maintaining stability in permanent housing for Veterans experiencing homelessness.&amp;nbsp; Employment and VA benefits are critical in providing Veterans the income required to support housing and other daily living expenses.

HUD and VA continue to implement proven systems of service delivery to end Veteran homelessness, especially among those experiencing chronic homelessness, such as the Housing First approach.&amp;nbsp; Housing First offers individuals and families experiencing homelessness immediate access to permanent affordable or supportive housing. Reducing clinical and economic barriers, Housing First yields higher housing retention rates, lower returns to homelessness, and significant reductions in the use of crisis service and institutions.

This includes maximum utilization and timely deployments of all HUD-VASH awards, which combines HCV rental assistance to Veterans with case management and clinical services provided by VA. HUD-VASH is one form of permanent housing that HUD and VA are directing to Veterans, along with SSVF program and VA residential treatment programs as a conduit to permanent housing. Through the end of FY 2015, these programs have helped 64,902 Veterans secure permanent housing, greatly surpassing the annual target of 49,000 Veterans served.

In the agency’s work toward the goal of ending homelessness among Veterans, HUD achieved the following notable milestones in FY 2015:


	Tribal HUD-VASH: In December 2014, Congress passed the FY 2015 Omnibus Appropriations bill, which for the first time set aside a portion of HUD-VASH funds for a pilot designed to provide housing and supportive services to Veterans who are homeless or at risk of homelessness living on tribal reservations. HUD and VA designated $4 million for this new effort and worked with Department of Indian Health Services as well as national and regional Native American leaders, associations, and communities to design the program. Awards are expected by December 2015.


&amp;nbsp;


	FY 2014 CoC Program Competition: On January 26, 2015 HUD awarded $1.8 billion in grants to help nearly 8,400 local homeless housing and service programs across the US. The 2014 competition continues HUD’s efforts to target resources, including permanent housing for Veterans, especially those not served by HUD-VASH. These grants went into operation throughout CY 2015 and serve as a crucial resource for the funding of evidence-based interventions to end homelessness.


&amp;nbsp;


	FY 2015 HUD-VASH Awards: On April 20, 2015, HUD and VA awarded nearly $65&amp;nbsp;million to help more than 9,300 homeless Veterans find a permanent place to call home. This allocation brought the total number of HUD-VASH vouchers up to 79,122. By the end of FY 2015, 69,038 of those vouchers were in use by Veterans residing in or in the process of obtaining permanent supportive housing.


&amp;nbsp;


	2015 Local Victories: On January 7, 2015, Mayor Mitch Landrieu announced that the City of New Orleans had eliminated homelessness among Veterans. The city worked to connect 227 Veterans with permanent housing and created a local&amp;nbsp;homeless crisis response system&amp;nbsp;that identifies Veterans experiencing or at risk of homelessness and quickly connects them to the permanent housing solution they need and have earned. On June 1, 2015, Secretary Castro, VA Secretary McDonald and Labor Secretary Perez joined Mayor Annise Parker to announce that the City of Houston effectively ended homelessness among their Veterans. These leaders joined homeless assistance providers, clinical workers, and supporters from across the community at a rally celebrating the creation of Houston’s system that ensures that every Veteran who needs assistance will be quickly linked to the supportive services and permanent housing.


&amp;nbsp;


	Mayor’s Challenge: Announced in 2014 by First Lady Michelle Obama and amplified by leaders across HUD, VA, USICH, and by the National League of Cities, the Mayor’s Challenge is a call to action for mayors to make a commitment to ending Veteran homelessness in their cities by the close of &amp;nbsp;2015. At time of publication, 850 mayors, governors, and county executives have joined the challenge, including mayors from every one of the 25&amp;nbsp;USICH priority communities

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Stable housing, made possible with HUD support, provides an ideal platform for delivering a wide variety of health and social services. Through interagency partnerships at the federal, state, and local levels, HUD will use housing as a platform for coordinating access to a wide variety of services to lower healthcare costs, end homelessness, and support community living. In addition to the moral imperative to end human suffering caused by homelessness, there are compelling economic reasons for investing in efforts to eradicate this complex social problem. To achieve this goal, HUD will continue to partner with local, state, and federal organizations, including the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH), to deploy evidence-based interventions, such as supportive housing, housing first, and rapid rehousing, to more effectively and efficiently use the nation’s limited resources to bring an end to homelessness.

</objective_statement><objective_overview>HUD’s annual “Point-in-Time” estimates measure the scope of homelessness on a single night in January of each year. Based on data reported by more than 3,000 cities and counties, the January 2013 one-night estimate reveals a 24-percent drop in homelessness among veterans and a 16-percent reduction among individuals experiencing long-term or chronic homelessness since 2010. HUD’s estimate also found the largest decline in the number of persons in families experiencing homelessness since the Department began measuring homelessness in a standard manner in 2005. Overall, a total of 610,042 people experienced homelessness in the United States on a single night in January 2013.
Homelessness among unaccompanied youth is a hidden problem, which HUD and its partners are taking steps to solve. Some subpopulations of youth are at particularly high risk for homelessness, including youth aging out of foster care and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning youth.
In 2010, the Obama Administration released Opening Doors*, the first ever comprehensive federal strategic plan to prevent and end homelessness. The goals of the plan are to prevent and end veterans’ and chronic homelessness by 2015, to prevent and end homelessness for families, youth, and children by 2020, and to set a path to ending all types of homelessness. HUD remains committed to the goals of Opening Doors, but to reach them the pace of current efforts must accelerate. Over the next 5 years, HUD will work with its partners to deploy the solutions that we know are effective for the right persons, such as rapid rehousing and permanent supportive housing. These tools must be informed by a Housing First approach, whereby preconditions and barriers to housing entry are removed and people move into housing as quickly as possible.
