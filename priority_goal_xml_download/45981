</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Background:

Reducing roadway fatalities continues to be a top priority at the Department of Transportation (DOT).&amp;nbsp; Roadway crashes are among the leading causes of death in the United States, especially among young people.&amp;nbsp;In 2015, an estimated 35,200 people died on the Nation’s roadways&amp;nbsp;and action must be taken to address this serious public health and safety problem.&amp;nbsp; The financial impact of roadway crashes also puts a significant burden on the Nation: approximately $871 billion per year in economic and societal losses underscores the magnitude of the problem.&amp;nbsp; Roadway crashes are one of the leading causes of traumatic brain injuries as well as permanent spinal cord injuries, putting a heavy burden on our medical systems.

The importance of improving transportation safety is reflected in DOT’s Strategic Plan. The Department strives to make the U.S. transportation system the safest in the world. DOT will work with all of its stakeholders — transportation agencies, elected officials, law enforcement, industry, safety advocates, novice drivers, the disability and older adult communities, and the public — to reduce transportation-related fatalities and injuries and make our roadway system safe for all users.

Progress toward a national roadway safety goal requires collaboration with a diverse group of stakeholders and partners across a range of disciplines.&amp;nbsp; Within DOT, the relevant operating administrations can leverage the respective resources and expertise to more effectively achieve a safer transportation environment. These organizations include the following:


	Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) provides Federal State and local partners the tools, resources, and information necessary to make sound safety investment decisions and coordinates with States to develop Strategic Highway Safety Plans (SHSP) and implement programs that improve the safety of roadway infrastructure on all public roads.
	Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) promotes safe commercial motor vehicle (CMV) (large truck and bus) operations through education, innovation, regulation, enforcement, financial assistance, partnerships, and full accountability to reduce crashes, injuries, and fatalities on our Nation’s roadways involving CMVs.
	National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) develops vehicle safety standards, conducts&amp;nbsp;research on new vehicle safety and technology, and oversees compliance, defect investigations and recalls. &amp;nbsp;NHTSA equally focuses on driver behavior by developing effective traffic safety programs, providing grant funds to States to implement these programs, and implementing national high visibility enforcement campaigns.

</next_steps><progress_update>There were 35,092 motor vehicle traffic fatalities in the United States in 2015, a 7.2 percent increase from the 32,744 fatalities in 2014. An estimated 2.44 million people were injured in motor vehicle traffic crashes, an increase of 4.5 percent from 2014. &amp;nbsp;Overall, 2015 vehicle miles traveled (VMT) also increased by 3.5 percent from 2014 to 3,131 billion, the largest increase since 1992. &amp;nbsp;There were increases in fatalities across most categories.&amp;nbsp; Human choices were also a factor in the increase of fatalities.&amp;nbsp; For example, fatalities in distraction-affected crashes increased 8.8 percent. The number of fatalities in crashes involving an alcohol-impaired driver increased 3.2 percent.&amp;nbsp; Fatalities in speeding-related crashes increased 3 percent.&amp;nbsp; Unrestrained passenger vehicle occupant fatalities (those who were unbelted) increased by 4.9 percent to 9,874. &amp;nbsp;Passenger vehicles include passenger car, SUVs and light trucks.

Increases were seen across most modes of travel.&amp;nbsp; The number of passenger vehicle occupant fatalities increased by 6.6-percent from 2014, which accounted for 59 percent of the overall increase. The 2015 passenger vehicle fatality count (22,441) is the highest number since 2009. &amp;nbsp;

Motorcyclist fatalities increased 8.3-percent to 4,976. &amp;nbsp;In States without universal helmet laws, 58 percent of motor­cyclists killed in 2015 were not wearing helmets, as compared to 8 percent in States with universal helmet laws.

Pedestrian fatalities increased 9.5-percent from 2014. &amp;nbsp;The 2015 pedestrian fatality count (5,376) is the highest number since 1996. Pedalcyclist fatalities increased 12.2-percent from 2014. The 2015 pedalcyclist fatality count (818) is the highest number since 1995.

There were 295 bus crash-related fatalities in 2015, an increase from the 281 fatalities in 2014.

Finally, there were 4,067 fatalities in crashes involving large trucks, 4.1 percent more fatalities than in 2014, the highest since 2008. Of the 4,067 fatalities, 667 (16.4%) were occupants of large trucks, 10.1 percent were nonoccupants, and 73.5 per­cent were occupants of other vehicles.&amp;nbsp;

Stakeholders:

FHWA, FMCSA, and NHTSA have formed strategic alliances with partners from a wide array of backgrounds to enhance and forward the Nation’s roadway safety agenda through guidance, technical assistance, and development of resource materials. Many stakeholders currently address transportation safety issues independently, through individual goals, plans, and activities. Some have implemented substantial safety initiatives, and these contributions are vital to maintaining and improving roadway safety. Involvement by multiple stakeholders provides opportunities for broader public outreach and for the development and implementation of cross-cutting roadway safety strategies reflecting the common interests of many parties.

Each partner offers unique strengths and abilities to assist each mode to deliver its programs and leverage resources in protecting the public on the Nation’s roadways.&amp;nbsp; Progress toward a national roadway safety goal requires collaboration with a diverse group of stakeholders and partners across a range of disciplines.&amp;nbsp; The agencies within DOT work with a network of partner organizations, such as State Highway Safety Offices, State transportation departments, Tribal governments, local and county traffic engineers, law enforcement agencies, public health associations, safety advocacy groups, the motorcoach industry, hazardous shipping businesses, interstate trucking operations and the auto industry on the development of evidence-based roadway safety programs, projects, and safety standards.&amp;nbsp; Such collaboration will help to integrate a broad range of factors affecting roadway safety and create more efficient and effective problem-solving synergies across the transportation industry.

Challenges:

A number of challenges could slow down or even reverse positive trends.&amp;nbsp; Many States continue to face budget shortfalls and are under tremendous pressure to reduce services, resulting in cut backs to roadway safety programs.&amp;nbsp; Cutbacks in State, Tribal and local law enforcement agency budgets could weaken national enforcement campaigns and local traffic safety enforcement efforts.&amp;nbsp; States, Tribes, and local governments must be willing to use data-driven analytical processes to make the best and most effective safety investments.

Distracted driving has emerged as a new threat over the past few years as the rise of portable electronic devices has swiftly expanded.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Moreover, as in-vehicle electronic systems become ever more sophisticated and complex, distracted driving could become an even greater threat if it is not addressed in a manner keeping pace with technological advancements.&amp;nbsp; In fact, a new report by the Governors' Highway Safety Association (GHSA) cites 50 percent of the US adult population now owning smartphones and the wireless industry reports a subscription penetration rate of 102.2 percent (^1).&amp;nbsp; Also, as the economy continues to gain momentum, more recreational travel and driving may lead to higher crash rates.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Additionally, safety defects in vehicles that are not addressed in a safe and efficient manner can lead toward more serious vehicle crashes and injuries.&amp;nbsp; Finally, the repeal of proven life-saving traffic safety laws at the State level, such as universal motorcycle helmet or primary seat belt laws, could also result in higher injuries and fatalities.&amp;nbsp; Nevertheless, significant opportunities remain for continued progress in reducing roadway fatalities.&amp;nbsp; The Department will seek new and innovative ways to serve the American people and keep our roadways safe.

The FAST Act, Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act, was signed into law by President Obama on December 4, 2015.&amp;nbsp; With the passage of the FAST Act, all DOT surface operating administrations have been updating their implementation plans to accommodate the new requirements and authorities contained in the act. This five-year reauthorization bill includes additional motor vehicle safety measures, such as the authority to prohibit rental car companies from knowingly renting vehicles that are subject to safety recalls.&amp;nbsp; It also increased maximum fines against non-compliant auto manufactures from $35 million to $105 million.&amp;nbsp; The law also will help streamlines the Federal truck and bus safety grant programs, giving more flexibility to States to improve safety in these areas. &amp;nbsp;

</objective_statement><objective_overview>Based on current economic and demographic forecasts, it is likely that the movement of people and goods within the U.S. and abroad will continue to increase and the transportation sector will continue to enable economic growth and job creation.  The transportation sector contributed approximately $1.466 trillion, or 9.7 percent, to GDP in 2011.  Our Nation must make strategic investments that enable the movement of people and goods more efficiently with full utilization of the existing capacity across all transportation modes. The cornerstones of this strategy are investments in high-performance passenger rail, the development of a national freight strategy, investments in public transportation, mitigating traffic congestion on our highways, and implementing NextGen to improve operations and alleviate airport congestion.
</objective_overview></Strategic_Objective><Strategic_Objective><id>5061</id><objective_header>IMPROVE SAFETY OF TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM </objective_header><objective_statement>Improve the safety of the transportation system across all modes of travel by addressing behavioral, vehicular, and infrastructure safety issues through prevention, mitigation, data sharing and analysis, and response using innovative and effective partnerships, programs, and resources.
</objective_statement><objective_overview>In 2011, 34,414 people died and more than 2.2 million people were injured in transportation-related crashes and accidents, according to U.S. DOT national Transportation Statistics.  Motor vehicle crashes caused 32,367 fatalities, or 94 percent of the total, even though the rate of fatalities per hundred million miles of travel was the lowest ever recorded in the United States.  Distracted driving was a contributing factor in at least 3,331 fatal crashes.  Another 1, 213 people died in rail, air, and transit accidents.  We will use our safety programs and regulations for automobiles, airplanes, railroads, trucks, motorcoaches, pipelines, and hazardous materials as effectively as possible to reduce crashes, fatalities, and injuries, and will expand safety oversight to public transit.  We will continue to direct federal resources to address the most serious safety risks and implement program reforms that will advance our safety mission. Between 2001 and 2010, an average of 13 people in the United States died every year in incidents related to the transportation of hazardous material—a rate of one death for every 21 billion ton-miles of hazardous material moved.  In addition to causing deaths and injuries, hazardous material transportation incidents disrupt communities when people are evacuated from their homes, business activity is curtailed, and transportation services are interrupted.  We will continue to develop and encourage the use of safety tools - such as improved data collection, risk management practices, and incident response planning - to prevent, mitigate, and respond to hazardous material transportation accidents.
