</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>At the heart of HHS’s strategy to strengthen and modernize healthcare is the use of data to improve healthcare quality, reduce unnecessary healthcare costs, decrease paperwork, expand access to affordable care, improve population health, and support reformed payment structures. The nation’s health information technology infrastructure enables the flow of information to power these critical efforts—&amp;nbsp;that can help facilitate&amp;nbsp;the types of fundamental changes in access and healthcare delivery proposed in the Affordable Care Act. HHS is taking a leading role in realizing health information technology’s potential benefits. The Recovery Act provided an unprecedented investment in health information technology to propel a range of initiatives, including regulations on the meaningful use of health information technology and standards as well as the funding of Health IT Regional Extension Centers, State Health Information Exchanges, and other programs.

This Priority Goal is to increase the number of eligible providers in these important programs who adopt/meaningfully use electronic health records&amp;nbsp;(EHRs), since it is believed that the increased use of EHRs will improve coordination across providers and settings, improve health care delivery,&amp;nbsp;improve quality of care and reduce medical errors. The Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT within the Office of the Secretary of Health and Human Services is the designated lead for this priority goal in close partnership with the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services (CMS). A key step in this strategy is to provide incentive payments to eligible providers serving Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries who adopt and meaningfully use certified EHR technology.

Detailed reports showing the provider types and EHR Incentive Programs breakouts are available on the CMS website at http://www.cms.gov/EHRIncentivePrograms/56_DataAndReports.asp
