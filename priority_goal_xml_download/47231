	Decrease by 10% the total morphine milligram equivalents (MME) dispensed in the U.S. outpatient retail pharmacy setting.
	Increase by 15% the number of prescriptions dispensed for naloxone in the U.S. outpatient retail pharmacy setting
	Increase by 10% the number of unique patients receiving prescriptions for buprenorphine and naltrexone in the U.S. outpatient retail pharmacy setting.

</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Opioid abuse and overdose present a nationwide public health challenge. Death by drug overdose is the leading cause of injury death in the United States, with deaths from opioids in particular increasing precipitously in the twenty-first century. Overdose deaths from prescription opioids, such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, and morphine, have more than quadrupled over the period 1999-2013. Overdose deaths involving heroin have increased significantly in recent years, more than tripling from 2010-20141. Agencies across HHS recognize the urgency of halting the rise of opioid use disorder and overdose, and are working to develop and implement the most effective interventions, from prevention through treatment.

&amp;nbsp;

In March of 2015, HHS Secretary Burwell introduced the Secretary’s Opioid Initiative to accelerate progress toward two broad goals: 1) decreasing opioid overdoses and overall overdose mortality and 2) decreasing the prevalence of opioid use disorder. This unifying strategy is designed to focus implementation efforts on action steps most likely to yield rapid and meaningful results. Specifically, the Initiative focuses on the three areas of reforming of opioid prescribing practices to reduce excess prescribing; improving naloxone development, access, and distribution; and expanding access to medication-assisted treatment (MAT). This Agency Priority Goal (APG) and accompanying metrics align with the three emphasis areas of the Initiative. Further, this opioid APG represents targeted assessment of the near-term progress that will be essential for achieving the broader Initiative goals of overall reduction in the morbidity and mortality associated with opioid use.&amp;nbsp;

Coordinated efforts to improve prescriber training, increase access to naloxone and MAT, forge public/private partnerships and launch public awareness campaigns comprise the activities of the ongoing HHS and White House opioid initiatives. Upcoming steps include:


	Publication of the Surgeon General’s Report. In November 2016, the Office of the Surgeon General will release the first-ever Surgeon General's Report presenting the state of the science on substance use, addiction, and health. The report will examine the health effects of drug and alcohol misuse from the perspectives of prevention, treatment, recovery, neurobiology, and delivery of care.
	Report to Congress. In November 2016, HHS will submit a report to Congress in accordance with the Protecting Our Infants Act, which will document activities throughout the Department related to neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), including research and programmatic gaps associated with addressing NAS, and recommendations for filling these gaps.
	PDMP Health IT Integration Initiative. The ONC PDMP and Health IT Integration Initiative, which seeks to solve the technical challenges to integrating PDMP data with health IT systems, will develop an Implementation Guide to allow health IT developers to follow standardized implementation steps in order to make PDMP data accessible with health IT systems and applications.
	Guidance Development. Guidance will be developed for Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assistants on how to become waivered to prescribe buprenorphine as part of medication-assisted treatment as authorized by the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) of 2016.
	Section 1115 Demonstrations. CMS will support state efforts to introduce substance use delivery system reforms through a Section 1115 demonstration initiative with the goal of developing comprehensive strategies to ensure a full continuum of services, integrating primary care and mental health treatment. States will also be supported in developing new payment mechanisms and performance quality initiatives.
	Opioid Initiative Funding. Funding awarded in FY2016 provided targeted support for ongoing programs contributing to the goal of reduced opioid morbidity and mortality, including:
	
		The Substance Abuse Service Expansion Supplement Funding from HRSA to improve and expand delivery of opioid use disorder treatment services at existing health centers, with an emphasis on MAT.
		The CDC funding award to states, Enhanced State Surveillance of Opioid-Involved Morbidity and Mortality, to improve the timeliness of fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose reporting.
		The CDC funding award to states, Prescription Drug Overdose: Data-Driven Prevention Initiative, to advance and evaluate state-level prevention for opioid overuse, misuse, abuse, and overdose.
		SAMHSA Grants to Prevent Prescription Drug/Opioid Overdose-Related Deaths (PDO) Cooperative Agreement, to reduce the number of prescription drug/opioid overdose-related deaths and adverse events.
		SAMHSA Strategic Prevention Framework for Prescription Drugs (SPF Rx) Cooperative Agreement, to target the priority issue of prescription drug misuse.
		NIDA services planning research grants to address a dramatic increase in adverse outcomes associated with increased opioid injection drug use in Appalachia (in partnership with the Appalachian Regional Commission).
	
	
	NIDA, SAMHSA, and CDC, in partnership with the Appalachian Regional Commission, will fund an initiative to help find solutions to the opioid use and overdose crisis in the nation’s rural regions. It will support comprehensive, integrated approaches to prevent opioid injection and its consequences, including substance use disorder, overdose, and infectious diseases. These projects will work with state and local communities to develop best practice responses to opioid injection epidemics that can be implemented by public health systems in the Nation’s rural communities.
	On October 19 and 20, FDA, with assistance from SAMHSA and NIDA, held a code-a-thon on the FDA campus with the objective of spurring the development of crowd-sourced mobile phone app to connect those experiencing an opioid overdose with carriers of naloxone.&amp;nbsp; Competition entries are due November 7.
	On October 5, FDA held an Advisory Committee meeting exploring the appropriate dose of naloxone treatment for opioid overdose.

</next_steps><progress_update>Analysis of prescription data from IMS Health provided to ASPE and FDA demonstrated the following:


	52,680,388,425 total morphine milligram equivalents (MME) were dispensed in the outpatient US retail pharmacy setting in 2Q2016, representing a 5 percent decrease from 4Q2015 (the quarter preceding the start of this Agency Priority Goal).

	New MAT Waivers. A final SAMHSA rule increasing the highest limit for the number of patients to whom a DATA-Act-waivered physician can prescribe buprenorphine for medication-assisted treatment will be implemented, including the review and approval of new waivers.


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
</progress_update><themes><theme>Health</theme></themes><contributing_programs_and_other_factors>The HHS Operating and Staff Divisions that will report data metrics and provide goal leadership for the opioid APG are: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),&amp;nbsp; the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).

&amp;nbsp;

Efforts toward the APG will take place across HHS, as the APG represents an intermediate step toward the larger goal of the Secretary’s Opioid Initiative. The Secretary’s Initiative is coordinated through the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE), and partner agencies include the Agency for Healthcare and Research Quality (AHRQ), CDC, CMS, FDA, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), NIDA, ONC, and SAMHSA. Additional efforts are taking place within the Indian Health Service (IHS).

&amp;nbsp;

Other agencies outside HHS are also working to combat opioid abuse and overdose, including:


	the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), through their Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention Plan


&amp;nbsp;the Department of Justice (DOJ), through their naloxone toolkit for law enforcement and bureau of prisons (BOP) MAT pilot program&amp;nbsp;
