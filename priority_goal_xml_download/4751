</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Air traffic control systems can improve the efficiency of airspace. As of December 2014, ERAM achieved Initial Operation Capability at all 20 Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs).&amp;nbsp; By March 2015, all 20 Air Route Traffic Control Centers will have achieved Operational Readiness Date (ORD) for ERAM.

The En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) System replaces the 40-year-old En Route HOST Computer System and backup system used at 20 FAA ARTCCs around the country.&amp;nbsp; ERAM is the main computer system air traffic controllers use to guide airplanes flying at high altitudes.&amp;nbsp; Air traffic control towers, terminal radar approach control facilities, the Air Traffic Control System Command Center, flight service stations, and other agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense, all connect to and use the information managed by the En Route HOST Computer System.&amp;nbsp; The original HOST computer software architecture was developed in the late 1960s and was implemented as National Airspace System (NAS) Stage A in the early 1970s.

For controllers, ERAM provides a user-friendly interface with customizable displays.&amp;nbsp; Trajectory modeling is more accurate than in HOST, allowing maximum airspace use, better conflict detection, and improved decision making.&amp;nbsp; ERAM will substantially increase the number of flights that can be tracked and displayed to controllers from 1,100 to 1,900.&amp;nbsp; The ERAM system also provides two functionally identical channels with dual redundancy, providing a more robust back-up capability than today's environment.&amp;nbsp; Coverage will also extend beyond facility boundaries, enabling controllers to handle additional traffic more efficiently because ERAM is designed to process data from up to 64 radars instead of the current 24.&amp;nbsp; The ERAM system is needed to replace the current HOST system and allow the FAA to continue to provide the high level of safe, reliable air traffic control services that the nation has come to expect; and also put in place the infrastructure necessary to transition the NAS to NextGen.

Target has been met for FY 2015: Completed as of the end of the 2nd quarter of FY2015, the program has met its FY2015 goals of achieving ORD at the final four sites.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The four remaining sites were: New York (ZNY), Washington (ZDC), Atlanta (ZTL), and Jacksonville (ZJX). Status:


	New York (ZNY) –reached ORD on March 26, 2015;
	Washington (ZDC) –reached ORD on March 27, 2015;
	Atlanta (ZTL) –reached ORD on March 10, 2015; and
	Jacksonville (ZJX) –reached ORD on February 27, 2015.

FAA Air Traffic Organization (ATO) controls civil, military and commercial aviation traffic through US airspace. ATO also maintains the systems that support air traffic control and communications between pilots and manages the development of new air traffic control systems. ATO provides weather and safety advisories and other flight planning support to pilots.

Facilities and Equipment (F&amp;amp;E): Engineering, Development, Test and Evaluation 

FAA’s Engineering, Development Test and Evaluation, which is referred to as F&amp;amp;E Activity 1 in the budget, includes pre-acquisition NextGen F&amp;amp;E programs, continuing basic research programs, and laboratory support for the William J. Hughes Technical Center. Activity 1 programs support the initial design, engineering, development, test and evaluation activities associated with producing end-product systems, technologies, and capabilities for the National Airspace System (NAS). This includes the development of operational concepts and proof-of-concept systems and equipment and their demonstration in the laboratory and limited operational settings. Funding supports initial research through early development to concept demonstration, but ends prior to an investment decision for production and implementation across the NAS.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Our goal is to support the U.S. economy by fostering strategic investments that will serve the traveling public and facilitate freight movement now and in the future. Transportation enables economic activity, quality of life, connected communities, and ladders of opportunity to education, opportunities, and services. In order to support the lives and economies of neighborhoods, regions, and the Nation, we must invest wisely in transportation. Our central strategies for achieving maximum economic returns on our policies and investments include leading the development of intercity, high-speed passenger rail and a competitive air transportation system; increasing travel time reliability in freight-significant highway corridors; improving the performance of freight rail and maritime networks; advancing transportation interests in targeted markets around the world; expanding opportunities in the transportation sector for small businesses; and creating a dynamic workforce.

</objective_statement><objective_overview>Based on current economic and demographic forecasts, it is likely that the movement of people and goods within the U.S. and abroad will continue to increase and the transportation sector will continue to enable economic growth and job creation.  The transportation sector contributed approximately $1.466 trillion, or 9.7 percent, to GDP in 2011.  Our Nation must make strategic investments that enable the movement of people and goods more efficiently with full utilization of the existing capacity across all transportation modes. The cornerstones of this strategy are investments in high-performance passenger rail, the development of a national freight strategy, investments in public transportation, mitigating traffic congestion on our highways, and implementing NextGen to improve operations and alleviate airport congestion.
