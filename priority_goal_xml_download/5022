	Incorporate science user facility prioritization into program planning efforts
	Identify programmatic drivers and technical requirements in coordination with other Departmental mission areas to inform future development of high performance computing capabilities and in anticipation of capable exascale systems

</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>The Office of Science (SC) mission is to deliver the scientific discoveries and major scientific tools that transform our understanding of nature and advance the energy, economic, and national security of the United States. The Office of Science accomplishes its mission and advances national goals by:


	Supporting a balanced research portfolio that invests in discovery science—research that probes some of the most fundamental questions in high energy, nuclear, and plasma physics; materials and chemistry; biological systems and earth system components; and mathematics.&amp;nbsp; The Office of Science supports about 24,000 investigators at over 300 U.S. academic institutions and at all of the DOE laboratories.
	Providing the Nation’s researchers with over 30 state-of-the-art national scientific user facilities, the most advanced tools of modern science, enabling the U.S. to remain at the forefront of science, technology, and innovation. The Office of Science also supports targeted research and development (R&amp;amp;D), to determine the technical feasibility and design options for future facilities and facility upgrades to deliver desired capabilities and maximize scientific potential.&amp;nbsp; Nearly 27,000 researchers from universities, national laboratories, industry, and international partners are expected to use the Office of Science scientific user facilities by FY&amp;nbsp;2015.

Q4&amp;nbsp;FY15 Actual:&amp;nbsp; Indicator completed.&amp;nbsp; FY16 President’s budget request includes support for SC user facilities based on the prioritization listing. &amp;nbsp;

Indicator 2: Identify programmatic drivers and technical requirements in coordination with other stakeholders to inform development of high performance computing capabilities and in anticipation of capable exascale systems by 2015.&amp;nbsp;

Q4 FY15 Target:&amp;nbsp; Deliver to the Secretary a conceptual design document that identifies programmatic drivers and technical requirements to achieve higher levels of computing in anticipation of the capabilities that a capable exascale computing system would provide.

Q4 FY15 Actual. The preliminary conceptual design document for the exascale initiative, which identifies drivers and technical requirements to achieve the Department’s exascale goals and incorporates interagency and community (through the ASCAC) comments, was delivered to the Secretary’s chief scientist and senior advisor to S-1 and NNSA, on September 30, 2015. The Exascale Computing Initiative (ECI)&amp;nbsp;Review Subcommittee Response to ECI conceptual design review charge can be viewed at:&amp;nbsp;
