</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Support the Quadrennial Energy Review (QER):

Innovation and new sources of domestic energy supply are transforming the nation’s energy marketplace, creating economic opportunities at the same time they raise environmental challenges. To ensure that federal energy policy meets our economic, environmental, and security goals in this changing landscape, the Administration will conduct a Quadrennial Energy Review which will be led by the White House Domestic Policy Council and Office of Science and Technology Policy, supported by a Secretariat established at the Department of Energy, and involving the robust engagement of federal agencies and outside stakeholders. This first-ever review will focus on infrastructure challenges, and will identify the threats, risks, and opportunities for U.S. energy and climate security, enabling the federal government to translate policy goals into a set of analytically based, clearly articulated, sequenced and integrated actions, and proposed investments over a four-year planning horizon.

These efforts included strong input from the White House and Congress as well as interagency partners.&amp;nbsp; Congressional committees have held three hearings on QER recommendations as they prepare energy legislation in both the House and Senate.&amp;nbsp; In addition, the White House and the Secretary of Energy announced that the second installment of the QER (1.2) will be conducted as a comprehensive analysis of the electricity sector.&amp;nbsp; EPSA began scoping the analysis of this report including the development of policy questions and statements of work. &amp;nbsp;

In the same quarter, DOE and partners finished their work on the Accelerating Energy Productivity 2030 initiative to advance the President’s goal of doubling U.S. energy productivity by 2030.

The Quadrennial Energy Review


	May: Started to implement the recommendations laid out in the QER.&amp;nbsp; These implementation strategies include:
	
		- Budget requests in FY16 and FY17
		- Technical assistance on draft legislation
		- Funding of contracted and internal analysis
		- Interagency collaboration
		- Stakeholder engagement
	
	
	September: White House announced the next installment of the QER will be conducted on electricity


Accelerating Energy Productivity


	July: DOE co-sponsored an advanced manufacturing roundtable in Minneapolis, Minnesota in partnership with the Alliance to Save Energy and the Council on Competitiveness.
	September: On September 16th, DOE co-hosted, with the Alliance to Save Energy and the Council on Competitiveness, the Accelerate Energy Productivity 2030 Summit.&amp;nbsp; During the Summit Secretary Moniz released the Accelerate Energy Productivity by 2030 Roadmap.&amp;nbsp; This action completed the obligations for this initiative as laid out in the President’s Climate Action Plan.
	Released the Accelerate Energy Productivity by 2030 Roadmap.&amp;nbsp;Began to implement recommendations laid out in the first installment of the QER regarding energy transmission, storage, and distribution.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;


DOE is preparing for the 2nd QER on the Electircity System in FY16.
</progress_update><themes><theme>Energy</theme></themes><contributing_programs_and_other_factors>The Department of Energy has a broad role in energy policy development and the largest role in implementing the Federal Government's energy research and development portfolio. Many other executive departments and agencies also play key roles in developing and implementing policies governing energy resources and consumption, as well as associated environmental impacts. In addition, non-Federal actors are crucial contributors to energy policies. Because most energy and related infrastructure is owned by private entities, investment by and engagement of the private sector is necessary to develop and implement effective policies. State and local policies; the views of nongovernmental, environmental, faith-based, labor, and other social organizations; and contributions from the academic and non-profit sectors are also critical to the development and implementation of effective energy policies. An interagency Quadrennial Energy Review Task Force, which includes members from all relevant executive departments and agencies, will develop an integrated review of energy policy and offer recommendations on what additional actions it believes would be appropriate.

</objective_statement><objective_overview>The nation’s transformation to a clean energy economy requires a modern energy infrastructure that can integrate a diverse energy portfolio, respond to and recover rapidly from disruptions, and deliver highly reliable and affordable energy. As called for in the Climate Action Plan, a modernized energy infrastructure also must become more resilient to prepare the United States for the impacts of climate change. In a clean energy economy, communications and control technologies that support the development and integration of variable energy resources become more critical, and DOE will seek pathways that expand the use of dispatchable renewable energy including hydropower, energy storage, and demand response capabilities. While advanced intelligent devices and communications networks improve the visibility, response, and control of energy systems, they also can increase the exposure to cyber attacks. DOE will focus on addressing and helping to manage the increased vulnerability of the nation’s energy infrastructures due to climate change, cyber vulnerabilities, physical vulnerabilities, and infrastructure interdependencies.
DOE will facilitate the market-readiness of DOE-supported technologies and address non-technical barriers that will enable the marketplace to better understand the cost-saving and environmental benefits of these energy solutions, including engaging the future clean energy workforce.
