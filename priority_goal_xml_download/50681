By September 30, 2017, U.S. assistance to end preventable child and maternal deaths will reduce under-five mortality in 24 Maternal and Child Health U.S. Government-priority countries by three deaths per 1,000 live births as compared to a baseline of 2015.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>USAID with its partners in the U.S. Government (USG) and the global community are committed to the goal of ending preventable child and maternal deaths.&amp;nbsp; While many challenges remain, today more than ever, we are equipped with the tools and knowledge to reach this goal. Child deaths nearly halved from 1990 to 2013, saving an estimated 100 million child lives. Maternal deaths decreased by 45 percent over the same period. Between 2001 and 2013, malaria mortality rates decreased globally by 47 percent and by 54 percent in Africa alone. Estimates indicate that more than four million global malaria-related deaths were averted, primarily in children under five in Africa.&amp;nbsp; Rates of modern contraceptive use have increased from 12 percent in 1990 to 31 percent in 2013 in the countries with the largest USAID-supported programs, enabling healthy timing and spacing of pregnancies, which could lower child deaths by 25 percent and cut maternal deaths by 30 percent.&amp;nbsp; USAID reduced stunting, caused by a lack of essential vitamins and nutrients during early years and by frequent illness that robs growing bodies of the capacity to utilize available nutrients, from 55.6 percent in 1990 to 37.7 percent in 2014 in its 19 nutrition-focus countries.&amp;nbsp;

To continue progress on these issues, USAID focuses its work to end preventable child and maternal deaths in 24 high burden countries around the world.&amp;nbsp; These 24 countries account for approximately 70 percent of maternal and child deaths and 50 percent of the global unmet need for family planning.&amp;nbsp; USAID selected these countries because of the magnitude and severity of child and maternal deaths, high country commitment, and the greatest potential to leverage U.S. Government programs, as well as those of other partners and donors.

By analyzing the causes of child and maternal death and the current coverage of life-saving interventions, USAID has identified the investments that will have the greatest impact. In the Acting on the Call&amp;nbsp;report, released in June 2014, USAID developed a plan of action for the 24 priority countries.&amp;nbsp; These plans quantified the potential impact on lives saved if USAID scaled high impact interventions at rates previously achieved by countries with similar characteristics (so-called “best performers”).&amp;nbsp; This information allows the global community to sharpen implementation of these high-impact interventions and align investments for maximum efficiency.

</next_steps><progress_update>Overview

USAID, with its partners in the U.S. Government and the global community, is committed to the goal of ending preventable child and maternal deaths (EPCMD).&amp;nbsp; All women deserve to give birth safely, and all children — no matter where they are born — deserve the same chance to survive and thrive.

Over the past two and a half decades, the world has reduced child mortality by more than half, and maternal mortality by nearly as much.&amp;nbsp; This means that 18,000 more children and 650 more mothers will survive today, than each day in 1990.&amp;nbsp; Despite this progress, 5.9 million children under age five still die each year, almost 1 million of them on their first day of life, and 303,000 women die annually during what should be one of the happiest days in their life.&amp;nbsp; The vast majority of these deaths are caused by complications and illnesses for which there are known, affordable treatments.&amp;nbsp;

USAID focuses on ending preventable child and maternal deaths in the following 25 priority countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Haiti, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Rwanda, Senegal, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Yemen, and Zambia.&amp;nbsp; USAID chose these countries based on highest need, demonstrable commitment, and the greatest opportunity to save lives.&amp;nbsp; In priority countries, USAID is working with national governments, partners, civil society, and faith based organizations to support national health plans and improve access to quality services for women and children.&amp;nbsp; Notably, all fiscal year (FY) 2016 results reflect progress in USAID’s 24 priority countries (excluding Myanmar, as data are not yet available).&amp;nbsp; USAID’s approach to ending preventable child and maternal deaths, as outlined in the Acting on the Call Report, is informed by the documented successes of countries that have adopted effective interventions, buoyed by the momentum to reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and poised for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).&amp;nbsp; The U.S. Government’s contributions to global efforts are evident in the millions of child and maternal lives saved during the past six years.

Ending preventable child and maternal deaths is not an outcome of U.S. Government assistance alone, nor is it solely the outcome of narrowly defined programs in maternal and child health (MCH).&amp;nbsp; Rather, improvements in mortality outcomes are the result of increasingly effective efforts to link diverse health programs –MCH, malaria, family planning, nutrition, HIV/AIDS, and sanitation and hygiene.&amp;nbsp; All of these efforts contribute to ending preventable child and maternal deaths.

In FY 2016, USAID reached a global coverage across its 24 USAID-priority countries for the percentage of births attended by a skilled doctor, nurse, or midwife (SBA) to 54.1 percent, and the percentage of children receiving the third dose of diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough) and tetanus vaccine (DPT3) to 81 percent.&amp;nbsp; While the Agency met its target for DPT3 and increased coverage for SBA, it did not achieve the target of increasing SBA coverage by 1 percent every year.&amp;nbsp; While USAID devotes significant resources to ensuring universal coverage and high quality care to all mothers and children, the difficulty in achieving higher coverage of skilled birth attendance cannot be underestimated, given the significant challenges of sufficiently training and maintaining critical staff, as well as supporting health facilities and systems.&amp;nbsp;

Another major component of EPCMD is ensuring access to family planning contraceptives.&amp;nbsp; By enabling women and couples to practice healthy timing and spacing of pregnancies and providing family planning commodities, family planning could reduce maternal deaths by 30 percent and child deaths by 25 percent globally.&amp;nbsp; USAID’s Family Planning/Reproductive Health 24 priority countries align with EPCMD countries, including: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Haiti, India, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, Rwanda, Senegal, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Yemen, and Zambia.&amp;nbsp; The average use of modern contraceptives in these priority countries increased by 1.4 percent in FY 2016 (exceeding the target of 1 percentage point by 40 percent).&amp;nbsp; Use of modern contraceptives is a high impact intervention, which reduces unintended pregnancies and abortion rates.&amp;nbsp; Similarly, in FY 2016 quarter four (Q4), USAID again exceeded its target by delivering 94 percent of purchased contraceptive commodities on time (4 percentage points above the target).&amp;nbsp; Timely delivery of commodities was due to proactive measures taken by the Agency to prevent delays.

As a result of USAID’s support to malaria programs and coordination with other major donors including the Global Fund, the World Bank, and UNICEF, 17 of the 19 President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI) focus countries in Africa show significant declines, ranging from 8 percent to 67 percent, in all-cause mortality rates among children under five years of age.&amp;nbsp; The support for insecticide treated nets scale-up alone resulted in over 72 million people protected in FY 2015.&amp;nbsp; While results are not yet available for FY 2016, USAID continues to support malaria programs in coordination with other major donors, including the Global Fund, the World Bank, and UNICEF, to ensure hundreds of millions of people benefit from protective measures and diagnosis and treatment for malaria.

USAID continues to employ data-driven decision-making to sharpen programming; USAID’s annual review of Mission Health Implementation Plans (HIPs), strategic plans for use of FY 2016 funds, is underway.&amp;nbsp; The HIP review process this year successfully ensured that programs, budgets, and implementing mechanisms were aligned with Agency health priorities and supported state-of-the-art, evidence-based programs.&amp;nbsp; The reviews assessed whether Mission and headquarter interventions optimally address the key drivers of morbidity and mortality, with clear linkages to evidence-based national or regional strategies.&amp;nbsp; In addition, reviews focused on how operating units work with partner governments, regional organizations, other donors and partners to leverage resources, ensure sustainability, and build country ownership.&amp;nbsp; As a result, USAID is well positioned to accelerate sustainable reductions in child and maternal mortality.

Finally, USAID uses integrated management to address complex health issues, analyzing trends in global health data, and working with missions across the world to monitor performance and apply strategic planning, core program analytics, and other pertinent information to reaffirm a multidisciplinary and cross-sectoral approach toward USAID’s priority health goals.&amp;nbsp; The Bureau for Global Health continues to monitor over 100 indicators across more than 60 countries.&amp;nbsp; In addition, Technical Officers across the Bureau for Global Health worked with missions, and their partners, to utilize results, identify gaps and address technical assistance needs.

Explanation of Results

Ending preventable child and maternal deaths requires a health service delivery system that provides high quality, equitable, and sustainable essential services to women, newborns, and children.&amp;nbsp; USAID’s equity-focused approach prioritizes services for the poorest and the most marginalized.&amp;nbsp; Work in health governance that equips local governments to effectively plan, manage, and finance high-quality maternal and child services and commodities supports this approach.

The procurement and shipment of family planning commodities is central to USAID’s efforts to address the unmet need for family planning in USAID-supported countries.&amp;nbsp; USAID advances and supports family planning/reproductive health programs worldwide through:&amp;nbsp; field-driven program design and implementation, efficient service and commodity delivery, comprehensive technical support, timely and authoritative research, global leadership, and high-impact partnerships.

In FY 2016 Q4, despite a transition from the USAID | DELIVER Project to the Global Health Supply Chain - Procurement and Supply Management Program, on- time shipments again exceeded the target value.&amp;nbsp; USAID achieved this by taking proactive measures to prevent delays in delivering contraceptive shipments to missions and programs.&amp;nbsp; In addition to utilizing FY 2016 Q3 improvements in global supply chain operation, USAID also enacted weekly transition management meetings and consistently followed up with programs to mitigate impact to the field.

Challenges and Opportunities

USAID continues to address bottlenecks and identify challenges that impact results so that it can ensure family planning commodities continue to be available where needed.&amp;nbsp; In the delivery of family planning commodities, pre-clearance, custom clearance and manufacturing delays vary from country to country and can affect the timely shipment of procurements.&amp;nbsp; Overcoming these obstacles involves working closely with other USAID projects, missions, and partner country governments; the introduction of new in-country clearance agents better equipped to manage the clearance process; a change in the shipping lane assignment; and adjustment of the order lead times for procurement planning purposes.&amp;nbsp;

Contributing programs or partners outside the agency:&amp;nbsp; The USAID Assistant Administrator for Global Health and Child and Maternal Health Coordinator leads efforts to achieve the Global Health Agency Priority Goal. &amp;nbsp;Several other U.S. Government initiatives contribute to this effort, including the President's Emergency Plan for HIV/AIDS Relief, and FTF. The Department of State, the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Peace Corps, and the Millennium Challenge Corporation are also key partners and contributors. USAID also works closely with host country governments, key international bilateral and multilateral partners, nongovernmental organizations, and for-profit partners to achieve these goals.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Deploying diplomats and development experts on the frontlines today is cheaper than deploying troops tomorrow.  This is why we are acting on several fronts to make investments that strengthen the impact of America’s foreign policy on our greatest strategic challenges.  We know the difference that the United States can make around the world, and we must continue to deliver diplomatic, security, development, and humanitarian solutions that match the scale of the challenges we face.
The challenges we face are great, many, and span the globe.  Whether it be providing care and treatment for HIV/AIDS and malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, strengthening judicial institutions in Latin America, building trust and combating extremism in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or joining with our European partners to deliver humanitarian assistance where disaster strikes, the United States is at work in every region of the world.  In all that we do, we are partnering with the United Nations and other international organizations, whose cooperation is critical to our success.
While the men and women of the Department of State and USAID are active worldwide, a few strategic challenges are singled out in this report because they exemplify our commitment to building performance capabilities and to measuring and reporting on our performance.  These challenges are:  building a new stability in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA); rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific; preventing and responding to crises and conflict, and providing humanitarian assistance to those in need; and combating challenges to global security and health.
Success in building a new stability in the MENA region is essential to U.S. global interests.  The region is in the midst of transition and crisis, and poses some of the most immediate challenges for U.S. national security.  The United States “rebalance” to the Asia-Pacific reflects a profound recognition that the security and prosperity of our nation will be shaped by developments in that region.  Home to two-thirds of the world’s people and many of its fastest growing economies, the Asia-Pacific presents both opportunities and challenges for U.S. strategic and economic interests.  A transatlantic renaissance in relations with European allies and partners is essential to successfully confronting global challenges, as well as shaping and defending international institutions and norms in line with our shared, democratic, free-market values.
In addition, more than 1.5 billion people worldwide live in fragile or conflict-affected states, or in countries trapped in cycles of violence.  When states cannot control their territory, protect their people, support sustainable growth, or help those in need, the resulting instability disrupts economic activity and fosters permissive environments for violent extremists and weapons proliferation. 
We must meet these and other global security and health challenges that affect international stability and prosperity, and threaten U.S. interests.  These challenges include securing the world’s most dangerous weapons; investing in rule of law; securing borders and combating transnational organized crime; and countering cyber threats.  And we must continue to work with bilateral and multilateral partners to strengthen health systems in developing countries, create an AIDS-free generation, end preventable child and maternal deaths, and reduce the threat of infectious diseases.
</strategic_goal_overview><strategic_goal_sequence>2</strategic_goal_sequence></Strategic_Goal></Strategic_Goals><Strategic_Objectives><Strategic_Objective><id>2285</id><objective_header>Strengthen America’s Efforts to Combat Global Health Challenges</objective_header><objective_statement></objective_statement><objective_overview>U.S. efforts to improve global health advance our broader development goals and national security interests, and are a concrete expression of our humanitarian values.  The State Department and USAID use diplomacy and foreign assistance programs to address U.S. government goals of creating an AIDS-free generation, ending preventable child and maternal deaths, and reducing the threat of infectious diseases.  The U.S. government partners with multilateral institutions, donor nations, and other organizations to encourage and empower developing countries to build strong, sustainable health care systems.  Expanding health care capacity abroad is essential to long-term development.  Health is the largest component of U.S. development assistance.
U.S. investments that result in healthier people make for stronger, more prosperous, and more stable countries; they enhance international security and trade; and they ensure a safer, more resilient America.  Despite successes in addressing health challenges in recent decades, in some places progress remains far too slow.  Much remains to be done to strengthen health systems in developing countries and address HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and maternal and child mortality.  In 2012, 6.6 million children under the age of five died, many from preventable causes.  Infectious, life-threatening diseases such as pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria are exacerbated by malnutrition and poor access to health services.  Infectious disease outbreaks, whether naturally caused, intentionally produced, or accidentally released, remain among the foremost dangers to human health and the global economy.  Many countries have limited capacity to prevent, detect, and rapidly respond to these threats.
Strategies for Achieving the Objective
The U.S. government has more than 10 years of experience in helping countries to rapidly expand HIV prevention, treatment, and care services through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). PEPFAR's current strategy, PEPFAR 3.0 - Controlling the Epidemic: Delivering on the Promise of an AIDS-Free Generation, showcases PEPFAR’s design to support the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)ambitious 90-90-90 global goals: 90 percent of all people living with HIV will know their HIV status; 90 percent of all people with diagnosed HIV infection will receive sustained antiretroviral therapy; and 90 percent of all people receiving antiretroviral therapy will have viral suppression by 2020.  This new focus requires a shift in business practices, pivoting to a data-driven approach that strategically targets geographical areas and populations where we can achieve the most impact for our investments.  The PEPFAR 3.0 strategy makes clear that the United States' commitment to this goal will remain strong, comprehensive, and driven by science. Importantly, this framework emphasizes impact, efficiency, sustainability, partnership, and human rights as core agendas to create an AIDS-free generation.
In 2012, the U.S. government joined more than 175 countries and 400 civil society and faith organizations in pledging to end preventable child deaths worldwide by 2035, as part of the Call to Action for Child Survival.  The Call to Action joins related efforts that have set ambitious goals to end preventable maternal and newborn deaths, increase access to voluntary family planning, and accelerate improvements in malaria, nutrition, and water and sanitation.  These renewed efforts have spurred strategic shifts in maternal and child health programming including:  increasing efforts in those countries with the largest share of under-five deaths, focusing on reaching the most underserved populations, targeting the drivers of mortality through innovation and scalable interventions, and creating mutual accountability at all levels.
The Ebola outbreak in West Africa is a jarring reminder of the need for a greater capability in all countries to rapidly detect and respond to new or re-emerging public health threats that “spill over” in humans from animal populations.  The Global Health Security agenda is an effort between the U.S. government, other nations, international organizations and public and private stakeholders, to accelerate progress toward a world safe and secure from infectious disease threats and to promote global health security as an international security priority.  The State Department, along with other U.S. government agencies, contributes to global health security by strengthening policies related to dual-use research of concern.
The U.S. government will use its influence in multilateral and bilateral arenas to focus attention on accelerating achievement of U.S. global health objectives and the UN Millennium Development Goals. Continued diplomatic leadership on global health in the UN Post-2015 Development Agenda will remain a U.S. priority.  Supported by the State Department and USAID, our diplomats and development professionals will promote country-owned health systems and encourage shared responsibility for financing health systems with partner governments, other donors, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector.  Although U.S. positions on health in the Post-2015 Development Agenda have yet to be finalized, they will likely include a focus on creating an AIDS-free generation and ending preventable child and maternal deaths.  The U.S. government is also considering incorporating new areas such as non-communicable diseases and a multi-sectoral focus on health system strengthening in the Post-2015 development goals.
Many external factors affect U.S. government efforts on country ownership and shared responsibility.  A successful transition to country ownership depends on political stewardship by partner governments and the administrative and technical capabilities of numerous public and private institutions.  Fiscal pressures on traditional donor countries will likely continue to negatively affect their ability to support multilateral initiatives. Steady economic growth in many regions, and particularly in Africa, will create opportunities for countries to direct more domestic resources toward their health sectors.
The U.S. government, through the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005 and newly-signed Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2014, is committed to using its foreign assistance resources to help people and countries have reliable and sustainable access to an acceptable quantity and quality of water to meet their needs.  USAID supports increased access to reliable and sustainable water supply and sanitation through funding for infrastructure development and through institutional and capacity development, strengthening of community-based systems, facilitation of private supply of products and services, improved management and governance, and mobilization of additional financing.
