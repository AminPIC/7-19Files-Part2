</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Smoking and second hand smoke is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States, killing more than an estimated 480,000 people in the U.S. each year.&amp;nbsp; For every smoker who dies from a smoking-attributable disease, another 30 live with a serious smoking-related disease. &amp;nbsp;Smoking costs the U.S. more than $300 billion a year, including nearly $170 billion in direct medical costs, and more than $156 billion in lost productivity. &amp;nbsp;An estimated 58 million nonsmoking Americans are exposed to secondhand smoke, which causes more than 41,000 deaths in non-smoking adults each year[1].&amp;nbsp; While cigarette smoking among adults has declined significantly over the past several decades, the use of other tobacco products has increased or stayed the same in recent years, concurrent with reductions in state investments in tobacco control program.&amp;nbsp; Fortunately, people who stop smoking greatly reduce their risk for disease and premature death. Smoking cessation lowers the risk for lung and other types of cancer; it reduces the risk for coronary heart disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease.&amp;nbsp; .&amp;nbsp;

For FY15, the annual per capita adult cigarette consumption fell to 1,211 cigarette equivalents a 4% reduction from FY 14, but missing the target of 1,174 (37 cigarette equivalents).&amp;nbsp; However, the FY14 results (the most recent available data) of other combustible tobacco use indicators are tracking lower usage across both adults and youth:


	Percentage of adult smokers&amp;nbsp; - 16.8%; exceeding the FY14 target of 18% (National Health Interview Survey)
	Percentage of adult smokers last smoked 6 months to 1 year ago – 7.6%; exceeding the FY14 target of 7.2% (National Health Interview Survey)
	Percentage of children/adolescents initiation – 3.8%; exceeding the FY14 target of 4.7% (National Survey on Drug Use and Health)
	Percentage of young adults initiation – 7.2%; exceeding the FY14 target of 7.5% (National Survey on Drug Use and Health)


These significant trends with the continued plans of the Department to address combustible tobacco use make the FY16-FY17 combustible tobacco Agency Priority Goal highly achievable.&amp;nbsp;

In 2010, HHS issued Ending the Epidemic – A Tobacco Control Strategic Action Plan, outlining a set of comprehensive actions framed around four key Healthy People 2020 tobacco control objectives:


	reduce tobacco use
	reduce the initiation of tobacco use
	increase successful cessation attempts by smokers
	reduce the proportion of nonsmokers exposed to secondhand smoke.


The National Prevention Strategy, released in 2011, includes tobacco control as one of seven priorities across the U.S. Government.

In 2013, cigarette and smokeless tobacco companies spent more than $9.5 billion, more than $1 million per hour that year, on advertising and promotional expenses in the United States to attract new users, retain current users, increase consumption, and generate favorable attitudes toward smoking.&amp;nbsp; There is also a growing concern regarding new tobacco products that are being marketed to smokers as alternatives for use in smoke-free environments. &amp;nbsp;Dual use of cigarettes and other tobacco products can maintain tobacco addiction and use among smokers who might otherwise quit. &amp;nbsp;The marketing of purported reduced-risk products may increase overall tobacco use. Consumer mistaken perceptions of the “safety” of these products may pose a continuing obstacle for tobacco control.

States continue to reduce funding for comprehensive tobacco control. Research has shown that progress to prevent initiation and promote cessation in comprehensive programs is reversed when funding is no longer sustained.&amp;nbsp;

HHS engages with multiple stakeholders in implementing tobacco control activities, which include: Congress, the public, minority communities, groups affected by tobacco-related health disparities, state and local tobacco control officials, tobacco control and public health non-governmental organizations, the scientific &amp;amp; research community, and businesses.

The U.S. Congress has provided direction and support for tobacco control activities in the following legislative actions:


	The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
	The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA)
	The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (FSPTCA)
	The Children’s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA)


HHS oversees tobacco control and prevention committees covered by the Federal Advisory Committee Act. All meetings of these committees are open to the public and offer opportunities for stakeholder feedback.

</progress_update><themes><theme>Health</theme></themes><contributing_programs_and_other_factors>The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, HHS (OASH) OASH coordinates all tobacco control activities for the Department and has lead responsibility for accomplishment of this goal. The Assistant Secretary for Health directed the development of the HHS Strategic Plan on Tobacco Control. The Surgeon General chairs the HHS Tobacco Control Implementation Committee, and is the APG Goal Leader.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) CDC’s Center for Chronic Disease and Public Health Promotion, through the Office on Smoking and Health, provides national leadership for a comprehensive, broad-based approach to reducing tobacco use. Essential elements of this approach include state-based, community-based, and health system-based interventions; cessation services; counter-marketing; policy development and implementation; tobacco product research; surveillance; and evaluation.

The Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Tobacco Products (CTP)&amp;nbsp; FDA is responsible for implementing the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control Act), which gives the agency authority to regulate the manufacture, marketing, and distribution of tobacco products as provided by statute and as appropriate for the protection of public health. Some of the agency’s responsibilities under the law include setting tobacco product standards, reviewing premarket applications for new and modified-risk tobacco products, requiring new health warnings, and estab­lishing and enforcing advertising and promotion restrictions.

The National Institute of Health’s Tobacco Control Research Branch (TCRB) NIH has identified research to prevent and control tobacco use and tobacco-related cancers as a public health priority. The Tobacco Control Research Branch (TCRB) in the National Cancer Institute leads and collaborates on research and disseminates evidence-based findings to prevent, treat, and control tobacco use. Branch activities include funding research grants and contracts, sponsoring conferences and symposia, and disseminating tobacco control science. Additionally, experts conduct research and partici­pate in diverse scientific and programmatic activities in support of national and international tobacco control efforts.&amp;nbsp; TCRB smoking cessation and mobile health experts also lead the Smokefree.gov Initiative (SFGI). SFGI provides interventions for smoking and related health behaviors across web, text, smartphone app and social media platforms.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) CMS provides coverage of smoking and tobacco cessation counseling for certain beneficiaries. Through Medicare, all beneficiaries who use tobacco are covered.&amp;nbsp; Tobacco cessation counseling and likewise the provision of tobacco cessation pharmaceuticals are optional benefits under Medicaid for all individuals should the state elect to provide them. As of 10/1/10, Medicaid requires states to provide those services to pregnant women.

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) SAMHSA supports a variety of tobacco prevention and treatment activities. &amp;nbsp;This includes collaborating with states and behavioral health providers to address the high prevalence of tobacco use by persons with mental and substance use disorders. &amp;nbsp;In addition, SAMHSA is responsible for implementing the Synar Amendment, which requires states to have laws prohibiting the sale and distribution of tobacco products to minors, enforce those laws, and report on retail non-compliance.&amp;nbsp;

The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) HRSA’s Health Center Program addresses tobacco use through education, counseling and treatment, aligning with the Healthy People 2020 framework for ending the tobacco use epidemic by supporting tobacco use prevention efforts and helping tobacco users quit.&amp;nbsp; The Health Center Program monitors these efforts by tracking the percentage of patients who are screened for tobacco use and provided appropriate cessation counseling or medication if needed.&amp;nbsp;

The Indian Health Service (IHS) The IHS Cancer Program seeks to reduce tobacco use by promoting clinic based cessation efforts, encouraging community-based education and policy interventions, and providing technical assistance to existing surveillance efforts for Indian Health Service, Tribal health, and urban Indian health programs.
