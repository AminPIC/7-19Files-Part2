1) My supervisor provides me with constructive suggestions to improve my job performance.

2) In my work unit, steps are taken to deal with a poor performer who cannot or will not improve.

3) Employees have a feeling of personal empowerment with respect to work processes.

4) I feel encouraged to come up with new and better ways of doing things.

5) How satisfied are you with the information you receive from management on what's going on&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; in your organization?

6) My organization's leaders maintain high standards of honesty and integrity.
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Leader and managerial actions can help boost job satisfaction and ultimately improve business outcomes.&amp;nbsp; Strong leaders are important to creating a positive organizational climate.&amp;nbsp; Employees who are regularly engaged with their leaders are more innovative than others, more likely to want to remain with their employer, absent less often, enjoy greater levels of personal well-being, and perceive their workload to be more sustainable than others.&amp;nbsp; Ultimately, our customer, the Veteran, will enjoy a higher level of satisfaction with VA services as a result of an improved Employee Experience.

VA is committed to creating a work environment which provides all employees with a more consistent, positive Employee Experience, which ultimately improves the Veteran’s experience with our organization.&amp;nbsp; Studies indicate that employees who are satisfied with leadership behaviors provide a higher level of positive responses on employee surveys.

To evaluate progress, VA will use six questions from the Federal Employment Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) to pulse VA employees on a quarterly basis about their experience with VA leaders. &amp;nbsp;The six questions were selected after a thorough review and assessment of what leadership behaviors can drive the biggest improvements in employee engagement and job satisfaction.

Transformational leaders engage in relationship-building and relationship maintaining behaviors with their employees.&amp;nbsp; Strong leaders tend to have the ability to motivate employees, establish trust, communicate goals, and generate commitment.&amp;nbsp; Changing an organization’s culture may take a decade or longer, especially with a large organization such as VA.&amp;nbsp; This APG, which covers only a two-year time period, focuses on a strategy that primarily addresses improving leadership practices, and that can bring about measurable changes in a relatively short period of time.

The leadership strategy in this APG is supported by myriad programs and activities including strategic communications which, over time, should lead to improved favorable responses to the six employee survey questions. The leadership strategy also supports the accomplishment of one of VA’s Strategic Objectives, “Make VA a Place People Want to Serve,” and VA’s MyVA Initiative.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, it is one of the twelve VA “Breakthrough Priorities.”

VA realizes that it will take more than one program or initiative to improve the Employee Experience and/or change VA employees’ perceptions of its leaders.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, analyzing employee survey results carries its own set of risks of misinterpretation.&amp;nbsp; However, overall, VA believes that participation in leadership programs and the subsequent implementation of leadership practices should have a significant positive impact on employee perceptions of leadership.

Potential barriers to improving the VA Employee Experience include:


	Lack of leader/employee engagement to execute improvement ideas
	Resistance to change
	Inadequate leader development, training and experience
	Insufficient execution of communication strategies by leadership

&amp;nbsp;
</next_steps><progress_update>Each of VA’s five indicators for improving the employee experience showed significant increases in Q4 and exceeded the goal.

LEADERS DEVELOPING LEADERS (LDL):
In August 2015, VA Senior Leaders set out to develop the framework to improve training and leadership at VA, and to define a clear point of view regarding VA’s strategy, implementation of its values, and the desired culture that would be used to teach other staff and guide decision-making.&amp;nbsp; The Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Under Secretaries and Assistant Secretaries, and members of the MyVA team developed a framework called “Leaders Developing Leaders (LDL),” which includes cascading training throughout VA on developing leadership judgement, analyzing the enterprise, teambuilding and team feedback, managing change, and directly applying these skills to address current challenges.&amp;nbsp; The FY 2016 goal to train 12,000 VA employees was surpassed in Q3 due to momentum achieved in the cascading of training from front line supervisors to their employees.&amp;nbsp;


In Q4 FY 2016:
•&amp;nbsp;VA conducted the Senior Leader Annual Business Meeting September 12-15, 2016 in Leesburg, VA for over 600 VA senior leaders.&amp;nbsp; Senior VA Leaders approved the FY 2017 vision, priorities, and strategies at this event and provided direction for development of training materials to cascade information to all VA employees.
•&amp;nbsp;As of September 20, 2016, over 99,049 unique LDL completions have been recorded in TMS.&amp;nbsp;

LEADERSHIP VA (LVA):
LVA is VA’s flagship leadership development program for GS 13-15 employees - creating opportunities to ensure continuity of leadership by strengthening employees’ fundamental competencies in the areas of external awareness, vision, entrepreneurship, accountability, conflict management, continued learning, and creativity and innovation.&amp;nbsp; LVA also focuses on customer service to better serve our Veterans.&amp;nbsp; The LVA program is assisting in identifying and addressing potential gaps in effective leadership and to design and maintain programs that capture organizational knowledge and promote learning.&amp;nbsp; The LVA Class of 2016 consists of 100 VA employees.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;


In Q4 FY 2016:
• VA successfully conducted the third one-week residency session for LVA from August 22 – 26, 2016 in Saint Paul, MN.&amp;nbsp;
•&amp;nbsp; We currently have 12 executive sponsors supporting the 12 Breakthrough Initiatives for our LVA Project Teams.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Sponsors provide mentoring and coaching assistance for each of the initiative LVA project teams.&amp;nbsp; Teams will report out the results of actionable deliverables during the LVA Project Team InnoVAtion Symposium scheduled for November 14 – 18, 2016 in Washington, DC.&amp;nbsp;
•&amp;nbsp;In Q4, the application process was completed for the FY 2017 cohort.

CORPORATE EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT BOARD (CEDB):&amp;nbsp;
CEDB is one of VA’s leadership development initiatives for high-potential, high-performing GS 13-15 and Title 38 equivalent employees.&amp;nbsp; The objective of the CEDB process is to identify and nominate the best qualified employees to attend high-impact training and professional development programs/opportunities.&amp;nbsp; CEDB programs are conducted by established and widely recognized leadership development institutions focused on driving innovation and strategic planning.&amp;nbsp; Participation in these leadership programs requires a commitment—and opportunity—to drive VA's organizational change to better meet the needs of Veterans and their families.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;


In Q4 FY 2016:
•&amp;nbsp;The FY15 Cohort of 96 VA employees graduated from the Partnership for Public Service “Excellence in Government Program” on August 18, 2016.&amp;nbsp; VA Secretary Robert McDonald was the keynote speaker for the graduation ceremony.&amp;nbsp;
•&amp;nbsp;14 VA employees graduated from the Graduate School USA’s “Executive Potential Program” on August 26, 2016.
•&amp;nbsp;One VA employee was selected for the highly competitive White House Leadership Development Program (WHLDP) which will last from 1 October 2016 to 30 September 2017.
&amp;nbsp;
SENIOR EXECUTIVE WORKSHOP SERIES (SEWS):
SEWS provides developmental training for VA Senior Executives to address emerging senior executive skill and information requirements.&amp;nbsp; The program provides information on current topics, including updates on the Secretary’s priority transformation initiatives and activities associated with MyVA, working effectively and proactively with Congress, enhancing employee engagement, work place balance/well-being issues, emotional intelligence, and effectively dealing with unions and labor management issues.
&amp;nbsp;
In Q4 FY 2016:&amp;nbsp;

•&amp;nbsp;SEWS sessions fully integrated VA’s state-of-the-art video and social media capabilities.&amp;nbsp; During this quarter, all SEWS&amp;nbsp; presenters were able to deliver their session in “real time”, allowing asynchronous learning as executives provided written comments, questions and experiences that are shared during the presentation with executives across the enterprise.&amp;nbsp; The use of both professional moderators and CSEMO Subject Matter Experts provided excellent field integration and opportunities for robust dialogue and for immediate feedback to all participants.&amp;nbsp; All SEWS presentations are posted to the VA Pulse / SEWS website, enabling executives who missed the workshops the opportunity to view past presentations and for new executives to review past presentations and accelerate their understanding of VA and its mission.&amp;nbsp;

•&amp;nbsp;The CSEMO Staff hosted SEWS sessions that focused upon preparing senior leaders for end of year performance appraisals and informing them of:
o&amp;nbsp;Significant changes in executive compensation,
o&amp;nbsp;New guidelines for the Senior Executive Alternative Work Schedule (AWS) policy
o&amp;nbsp;Pay band alignment
o&amp;nbsp;Time-to-Hire data
o&amp;nbsp;The Executive Order related to &quot;Strengthening the SES&quot;

STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP COURSES I &amp;amp; II (SLC):
SLC I &amp;amp; II courses are designed by the Corporate Senior Executive Management Office (CSEMO) to equip newly appointed and new to VA senior executives with the tools necessary to rapidly transition into their role as VA strategic leaders and to excel in that role.&amp;nbsp; SLC I provides critical information and insight into VA’s organizational culture and structure.&amp;nbsp; It provides insights into the organizational environment and the executive skills needed to transform a work unit.&amp;nbsp; SLC II is designed to support the VA strategic goal of improving business operations and to support VA’s transformation strategy.&amp;nbsp; The course focuses on honing and developing strategic decision-making, critical thinking, and leading change skills.

Iterations of both SLC I &amp;amp; II were conducted during this quarter.&amp;nbsp; The efforts to enhance course content and materials resulted in:

o&amp;nbsp;Better integration with the Secretary’s “12 Breakthrough Priorities” and&amp;nbsp; increased time for participant interaction;
o&amp;nbsp; Emphasized connection between the actions of senior leaders and employee engagement and organizational success
o&amp;nbsp; Taught strategies for improving business processes, leading change, and incorporating best practices in communication.

Participants in both SLC I and SLC II are provided end of course critiques to allow feedback. Overall, executives are pleased with the information conveyed and relevance to their assigned duties.&amp;nbsp; They confirm the usefulness to the enhancements cited above. Specifically, the SLC I focus on developing a realistic “leadership philosophy” and the SLC II focus on effective ways to implement change continue to be rated very favorably .

STRENGTHENING THE SENIOR EXECUTIVE SERVICE:
On December 15, 2015, the President issued an Executive Order (EO) entitled Strengthening the Senior Executive Service (SES), which outlined a plan to enhance the recruitment, hiring, and development of senior executives in Federal government.&amp;nbsp; In response to this order, OPM tasked Federal agencies with developing a 2-year plan to increase the number of SES members who are rotating to improve talent development, mission delivery, and collaboration.&amp;nbsp; Agencies were to submit plans to OPM by May 31, 2016.&amp;nbsp; VA submitted its plan to OPM as directed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The plan outlines a process to identify ways to document and track executive job rotations.&amp;nbsp; This work is ongoing and remains a strategic communication priority to build senior executive understanding and leadership support of meaningful and useful rotations during FY 17.

In Q4 FY 2016:

Executive Development Plans (EDPs):
•&amp;nbsp;In support of the December 15, 2015, Executive Order, CSEMO designed and communicated a process for distributing and collecting Executive Development Planning templates from all senior executives.&amp;nbsp; EDPs when completed are now forwarded to CSEMO for storage.&amp;nbsp; Reminder messages are sent to encourage completion of EDP’s.

EXECUTIVE COACHING:
CSEMO provides all newly-appointed SES and SES-equivalent leaders with the opportunity to engage an International Coaching Federation Certified executive coach, to assist in their transition to their new roles as senior organizational leaders.&amp;nbsp; Each executive is allotted up to 36 hours of coaching.&amp;nbsp; Although each coaching engagement is targeted to the unique needs and challenges of the executive, most coaching sessions focus upon VA’s leadership competencies such as:&amp;nbsp; Fostering Accountability; Managing Conflict; Enhancing Creativity and Innovation; Excelling at Customer Service; Demonstrating Decisiveness; Developing Others; Influencing Outcomes; and Developing Partnerships.&amp;nbsp;

In Q4 FY 2016:

All newly hired, or newly appointed senior executives were made aware of the opportunity to engage a nationally certified executive coach.&amp;nbsp;

Post coaching evaluations indicated:

•&amp;nbsp; Sep 21, 2016 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Virtual Session 2: How to Make the Most of Virtual Meetings

VIRTUAL ASPIRING LEADERS PROGRAM (vALP):&amp;nbsp;
vALP expands the leadership skillset of emerging leaders, consistent with the VA competencies and expand the capabilities of existing VALU leadership development tools in order to provide robust online learning opportunities and reach a wide cross-section of interested VA employees.&amp;nbsp; vALP Creates opportunities to ensure champions of change through Creativity and Innovation.&amp;nbsp; vALP graduates serve as champions for new ideas and approaches and articulate linkage between new behaviors and organizational success.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In FY16, almost 2,400 VA employees applied for this program.&amp;nbsp; Based on fiscal constraints, two cohorts, 100 students each (200 total), were conducted in FY 16.&amp;nbsp;

In Q4 FY 2016:
•&amp;nbsp;Virtual classes continued
•&amp;nbsp;180-Degree Assessments were completed 11-29 July

360 AND 180 ASSESSMENTS:&amp;nbsp;
VA uses the 360/180 tools for individual assessment and development of leadership skills.&amp;nbsp; Participation is voluntary with 360/180 assessments administered monthly, largely to staff through VA’s leadership development programs and annually to all VA SES.&amp;nbsp;
In Q4 FY 2016 :&amp;nbsp;

•&amp;nbsp;In 2016, VA continued an upward trend in the voluntary participation of senior leaders in 360/180 assessments surpassing the FY 2015 usage rates by 44%.&amp;nbsp; VA continues to encourage the use of assessments to develop leaders throughout VA.

Total number of participants at the end of FY 2015:
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 2,497
Total Number of participants at the end of FY 2016:
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 3,597

INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT PLANS (IDPs) AND ELECTRONIC INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT PLANS (eIDPs):
One of the key activities in support of the VA Agency Priority Goal to Improve Employee Engagement is increased implementation of IDPs and use of new eIDPs.&amp;nbsp; The delivery of the eIDP to employees at the front line encourages and supports discussions about job performance, as well as career and skill development, which ultimately leads to a more engaged, capable, and satisfied workforce.&amp;nbsp; The eIDP is a supporting software tool that automates and tracks the process in the VA Talent Management System (TMS).&amp;nbsp;
To date, the initial test implementation phases provided eIDPs to over 5,300 VA employees in VA Learning University (VALU) and the VA HR Academy. Feedback from this first phase of implementation was incorporated into the eIDP process and supporting TMS functionality. For FY 2016, 100% of VALU employees have supervisor-approved plans in TMS followed by approximately 65% of the HR professionals.&amp;nbsp; During a second phase, 315 employees and supervisors were trained in the use of the eIDP.&amp;nbsp; Of those trained there are 131 eIDPs in development.&amp;nbsp; The team gathered participant feedback to inform the Department-wide release.

In Q4 FY 2016:&amp;nbsp;

•&amp;nbsp;Building on the results of the earlier implementation phases, the team is completing work on the project and communications plans for the Department-wide release for Q1 FY 2017. The TMS upgrades are on schedule for release between 10/21-10/23. The TMS Training Manager is working to develop the eIDP web-based training course for employees and supervisors.

NEW SUPERVISORS ESSENTIALS (NSE):
New Supervisors Essentials (NSE) is a newly-created course that enables growth within fundamental competencies focusing on
areas of Continued Learning, Integrity, Honesty, Interpersonal Skills, Oral Communication, Public Service Motivation, and Written Communication.&amp;nbsp; The course was successfully tested for compatibility with TMS and VA Pulse.&amp;nbsp; VA supervisors are now able to sign up for the course in VA’s online TMS.&amp;nbsp; The course meets the standards established by OPM for the Federal Government.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Administrations, staff offices, and local facilities may supplement that training as they deem appropriate, but NSE is the baseline standard for all.&amp;nbsp; The goal is to reach up to 3,000 new supervisors per year beginning in FY 2017.

In Q4 FY 2016:

•&amp;nbsp;As of 15 September 2016, 2,808 supervisors had enrolled in the course and 467 had completed the training.&amp;nbsp;

EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT RESOURCE CENTER:
Since it was established in May 2015, the Employee Engagement Service (EES) enhanced its website home page capability by adding an engagement resource center that serves as a “one-stop shop” repository of additional hosted site links for:&amp;nbsp; employee engagement awareness; engagement spotlight and announcements; direct access to VA Workforce Surveys Portal; searchable database of current research/trends in engagement; and associated best practices.

Expected Outcomes Include:

•&amp;nbsp;Strengthened communication about&amp;nbsp; employee engagement and how VA measures engagement
•&amp;nbsp;Increased knowledge of&amp;nbsp; VA’s engagement partners and where to go for further employee engagement resources
•&amp;nbsp;Increased utilization of the platform to share ideas and practices to improve engagement

In Q4 FY 2016&amp;nbsp; EES&amp;nbsp; tracked&amp;nbsp; the following indicators to better assess site utilization/areas for improvement:
&amp;nbsp;Webpage views:&amp;nbsp; “The number of times a page was visited…”
o&amp;nbsp;EERC page views decreased 55 percent in Q4 compared to Q3.
o&amp;nbsp;The EERC site was viewed 13,563 times in Q4, down from 30,229 views in Q3.
o&amp;nbsp;There were 10,147 unique page views to the EERC, down from 25,175 in Q3.
EERC page views in Q4 accounted for 3.4% of all OHRM page views (30,229 out of 397,851), down from 7.5% in Q3. (Note: The EERC site for Q4 moved from OHRM to an ODI URL during the end of the quarter, so this may have impacted the numbers slightly.)
o&amp;nbsp; The decrease in page views is likely due to an absence of senior-leader products for large campaigns linking to the EERC this quarter (in Q3, nearly half of all page views were attributed to Sec VA products linking to the EERC for PSRW)
Average Time on Page: “The average amount of time visitors spent on this page”
o&amp;nbsp;Visitors spent an average of 53 seconds on EERC pages in Q4, up from 38 seconds in Q3.
o&amp;nbsp;Time spent on pages increased, indicating increased interest in EERC content.
Bounce rate:&amp;nbsp; “Percentage of visits that started on a webpage and then left the website straightaway…”
o&amp;nbsp;40 percent in Q4, down from 70 percent in Q3.
o&amp;nbsp;The bounce rate decrease indicates increased interest in EERC content: as more people visited multiple pages on the EERC, rather than just visiting on page and then leaving.
Exit rate: “The percentage of visits that left the website after a viewing this page…”
o&amp;nbsp;The exit rate was 34 percent in Q4, down from 66 percent in Q3.
o&amp;nbsp;By itself this statistic is not very telling; it does not indicate how many pages the visitor may have viewed before this page or how long they spent on the page.
Downloads:&amp;nbsp; “Total number of clicks on download links …”
o&amp;nbsp;There were 510 product downloads in Q4, down from 702 in Q3.
o&amp;nbsp;The most downloaded content came from the Employee Engagement Handbook and Playbook.
Overall Observations:
o&amp;nbsp;Page views decreased substantially in Q4, most likely due to an absence of senior leader products sent during large campaigns advertising the EERC (compared to Q3, when Sec VA products for PSRW generated a large amount of page views).&amp;nbsp;
o&amp;nbsp;While page views decreased- indicating less awareness of the site- the time spent on pages increased and the bounce rate decreased-indicating more interest in EERC content.

EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT COUNCIL:

In Q4 FY 2016:&amp;nbsp;

•&amp;nbsp;VA’s Employment Engagement Council continues to address engagement issues impacting VA’s workforce.&amp;nbsp; This quarter, through Council members’ collaboration, HR&amp;amp;A established the Employee Engagement Champions in July to connect each site to HR&amp;amp;A and to each other to help enhance employee engagement efforts.&amp;nbsp; Engagement Champions serve as a conduit for each site’s best practices through the HR&amp;amp;A Leading Practices site, enabling each site to benefit from how others have successfully improved employee engagement.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, as more Engagement Champions utilize HR&amp;amp;A tools, HR&amp;amp;A will gather feedback to continuously improve employee engagement efforts as a whole.&amp;nbsp; HR&amp;amp;A provided training, tools, and resources to support the Engagement Champions in creating a local engagement action plans based on 2016 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey results.&amp;nbsp; Engagement action plans are due 31 October and will be posted on the VA Workforce Surveys Portal.

•&amp;nbsp;The Q4 Pulse Survey results reported in the final section of this report reflect a truer picture of how VA employees perceive their work experiences since the data were collected using a census methodology and had a high response rate.&amp;nbsp; The patterns across all of the data (Q4, Q1-Q3) are similar, indicating that the “best” experiences are Constructive Performance Feedback, Innovation, and Senior Leaders Ethics; while “lesser” experiences are Accountability, Empowerment, and Information Sharing.&amp;nbsp; Q4 results also report that the target value was exceeded for all measures.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (VHA):

LEADERSHIP, EFFECTIVENESS, ACCOUNTABILITY AND DEVELOPMENT (LEAD) PROGRAMS:
The first level of actual “leadership” development for VHA employees occurs through VHA LEAD training programs.&amp;nbsp; LEAD programs are offered at two different levels.&amp;nbsp; Facility LEAD programs target junior grade employees, are organized and conducted locally within each medical center, and introduce participants to healthcare leadership and teamwork concepts through classroom instruction and practical exercises.&amp;nbsp; Each Veteran Integrated Service Network (VISN) conducts its own VISN LEAD program for mid-grade employees.&amp;nbsp; The curriculum builds on Facility LEAD training and includes individual assessments, mentoring and applied leadership projects. Organization of the classes and selection of participants occurs at the local level.&amp;nbsp; Approximately 1,200 VHA employees complete a Facility or VISN LEAD program each year.&amp;nbsp;

In Q4 FY 2016:&amp;nbsp;

•&amp;nbsp;Field-managed VISN and Facility LEAD Class continue through October 1, 2016.&amp;nbsp; Currently there are 12 VISN-level programs with 281 active candidates and 85 Facility-level programs with 675 active candidates.

HEALTH CARE LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (HCLDP):
HCLDP is a comprehensive, graduate-level leadership program established in FY 2012 for aspiring health care leaders who have not yet assumed an executive position (i.e., they are not a member of the facility senior leadership team [quad] nor in a comparable program office role).&amp;nbsp; The curriculum is focused on building the leadership competencies needed in a health care environment as opposed to the technical skills needed in health care executive positions.&amp;nbsp; HCLDP is designed around three face-to-face weeks of training spread over six months with coaching, self-study, and on-the-job “practice” in between.&amp;nbsp; Multiple leadership profile assessments, guided discussions presentations, and practical exercises, including hands-on simulations based on real-world medical center leadership situations, enable the participants to expand their individual, team and organizational health care leadership skills.&amp;nbsp; Selection of HCLDP participants includes an individual multi-question application, several levels of endorsement, telephone PBI interview, and scoring by an executive national rating panel.&amp;nbsp; One hundred and twenty participants (two classes of 60) are currently going through the FY 2016 HCLDP program.

In Q4 FY 2016:&amp;nbsp;

•&amp;nbsp;The HCLDP 2017 selection process continues.&amp;nbsp; The VISNs are completing their performance-based interviews and VISN Directors are submitting their Level 3 Endorsements.&amp;nbsp; As soon as the final endorsements are complete, the National Rating Panel will meet virtually through the month of October to score the applications.&amp;nbsp; The HCLDP Advisory board will review the list of selectees in early November; the program manager will notify the VISN Directors of the status of their VISN’s applicants and the applicants themselves by November 15.&amp;nbsp;
•&amp;nbsp;The HCLDP 2016a and HCLDP 2016b classes successfully completed their third and final week of training in July and August respectively.&amp;nbsp; HCLDP 2016a completed their final face-to-face training week in Q4 with 56 participants and HCLDP 2016b completed in August with 55 participants.&amp;nbsp;

EXECUTIVE CANDIDATE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (ECDP):
The ECDP is currently under development as a means to broaden and strengthen the candidate pool supporting medical center senior leadership team positions.&amp;nbsp; It is being designed for high-potential employees whose next career step is to join a quad leadership team (i.e., Assistant/Associate Director (AD), Chief of Staff (COS), or Associate Director for Patient Care Services/Nurse Executive (ADPCS) position).&amp;nbsp; The primary focus is on building the technical skills needed to perform successfully in the target health care leadership positions.&amp;nbsp; Individual training portfolios will include specific on-the-job experiences, a 120-day detail into a vacant quad position, and dedicated coaching/mentoring guidance and evaluation.&amp;nbsp; The foundational leadership competencies, grown through the HCLDP and other programs, will be reinforced through individual assessments and group sessions.&amp;nbsp; Finalization of the program training portfolio and selection for a pilot class of 15-20 candidates to begin in late FY 2016 is currently underway.

In Q4 FY 2016:
&amp;nbsp;
•&amp;nbsp;An online application system was created and applications distributed to 52 potential candidates; 26 candidates applied.&amp;nbsp; The rating process will be used to select approximately 20 candidates.&amp;nbsp; Mentor applications were also distributed.&amp;nbsp; The pilot class will be selected during an advisory board meeting scheduled in October.&amp;nbsp;

NEW EXECUTIVE TRAINING PROGRAM (NExT):
NExT is a required “survival skills” course for all newly-appointed VHA medical center quad members below SES.&amp;nbsp; A week-long, face-to-face orientation session provides attendees with the essential technical content and networking forum to support their success in their new healthcare leadership roles.&amp;nbsp; Senior VA officials, such as the Deputy Secretary and Under Secretary for Health, share their views of the major strategic issues confronting VHA and health care leaders in the field.&amp;nbsp; Plenary and role-specific breakout sessions, led by VA Central Office program office staff and subject matter experts, address topics as varied as ethical leadership dilemmas encountered in health care settings, medical facility operations, clinical performance measures, funds management, human resources, and labor relations.&amp;nbsp; Two NExT classes of 25-35 new quad members are held each year.

In Q4 FY 2016:

•&amp;nbsp;4th Quarter scheduled NExT training was postponed until FY17 due to scheduling conflict with the Secretary’s LDL mandatory Senior Leader training.&amp;nbsp;

VHA SES COACHING NETWORK:
VHA provides its newly-appointed SES and SES equivalent leaders with advanced executive development to assist in their transition to their new roles as leaders of healthcare organizations.&amp;nbsp; The SES Coaching Network leverages experienced VHA executives as facilitators for two face-to-face sessions with the new VHA SES.&amp;nbsp; One session covers conducting crucial conversations with healthcare professionals and the second regards executive decision making in the healthcare environment.&amp;nbsp; Additional topics relevant to healthcare leadership are incorporated in the discussions.&amp;nbsp; The executive training is rounded out through a series of webinars facilitated by VHA subject matter experts and covering both broad topics, like building effective relationships, and health care-specific technical issues, such as medical center performance metrics.&amp;nbsp; This attention on further developing VHA’s health care executives is an essential supplement to the training and executive coaching services offered by the Department for new SES members.&amp;nbsp;

In Q4 FY 2016:

VHA MENTOR CERTIFICATION PROGRAM:
The goal of the VHA Mentor Certification Program is to provide structured training that ensures VHA's workforce development programs are equipped with skilled certified mentors, coaches and preceptors.&amp;nbsp; The program is governed by the VHA Mentor Advisory Board.&amp;nbsp; Administratively the program is managed by Healthcare Leadership Talent Institute (HLTI).&amp;nbsp; There are three levels of certification.&amp;nbsp; Each level builds upon the experiential foundation of the prior level.&amp;nbsp; A national VHA database tracks certification progression.&amp;nbsp; Levels of certification are acquired by logging Practical Experience entries onto the VHA Mentor Certification website.&amp;nbsp;

In Q4 FY 2016:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
•&amp;nbsp;Many rural facilities are taking advantage of a field-managed virtual version of the core training.&amp;nbsp; In Q4, an average of 20 new Fellow and 35 Resident Level Mentors achieved certification.&amp;nbsp;
