</next_steps><progress_update>Measure: Number of terrorism disruptions

The Department of Justice made significant achievements in its National Security Priority Goal for FY 2016. The Department surpassed its FY 2016 target for its number of terrorism disruption performance measure, and also leveraged current and new technology to effectively share intelligence with the U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) and Law Enforcement (LE). This effort is quantified by the number of Guardian and eGuardian incidents shared between the FBI, USIC, and LE community partners. The number of terrorism disruptions effected through counterterrorism investigations greatly surpassed its annual target by 130% (460 vs 200). In executing the FBI’s number one priority to protect the U.S. from terrorist attacks, disruptions remain a key statistic that directly speaks to its counterterrorism responsibilities. The FBI is committed to stopping terrorism of any kind at any stage as evidenced by its transformation into a proactive agency. For example, in July 2016, the Department indicted Mahin Khan on Terrorism, Conspiracy to Commit Terrorism, and Conspiracy to Commit Misconduct Involving Weapons after an investigation by the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force. The charges stem from an investigation into Khan’s repeated communication and conspiracy with an individual whom he believed to be a fighter with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Also in FY 2016, an Uzbek national, Fazliddin Kurbanov, was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison for conspiring and attempting to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization and possessing an unregistered destructive device. The case was also investigated by the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force.

Milestones:&amp;nbsp;

Complete at least one iteration (minimum of 45 students in 3 classes) of the Counterterrorism and Operations Course (CTIOPS) suite. This is a Collaborative course consisting of the Joint Terrorism Task Force Operations (JTTF OPS), CTIOPS, and Management of CTIOPS course. Each class is comprised of at least 15 state/local and federal task force officers culled from over hundreds of agencies, 15 stage II CT FBI agents and 15 CT field supervisors from across the field.

- CEPDU has completed 5 out of the 7 targeted classes providing a 71.4% CTIOPS suite completion goal at the end of FY16 Quarter 4. CEPDU completed one of its target two iterations of CTIOPS training for the fourth quarter of FY2016. CEPDU’s annual target was to complete a total of eight iterations of CTIOPS courses in FY2016. However, due to budgetary constraints, CEPDU’s target was reduced to six iterations.
