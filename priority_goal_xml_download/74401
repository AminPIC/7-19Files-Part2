By September 30, 2017, USDA will :

&amp;nbsp;a) increase the percentage of USDA funding in StrikeForce areas by 10 percent from 2010 baseline $4 billion and;&amp;nbsp;

b) leverage $1 billion of outside resources from baseline in high poverty areas over two years.
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Currently, 85 percent of our country’s persistent poverty counties are in rural America.&amp;nbsp; More than one third of rural Americans and one in four rural American children live in poverty.&amp;nbsp; Kids growing up in families earning even twice the poverty threshold are nearly three times as likely as other children to have poor health, are more likely to finish two fewer years of school, and earn half as much money in their adult life.

Growing the economy by investing in rural communities and increasing opportunities for families is critical to our Nation’s future.&amp;nbsp; Capacity building is essential in these persistent poverty rural areas.&amp;nbsp; By doing so, it enables these communities to increase its readiness for access to USDA’s grant and loan programs as well as leveraging other resources to fund and implement projects and strategies that will spur economic growth.&amp;nbsp;

Starting in&amp;nbsp;FY2016, USDA Rural Development will implement Farm Bill’s Section 6025 Strategic Economic Development which enables Business &amp;amp; Industry Guaranteed Loan, Rural Business Development Grant, Community Facilities, and Water and Environmental Programs to set aside up to 10% of its appropriated funds for prioritizing projects that implement multi-jurisdictional community economic development plans.&amp;nbsp; In high poverty areas, community planning is a critical step for identifying needs, opportunities, resources, &amp;amp; strategies, building partnerships, and identifying the right processes, structure, and leadership to execute milestones and achieve economic goals.&amp;nbsp; Through USDA’s Stronger Economies Together (SET) Initiative and other federal planning programs, we are delivering training and technical assistance so high poverty rural communities can start or update their community economic development plans, build their local capacity, and have increased opportunity to access Section 6025 and other federal programs.&amp;nbsp; In FY2015, we have 75 SET Regions who are actively developing or updating their community economic development plans, which we aim to increase to a 100 by September 30, 2017.&amp;nbsp; These SET Regions along with other high poverty rural and tribal communities with multi-jurisdictional plans can compete for Section 6025 and have the opportunity to fund and implement their projects in a way that align and in support of the community or the region’s economic development and poverty reduction priorities.&amp;nbsp; As we lay the framework and build the 6025 program, USDA should be able to report by September 30, 2017 number of SET Regions and multi-jurisdictional plans adopted under SET and number of economic development projects supported, implemented, and funded due to 6025 in high poverty communities.&amp;nbsp;

Moreover, the StrikeForce Initiative for Rural Growth and Opportunity was created in 2010 to address specific challenges associated with rural poverty.&amp;nbsp; Since then, USDA teams have collaborated with more than 1,000 community partners and public entities to bring targeted assistance to rural areas experiencing chronic poverty.&amp;nbsp; These efforts have helped create jobs, build homes, feed kids, assist farmers and conserve natural resources in StrikeForce designated states.&amp;nbsp; By September 30, 2017, USDA will increase the funding in StrikeForce areas by 10 percent from the 2009 baseline&amp;nbsp;of $4 billion and leverage $1 billion of outside resources for investment in high poverty areas.

To complement, USDA has also established Poverty Targeting goals for each of its State Office with an overall FY2015 goal of 22% of Rural Development’s program funding to be invested in high poverty rural areas.&amp;nbsp; This ensured that our Strikeforce and other States with persistent poverty are given reasonable priority and that Rural Development invests available program funding in areas that need it the most.&amp;nbsp; And in many cases, other non-federal dollars must be leveraged to sufficiently fund projects that will help build capacity and spur economic growth.&amp;nbsp; Program leveraging is essential, it ensures partnership building and utilization of other capital so high poverty communities can have adequate assets to fully support the well-being of its community members.

And lastly, USDA in partnership with the White House Rural Council have been taking a comprehensive look at how its policies impact the way rural areas develop and how well those places support the people who live there, in all aspects of their lives – education, health, housing, business, energy, and transportation.&amp;nbsp; This “place-based” approach is an effort to help places work better for people.&amp;nbsp; An effective place-based policy requires comprehensive interagency collaboration and investment that can ensure an increased impact of federal dollars and a greater return on federal investments. By concentrating resources, this approach asserts the primacy of place in moving our nation towards more robust social and economic outcomes.&amp;nbsp; In FY2014, President Obama announced the Promise Zones, a place-based initiative.&amp;nbsp; USDA and HUD jointly support the coordination and implementation of the Promise Zone objectives.&amp;nbsp; As of FY2015, there are 13 Promise Zone designees, of which four are Rural and Tribal.&amp;nbsp; USDA leads the application, review, and implementation support (i.e. planning, training and technical assistance, matching their needs with the appropriate financing tools to fund projects, etc.) for these Rural and Tribal designees.&amp;nbsp; By September 30, 2017, there will be two additional Rural and Tribal designees. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

(Cumulative since 2010):&amp;nbsp;Each agency should attempt to achieve a minimum increase in average StrikeForce designated area applications of:


	FSA - 268 applications each year for a total of approximately 5,914 applications by FY 17
	NRCS - 545 applications each year for a total of approximately 15,394 applications by FY 17
	RD - 1,229 applications each year for a total of approximately 28,422 applications by FY 17


USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA) is committed to providing informational and educational opportunities to all through the Agency’s Outreach and Education Program. One example of this, is the Bridges to Opportunity service FSA is incorporating into every county office in Fiscal Year 2017. Bridges services gives customers access to a wide range of agricultural resources and connects customers with local agricultural partners.
