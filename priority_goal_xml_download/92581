</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>GOAL OVERVIEW

Dramatically boosting completion rates for postsecondary certificates and degrees is essential for the United States to successfully compete in a global economy. The President set a goal in 2009 that, by 2020, the U.S. will have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world. Meeting this goal will require millions of additional Americans to earn a postsecondary degree by the end of this decade—a 50 percent increase in the college attainment rate nationwide. The Department of Education (ED) is implementing new initiatives from the President’s Value and Affordability Agenda to help increase the college attainment rate, and has proposed several new programs which, if enacted and/or funded, will significantly accelerate progress toward the goal.

&amp;nbsp;

Starting from a baseline college degree attainment rate of 44.0 percent in 2012, to reach the President’s goal in 2020, ED set targets projecting the annual increase to grow progressively each year above the four-year historical average of 0.7 percentage points: &amp;nbsp;0.7, 0.9, 1.2, 1.6, 2.1, 2.8, 3.2, and 3.5. This variation in annual increase reflects the fact that, at the time targets were set, we had few programs that directly impacted the attainment rate, and the impact of newly proposed programs would take several years to play out if funded. Since the data for any given year are reported in the following year, the growth will lead to 60% of all Americans having an associate’s degree or higher (as reported in 2021, which will reflect 2020 data; note that certificates are not included since the U.S. currently is not able to measure attainment of certificates in the population).

&amp;nbsp;

To meet annual targets, by September 30, 2016, 46.8% of adults ages 25-34 will have an associate’s degree or higher, which will keep the nation on track to reach the President’s goal of 60% attainment by 2020. The President’s focus on the educational attainment among ages 25-34 allows us to assess progress in preparing the next generation of U.S. workers and to benchmark for international comparisons. Nonetheless, college completion for all ages is important, including unemployed, under-skilled and older workers, veterans and other underrepresented student categories.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

KEY BARRIERS AND CHALLENGES

Success will depend in large part on the extent to which states reinvest in higher education and on whether both states and institutions (a) implement policies and programs to increase college access and success, (b) reduce costs and time to completion, (c) support accelerated learning opportunities, including dual enrollment, (d) develop and adopt effective and innovative practices and reforms that improve student outcomes, and (e) promote seamless transitions from secondary to postsecondary education and among higher education institutions. Despite two years of per-student funding increases nationally, state higher educational appropriations per student are still below 2008 pre-recession levels (down by 15.3 percent as of 2015). Although forty states increased their funding in 2015 over prior-year funding, few are even meeting the levels they funded at the start of the recession; 45 states invested less per student in 2015 than they did in 2008.[1] ED will use its available resources and programs, administrative action, bully pulpit, technical assistance, and ability to convene stakeholders to drive collaboration and best practices, but has limited leverage to influence state policies and institutional practices without new programs that are specifically structured toward this goal, such as the proposed America’s College Promise and College Opportunity and Graduation Bonus programs.

&amp;nbsp;

College enrollment rates typically decrease during times of improving economic conditions, as is currently occurring. While increases in high school graduation rates (one of the factors that feed into the attainment rate) are growing, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that fewer high school graduates are opting for college than they were in 2009—65.9 percent in 2013, 68.4 percent in 2014, and 69.2 percent in 2015, compared with a high point of 70.1 percent in 2009.[2] Total fall enrollment has declined as well, falling by an estimated 3.6 percent in 2015 from an enrollment surge in 2010.[3] This could make it more challenging to achieve the accelerated growth in the college attainment rate that is projected in the annual targets, unless there is a significant increase in the percentage of students who complete their programs of study. In fact, after two years of achieving attainment rate targets, ED missed the 2016 target by 0.3 percentage points—a small amount, but one that hints of the challenge going forward. ED can continue to facilitate college access while incenting and supporting institutions to increase completion rates, but large-scale programs such as those proposed by the Administration will be even more impactful.

&amp;nbsp;

EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS

Students and their Families, States, Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs), Accrediting Agencies, Businesses, Philanthropy, Not-for-Profit Organizations, and other Federal Departments and Agencies (particularly the Departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Justice, Labor, Veterans Affairs, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau).

ED's strategy to implement the President's College Value and Affordability Agenda comprises two areas of focus: (1) promoting evidence-based innovation and competition that lead to increased completion so that colleges offer students a greater range of affordable, high-quality options than they do today, and (2) fostering institutional and student accountability in tandem with better consumer awareness. These strategies aim to support college attainment by reducing the cost and amount of time necessary to attain a degree, by measuring college performance and providing consumer information about cost and outcomes, by supporting the use of open educational low-cost textbooks, and by incentivizing state, institutional and student behavior.

&amp;nbsp;

Next steps in promoting innovation and competition in the postsecondary education sector include:

&amp;nbsp;


	Continuing to convene and develop communities of practice with minority-serving community colleges in an effort to share and scale up evidence-based best practices, especially in providing efficient remedial education that leads to completion.
	Announcing approved participants for Experimental Sites pilots in student loan counseling, Educational Quality Through Innovative Partnerships (EQUIP), and Competency-Based Education in FY 2017.
	Announcing awards in the third competition in the Performance Partnership Pilots for Disconnected Youth program.


&amp;nbsp;

Next steps for fostering institutional and student accountability include:

&amp;nbsp;


	Publishing final regulations on state authorization of distance education programs by December 2016, with implementation going into effect in 2018.
	Continuing to work with institutions to collect and validate institutional program data under the Gainful Employment regulations, working toward publication of the first report in early 2017. The regulations ensure that institutions improve their outcomes for students in occupationally-oriented programs (and inform prospective students of program outcomes), or risk losing access to federal student aid.
	Considering further enhancements of the College Scorecard to help students make informed college choices, including additional cautionary flags that consumers should be aware of before deciding to enroll in an institution. Longer-term goals include expanding completion data to include outcomes for part-time students and returning or transfer-in students, and developing program-level earnings information.
	Continuing to highlight the practices of institutions of higher education that are doing noteworthy work to enroll and graduate low-income students, such as by regular postings on the “Completion Chronicles.”
	Announcing awards in December 2016 for the Scalable Strategies to Support College Completion Network, funded by the Department’s Institute of Education Sciences. The grants will fund up to three new Research Teams to join the existing teams, and will fund a Network Lead.
	Highlighting institutions of higher education that are implementing best practices that support Veterans and Service members and which have strong student outcomes.
	&amp;nbsp;
	Creating a new Accrediting Agencies Reporting Activities for Institutions and Programs information collection system.
	Publishing two white papers from convened group of deans of schools of education at Hispanic-Serving Institutions in December 2016 that address high-quality teacher preparation programs.
	Continuing to add priorities focused on evidence, student success, and completion in grant competitions where appropriate.
	Working with Congress on the pending reauthorization of the Higher Education Act and the Perkins Career and Technical Education Act to advance the Administration’s priorities on advancing college access and success, including improving student outcomes such as on-time completion.
	Looking to FY 2017, the Department expects to offer new awards via 11 grant competitions. Eight will include evidence (Upward Bound, GEARUP State and Partnership, Upward Bound Math/Science, SIP, Ronald E. McNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement, Developing Hispanic-Serving Institutions, and Veterans Upward Bound).

</next_steps><progress_update>
	Announced final borrower defense regulations on October 28, 2016 (subsequently published in the Federal Register on November 1), which provide new protections for borrowers and taxpayers against fraud, deception, and other misconduct by postsecondary institutions. The new regulations take effect July 1, 2017 for most provisions.
	Published a proposed rule for state authorization of distance education programs on July 22, 2016, designed to ensure accountability for institutions serving students across the country through online programs.
	Released final regulations on teacher preparation on October 12, 2016 (http://www.ed.gov/teacherprep). The regulations aim to bring transparency to the effectiveness of teacher preparation programs, provide programs with ongoing feedback to help them improve continuously, and respond to educators across the country who do not feel ready to enter the classroom after graduation. On September 22-23, the Department convened deans of schools of education at Hispanic-Serving Institutions to discuss culturally-competent teaching and high-quality preparation programs; the group will produce two white papers in December 2016.
	Released updated data for the College Scorecard on September 14, 2016 (https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/). The Department also produced a College Scorecard toolkit and informational video, which were sent to state school officers and posted on the Scorecard website (https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/assets/College-Scorecard-Toolkit.pdf and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyYsUrW9OTA&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be). The Office of the First Lady produced a Reach Higher back-to-school video that featured the Scorecard.
	Implemented further simplification for the 2017-2018 FAFSA (https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=ED-2016-ICCD-0036-0076) that allows students to complete and submit a FAFSA earlier (beginning in October, rather than January), and report income from two years prior so they do not need to wait for new IRS tax data. These changes will allow students to learn about their Federal financial aid eligibility earlier and help families have a more accurate picture of college costs sooner in the college selection process. Preliminary data on application volume for the 2017-2018 cycle show an increase over the same period last year.
	Collected public comment on accreditor terminology reporting guidance, a new information collection system for Accrediting Agencies Reporting Activities for Institutions and Programs. The notice, published in April 2016 and published for a second public comment period in October 2016, was related to the establishment/design of a new information collection system for accrediting agencies to submit required information to the Department. Currently, the Department’s Office of Postsecondary Education receives notification of accrediting agency actions via email or regular mail, and then forwards to Federal Student Aid and other internal offices as required. This new electronic reporting system will reduce staff workload, reduce errors, and prevent mishandling of this critical information. The Department also re-constructed the accreditation home page to better inform the public regarding the Secretary’s recognition process and to provide a one-stop information repository for accreditation-related information (http://www.ed.gov/accreditation/)..
	Announced the second annual convening of minority-serving community colleges “communities of practice,” to be held November 1-2, 2016. The communities of practice share practices to improve student success. The Department secured a contractor to assist with the November convening as well as additional technical assistance via webinars and virtual communities of practice throughout FY 2017.
	With the Department of Labor, published the final joint Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) regulations on August 19, 2016 related to unified and combined state plans, performance, and the one-stop system (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/08/19/2016-15977/workforce-innovation-and-opportunity-act-joint-rule-for-unified-and-combined-state-plans-performance). Each agency also issued Title-specific regulations. Since then, the Departments continue to collaborate on issuing joint guidance and technical assistance to support successful implementation. Joint guidance on performance accountability, the one-stop system (general operational as well as specific infrastructure costs), and privacy protection and data sharing are in various stages of development and clearance. A series of WIOA virtual technical assistance events has been scheduled to accompany the release of the guidance. Additionally, the Departments have collaborated on an Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) program memorandum to provide guidance to states on the requirement surrounding the competition for AEFLA funds. That program memorandum is expected to be released in mid-October. WIOA reforms adult education training and services, including in the areas of English language acquisition and vocational rehabilitation for individuals with disabilities.
	Conducted a meeting on September 23, 2016 of community college leaders who are implementing promising practices in the alignment of adult education and developmental education in support of student success and completion. Meeting participants provided the Department with suggestions for dissemination approaches and strategies for sharing lessons learned from the Department’s Supporting Student Success national leadership activity. Final product development and dissemination is underway.
	Invited eight institutions of higher education (IHEs) to continue to Phase 3 of the selection process for the EQUIP (Educational Quality through Innovative Partnerships) experiment. In Phase 3, these IHEs will begin to set up their proposed programs and apply to the Department for final approval, which is expected during FY 2017.
	Published a notice on August 15, 2016 announcing a loan counseling experiment under the Experimental Sites Initiative (https://ifap.ed.gov/fregisters/FR081516.html). Under this experiment, participating institutions will have the flexibility to develop and require additional loan counseling for student borrowers beyond the statutorily required one-time entrance and one-time exit counseling, and will test the results of that counseling in improving borrowers’ academic and repayment outcomes.
	Developed a report on Advancing Diversity and Inclusion in Higher Education, subsequently released in tandem with a White House convening on November 18, 2016. The report presents data showing educational inequities and opportunity gaps, along with key trends in the challenges that underrepresented students—particularly students of color—face in accessing and completing a high-quality postsecondary education. The report also draws upon research and case studies to describe evidence-based and promising practices that postsecondary institutions across the nation are effectively using to increase, retain, and graduate underrepresented students.
	Advised the Department of Defense on changes to the Accessing Higher Education (AHE) curriculum that is offered to service members as they transition out of the military and apply for college. The AHE now includes training on the use of College Scorecard. The Department also is developing an Education Counseling for Veterans online landing page that summarizes Department programs that support Veterans (Veterans Upward Bound, Education Opportunity Centers, and Centers of Excellence for Veteran Student Success), and is working with Veterans Affairs and Defense to provide links to this resource in order to promote these programs to the Veterans community.
	Announced seven grant competitions that encouraged evidence-based strategies. The TRIO Talent Search competition included competitive preference priorities for moderate evidence of effectiveness and evidence of promise regarding mentoring and tutoring strategies that successfully transition students into postsecondary education. Under Talent Search, the Department made awards to 478 successful applicants, all proposing strategies that met the standard for Moderate Evidence of Effectiveness. The TRIO Educational Opportunity Centers (EOC) competition included evidence (strong theory) as a selection criterion. The Department made 160 awards to successful applicants in the EOC competition. In the Minority-Serving Institutions (MSI) program competitions, the Department offered applicants competitive preference points to connect strategies to the moderate evidence or evidence of promise standard. A total of 122 awards were made across four MSI programs (Hispanic Serving Institutions–STEM, Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions, Alaska Native and Native-Hawaiian-Serving Institutions, and Native American-Serving Nontribal Institutions). In addition, the Department funded additional applicants from the FY 2015 Strengthening Institutions Program (SIP) (moderate evidence) and Hispanic-Serving Institutions (strong theory) slates. The Department made 47 and 30 awards in those programs, respectively.
	Co-hosted a two-day event with associations, philanthropic organizations, and other federal agencies on July 26-27, 2016, titled &quot;Strengthening Work-Based Learning in Education and Transitions to Careers.” This event explored how work-based learning experiences can integrate young people into long-term career pathways and academic success, and is the fifth in a series of six workshops that are part of a research and technical assistance project being conducted by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). This workshop was co-hosted by U.S. Federal agencies, national associations, and philanthropic organizations, and focused on the need for work-based learning in skill development to achieve better economic and social outcomes. Participants reviewed initial analytical work by the OECD on the topic of work-based learning and school-to-work transition for at-risk youth; reviewed other research and promising practices on work-based learning in the US and participating countries; and facilitated dialogue among countries on program and policy solutions for expanding work-based learning.
	Awarded a $2 million Career Technical Education (CTE) Pay for Success (PFS) grant. This grant will conduct the first two of three phases of a PFS project: a feasibility analysis in four local CTE sites, and transaction structuring for those local sites where a PFS project is deemed feasible. PFS means that the government (or another entity like a hospital) only pays once an intervention achieves certain positive outcomes, as determined by a rigorous evaluation. The results of testing a PFS funding model will help the Department determine whether higher levels of performance can be achieved in terms of student outcomes in CTE programs.
	In collaboration with the White House, announced the grand prize winner in the Reach Higher Mobile App Challenge. The winner, ThinkZone Games, will further develop its mobile app solution to help students navigate education and career pathways in planning for their future.
	Prepared the public notice to announce the Ed Sim Challenge. The Challenge calls upon the gaming, developer, and educational technology communities to design simulated environments that prepare students for a more competitive world through high-quality career and technical education. The Challenge was announced in conjunction with White House events on November 2.
	As part of the Interagency Working Group on Federal Supports for Postsecondary Access and Success, drafted a joint letter by six Secretaries (ED, Agriculture, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Labor, and Treasury), which was subsequently released on November 15. The letter addresses state agencies, colleges, and stakeholders, showing the latest guidance and resources that clarify how existing provisions within federal programs can be better aligned for postsecondary access and completion. The working group plans additional joint activities in support of access and completion for low-income students in the future.
	Published a notice on August 15, 2016 inviting applications for the third round (FY 2016) of the Performance Partnership Pilots for Disconnected Youth (P3) (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/08/15/2016-19294/applications-for-new-awards-performance-partnership-pilots). The deadline for applications is October 31, 2016. To publicize the opportunity, the Department sent an email announcement to nearly 1,000 project directors of Department grants that are eligible to be included in a P3 pilot and participated in conference calls with Promise Zone liaisons and My Brother’s Keeper communities. The Department encouraged its six partner agencies to be assertive in marketing the opportunity to their stakeholders as well. During September 2016, the Department also awarded $1.3 million in supplemental funds to eight of the round one pilot projects that had sought funds to strengthen their evaluations or to enhance other aspects of their projects. P3 tests innovative strategies to achieve better outcomes for disconnected youth.
	So far, Congress has not funded the proposed America’s College Promise initiative, which would provide free community college in return for state reforms that would support college completion. Nor did Congress provide funding in FY 2016 for a third competition of the innovative, evidence-based First in the World grant program. While the Senate introduced an appropriations bill that would implement the Department’s proposed Pell for Accelerated Completion reform, it did not introduce the accompanying On-Track Pell Bonus program to encourage students to take enough credits to graduate on time, and the House did not introduce either provision. These programs would provide the Department key leverage to impact completion in significant ways.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Dramatically boosting completion rates for bachelor’s and associate degrees is essential for Americans to compete in a global economy. The President thus set a goal in 2009—that, by 2020, the U.S. will have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world. Meeting this goal will require millions of additional Americans to earn a bachelor’s or an associate degree or certificate by the end of this decade—a 50 percent increase nationwide. The President has also challenged every American to complete at least one year of higher education or career training—at a two- or four-year postsecondary institution, or through a vocational training program or apprenticeship.
 
The President’s agenda for postsecondary reform calls for a spirit of shared responsibility in addressing college access, affordability, quality, and the imperative for students to complete their certificates or degrees. Neither the federal government alone, nor any other single sector, can make the investments or create changes needed to move our country forward. This work requires unprecedented collaboration and innovation.
 
And, increased college enrollment is not enough. To advance the nation toward achieving the 2020 goal, institutions of higher education must ensure that students successfully complete with degrees and certificates. In addition, as part of its career and technical education (CTE) transformation strategy, the Department must help support state- and industry-led efforts to introduce students to careers and provide them with the knowledge and skills to enter technical fields. Furthermore, to ensure a sustainable national economy, the Department should work with the National Science Foundation and other agencies to help colleges and universities increase the enrollment and completion rates of students with degrees and certificates in fields related to science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).
 
The Department must ensure that all students—recent high school graduates and adult learners alike—are well prepared for college and careers, help more of them enroll in postsecondary education, and increase the number of those who complete programs of study with a degree or certificate.
 
Prior to entering postsecondary education, prospective students need easily accessible information on the cost of attendance, career placement and graduation rates, college loan default rates, earnings of graduates, public-service and private-sector opportunities, loan management options, and other subjects crucial to understanding the affordability and value of the postsecondary institutions and/or programs of study that they are considering. Students deserve to know that, whether they enter a college, university, postsecondary career training program, or adult education program, the credential they earn will be affordable and its value will be recognized as an indication that they possess the necessary knowledge and skills for success in the workplace and in life.
 
Providing federal student aid in a simple, reliable, and efficient manner is the main way that the Department supports college access, affordability, quality, and completion. In FY 2012, the Department delivered nearly $142 billion in grants, work-study, and loan assistance to approximately 15 million postsecondary students and their families. These students attended approximately 6,200 institutions of postsecondary education accredited by dozens of agencies. In addition, the Department administers $2 billion annually in grants to strengthen postsecondary institutions and promote college readiness, and another $2 billion in grant funds for CTE, adult education (including literacy and citizenship education), and correctional education to help adults secure the skills that equip them for work, civic participation, and lifelong learning.
 
The Department has already taken significant steps to increase college access, affordability, quality, and completion. Through the SAFRA Act, passed as part of the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (HCERA), Congress ended student loan subsidies to banks, saving billions of dollars that are now used for financial aid through the Pell Grant program and for reducing borrowers’ monthly repayment amounts. Resources developed by the Department, such as the College Affordability and Transparency Center, the Financial Aid Shopping Sheet, the College Scorecard, and a consolidated student aid website from the Department’s Federal Student Aid (FSA) office (www.studentaid.gov), now provide students and families with better tools for informed decision-making. Additionally, as generally described in FSA’s Five Year Strategic Plan for FY 2012-16, FSA recently launched two new products.  The first product is the Financial Aid Toolkit, which provides free and ready-made resources online for organizations wishing to engage students about financial aid.  The second is the Financial Awareness Counseling Tool (FACT), an online, interactive loan counseling tool that helps students and families better manage their finances and understand their financial obligations as borrowers.  FSA initiated the Integrated Student Experience (ISE) initiative to establish an integrated, customer-focused web experience for students, parents and borrowers to facilitate decision-making about funding postsecondary education.  Finally, the Department has simplified the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) so it is easier and faster for students to apply for aid.
 
During the next four years, the Department will build on these efforts to ensure that all Americans, regardless of background, will have the opportunity to access and complete an affordable postsecondary degree or other postsecondary credential.
How will we measure success?  
 
The Department will use the following indicators to measure its success in improving college access and affordability, college completion, academic quality, and STEM pathway opportunities.
 
Postsecondary Education, Career and Technical Education, and Adult Education Indicators of Success
 
Reduce rate of increase in average net price of public two- and four-year institutions
Decrease number of low-performing institutions
Increase degree attainment among 25-34 year old age cohort
Increase retention rate of first-time degree-seeking undergraduates
Increase number of STEM postsecondary credentials awarded
Percent of high school seniors filing a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)
Increase the national earnings of adults and transition-age youth with disabilities, including those with significant disabilities
Increase the number of  stakeholders, including Vocational Rehabilitation State Directors and other State Vocational Rehabilitation staff who express knowledge of NIDRR[1] grantee research
Increase the number of NIDRR supported grantee projects providing training to stakeholders on disability issues
 
What could hold us back?  What’s beyond our control?  (External Risk Factors)
The Department will encourage states and institutions of higher education to adopt policies and strategies to improve student outcomes and even out or minimize increases in the cost of tuition, books, and related items. Success will depend, to some degree, on the extent to which states and institutions (a) implement policies and programs to increase student retention and persistence to graduation, (b) accelerate college completion, (c) offer dual high school and postsecondary enrollments, (d) develop and use online, open‑source materials, (e) better align high school completion and postsecondary entrance requirements, (f) better align transfer requirements that lead to baccalaureate degrees, and (g) invest in higher education at the state level.  The Department has limited ability to influence such outcomes without new programs that are specifically structured to drive this kind of change. In addition, modifications to statewide longitudinal and other data systems are necessary to better track the nation’s progress in improving access to postsecondary education, completion of postsecondary degrees and certificates, and success in the workforce and society.  Finally, high-quality technical assistance is needed to address the limited capacity of states and school districts to advance programs in high-need areas, such as STEM.
The nation also sorely needs the reauthorization of key federal legislation, including the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), the Workforce Investment Act (WIA), the Higher Education Act (HEA), and the Career and Technical Education Act (CTEA), in order to support the implementation of more rigorous high school standards and postsecondary and adult education reforms that will increase student achievement and career and civic success.  Moreover, postsecondary institutions must increase their capacity to serve the growing number of Americans who require education and/or training beyond high school to compete in the workplace, particularly the tens of millions of Americans who have basic literacy and workforce training needs.  In an economy where state funding for higher education is threatened, institutions are struggling to serve more students with fewer resources.  In addition, many students arrive at college unprepared for college-level work. This need for remediation diverts resources that would be better directed toward supporting students’ persistence in and completion of their education.  To be effective in all of these areas, postsecondary institutions must continue to find ways to be innovative and productive in providing educational services—even as they collaborate with the pre-K – 12 sector to improve the college- and career-readiness of learners.
Historically, as unemployment rates decline, the number of young adults immediately pursuing a postsecondary education decreases.  This, in turn, potentially decreases FAFSA completion rates. In addition, other economic factors contributed to the large and likely unsustainable increases in FAFSA submissions for several cycles through 2012.  With a still-improving economy, completion rates have yet to stabilize and may affect overall FAFSA completion rates.  To address these external factors, the Department and FSA will continue to focus efforts on increasing FAFSA accessibility and ease of use.  To ensure a positive experience for users, FSA will enhance partnerships with states, federal agencies, nonprofits, and the private sector to ensure a positive experience for users.
