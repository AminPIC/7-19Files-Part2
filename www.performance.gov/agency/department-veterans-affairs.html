                        <p>President Lincoln's immortal words - delivered in his Second Inaugural Address more than 140 years ago - describe better than any others the mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs.  We care for Veterans, their families, and survivors - men and women who have responded when their Nation needed help.  Our mission is clear-cut, direct, and historically significant.  It is a mission that every employee is proud to fulfill.</p>
<p>VA fulfills these words by providing world-class benefits and services to the millions of men and women who have served this country with honor in the military.  President Lincoln's words guide the efforts of approximately 280,000 VA employees who are committed to providing the best medical care, benefits, social support, and lasting memorials that Veterans and their depoendents deserve in recognition of Veterans' service to this Nation.</p>

<div class="intro_text">
<p>Established by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goals are a tool used to accelerate progress on a limited number of priority areas where implementation requires active collaboration between multiple agencies, overcoming organizational barriers to achieve better performance than one agency can achieve on its own.</p>
<p>Set or revised at least every four years, CAP Goals include outcome-oriented goals that cover a limited number of crosscutting policy areas as well as management goals focused on management improvements across the Federal Government in areas of financial management, strategic human capital management, information technology management, procurement and acquisition management, and real property management.</p>
<p>A series of 16 CAP Goals were announced in the 2015 Budget with clearly named accountable officials, data-driven reviews that incorporated a broad range of quantitative and qualitative inputs, and reporting to the public through a common website as a framework to drive performance improvements on cross-government collaboration and tackle government-wide management challenges affecting most agencies.</p>

<p>On June 30, 2016, the President signed into law the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 – nearly 50 years after President Johnson signed the original FOIA into law.  This critical legislation reflects the progress made by the Administration, codifies a number of openness and transparency principles, and ensures that the Administration’s track record of openness is institutionalized throughout government and carries forward for years to come.  Concurrent with the signing of the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, the White House released a Fact Sheet committing the Administration to:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Utilizing the Chief FOIA Officers Council and FOIA Advisory Committee to address FOIA’s greatest challenges;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promoting broader release of records through a “release to one is a release to all” presumption;</p>

</div>  </div>  
  <div class="views-field views-field-field-cag-overview-revision-id">    <span class="views-label views-label-field-cag-overview-revision-id">Overview: </span>    <div class="field-content"><p>On March 19, 2015, the President issued Executive Order 13693, <em>Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade</em>, which set forth ambitious climate, energy, and environmental sustainability goals for Federal agencies over the next decade.  Executive departments and agencies have been among our Nation’s leaders as the United States works to build a clean energy economy that will sustain our prosperity and the health of our people and our environment for generations to come. Federal leadership in energy, environmental water, transportation fleets, buildings, and acquisition management will continue to drive national greenhouse gas reductions and support preparations for the impacts of climate change. The Federal Government has the opportunity to significantly reduce direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2025, while at the same time fostering innovation, reducing spending, and strengthening the communities in which our Federal facilities operate. </p>
<p>Employing this strategy for the next decade calls for expanded and updated Federal environmental performance goals with a clear overarching objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions across Federal operations and the Federal supply chain.  Goals for greenhouse gas emissions reduction (40% by 2025), renewable electricity (30% by 2025), clean energy (25% by 2025), and performance contracting ($4 billion in awarded contracts by Dec. 2016) are already well established in the Federal community. The enhanced target for each of these goals will require agencies to sharpen their focus on achieving the goals through existing mechanisms and new technologies that enhance efficiency and use of clean energy.</p>
<p>CEQ and OMB have worked closely to ensure that Federal agencies understand the necessary steps to pursuing the new environmental sustainability goals and those efforts are supported by an interagency Steering Committee.  Pursuit of these sustainability goals will involve at least 25 of the largest Federal agencies. Success will be greatly enhanced by the cross-cutting nature of the goals and the similarity in the tools and procedures used for implementation.</p>
<p>While all Federal agencies have an important role to play in ensuring the Government meets its energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets, key delivery agencies include: The General Services Administration, Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Energy, National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Department of Homeland Security.</p>

In the wake of increasing threats and incidents, the President directed a series of reviews to examine current security, suitability/fitness, and credentialing processes and to recommend areas in need of reform. The interagency reviews identified problem areas and made specific recommendations, which were approved by the Performance Accountability Council (PAC). The PAC developed the Strategic Intent to build upon these efforts and create a lasting impact by providing overarching strategic direction to personnel security, suitability/fitness, and credentialing reform efforts for the next five years.  </p>
<p>The Strategic Intent represents our framework for sustaining progress mandated by the February 2014 Suitability and Security Processes Review Report to the President, the January 2016 PAC Review of Background Investigations, relevant legislation, and other key drivers. It builds on progress since the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 and the subsequent, significant reform efforts that resulted in greater standardization and alignment of suitability and security processes. Through this framework, the PAC will work with other members of the Executive Branch to drive continuous process improvement to personnel security, suitability/fitness, and credentialing programs and address evolving threats. While we cannot eliminate risk altogether, it is imperative that we work across disciplines to maximize our collective efforts to mitigate the risks we face, while ensuring appropriate protections for privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. We must ensure measures to improve these programs avoid imposing unreasonable burdens on the Federal workforce that could negatively impact operations. Therefore, the Federal Government will pursue a balanced approach by addressing the risks posed by personnel who could do significant harm by virtue of the nature of their position.</p>
<p>These reforms will further support ongoing Insider Threat Program implementation by providing earlier detection and improving the quality of vetting. The improved attention to cybersecurity will reinforce efforts to protect sensitive mission data, including personally-identifiable information. </p>

According to AT Kearney’s Foreign Direct Investment Confidence Index, confidence in the U.S. as a location for FDI is high, ranking as the top destination for investment ahead of China, Brazil, Canada, and India.<sup>1 </sup>The U.S. remains the world’s largest economy and is also the largest recipient of foreign direct investment in the world. Over the last ten years, U.S. affiliates of foreign companies have employed more than five million workers, the majority of which are high-paying manufacturing jobs. On average, jobs created by FDI in United States pay up to 30% more.<sup>2</sup>  However, due to global capital mobility and increased foreign competition, we need to take steps to maintain and grow our share of global investment.</p>
<p>Historically, we have left our states and cities to compete for investments with a country’s investment promotion agency, limiting our opportunities to clearly demonstrate our commitment to attracting investment and to leverage our advantages as a top destination for investment. In 2011, through Executive Order, the U.S. launched SelectUSA, the first Federal effort to promote and facilitate inbound business investment. The E.O. created the Interagency Investment Working Group (IIWG) to further design and implement the first-ever coordinated U.S. investment promotion authority. As a driver for success, the global investment team, consisting of both SelectUSA headquarters in DC and investment teams at posts led by Ambassadors, will increase the number of active investment cases touched to encourage business investments.</p>
<p>At the first SelectUSA Investment Summit in Oct 31-Nov. 1 2013, the President reformed SelectUSA, creating a number of firsts: for the first time there will be a clear system for advocacy for high-priority, job-creating investments, driven by the most senior Administration officials all the way up to the President; for the first time there will be a single point of contact for ready investors looking to bring jobs and production to the U.S.; lastly, the Administration is engaging in unprecedented coordinated support for states and localities to attract investment.</p>
<p>Key contributing agencies to the Job-Creating Investment CAP goal include the Department of Commerce, Small Business Administration, US Department of Agriculture, Department of State, Department of Homeland Security, and Export-Import Bank of the U.S.</p>

Over time, the process and legal requirements for the permitting and review of major infrastructure projects have developed in a siloed and ad-hoc way, creating complex processes that in some cases have taken years or longer to complete.  Although there are several reasons why a major infrastructure project may be delayed (including applicant funding uncertainty and state and local reviews), over the past three years the Administration has undertaken an ambitious effort to modernize the Federal government’s role in permitting and review processes.</p>
<p>To ensure his Administration took action to modernize these permitting and review processes, on March 22, 2012, the President signed Executive Order 13604, Improving Performance of Federal Permitting and Review of Infrastructure Projects and subsequently a Presidential Memorandum on May 17, 2013, charging an interagency Steering Committee to lead the development of a plan to turn best practices into standard practice.  This Implementation Plan identifies four strategies, 15 reforms, and nearly 100 both near-term and long-term milestones.  The strategies are:</p>
<ul><li>Strategy 1: Institutionalize Interagency Coordination and Transparency, by formalizing interagency coordination policies, including early identification of a lead agency; synchronizing Federal review and permitting processes and decisions; standardizing the use of the Infrastructure Permitting Dashboard; and identifying best practices for early engagement with State, Local and Tribal governments.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Strategy 2:  Improve Project Planning, Siting, and Application Quality by developing tools to assist project applicants in planning for a major infrastructure project and support effective and timely decision-making by agency staff once the Federal processes begins. </li>
</ul><ul><li>Strategy 3: Improve Permitting Reviews and Mitigation by supporting agency staff in effectively implementing existing regulations, policies, and guidance as well as identifying barriers. This strategy also includes policies to facilitate advance planning for the mitigation of project impacts and landscape- or watershed-level approaches to mitigation, where appropriate.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Strategy 4: Drive Continued Improvement.  Fully implementing these actions and achieving the President’s goal will require a team dedicated to implementing the reforms on an interagency basis, further analyze agency processes, and identify additional reforms.  This strategy includes a proposal to establish a dedicated interagency team to support the ongoing improvement of Federal permitting and review responsibilities for major infrastructure projects.  In addition, this strategy includes a proposal to develop reliable metrics to track timeframes and outcomes for communities and the environment.</li>

Advances in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) have long been central to our Nation’s ability to manufacture better and smarter products, improve health care, develop cleaner and more efficient domestic energy sources, preserve the environment, safeguard national security, and grow the economy. For the United States to maintain its preeminent position in the world it will be essential that the Nation continues to lead in STEM, but evidence indicates that current educational pathways are not leading to a sufficiently large and well-trained STEM workforce to achieve this goal, nor is the U.S. education system cultivating a culture of STEM education necessary for a STEM-literate public. Thus it is essential that the United States enhance U.S. students’ engagement in STEM disciplines and inspire and equip many more students to excel in STEM fields.</p>
<p>A number of Federal agencies place a high priority on STEM education and have developed education initiatives unique to their agency’s mission, needs, and resources.  To better leverage Federal assets, expertise, and partnerships toward a goal of national importance, a cross agency priority to improve STEM education has been developed to increase agency coordination and use of evidence-based approaches to improve P-12 STEM instruction, increase and sustain youth and public engagement in STEM, enhance the STEM experience of undergraduate students, better serve groups historically underrepresented in STEM fields, design graduate education for tomorrow’s STEM workforce, build new models for leveraging assets and expertise, and build and use evidence-based approaches. </p>

</div>  </div>  
  <div class="views-field views-field-field-cag-overview-revision-id">    <span class="views-label views-label-field-cag-overview-revision-id">Overview: </span>    <div class="field-content"><p>The American people deserve a Government that is responsive to their needs. Citizens and businesses expect government services to be well-designed, efficient, and generally comparable to the services they receive from leading private sector organizations. Whether they call the IRS for an answer to a tax question or visit a Social Security Administration office to adjust their benefits, they should experience high-quality interactions with the Federal Government. Despite some important strides to improve customer service over the past fifteen years, too often many Federal Government services fail to meet the expectations of citizens and business, creating unnecessary hassle and cost for citizens, businesses, and the government itself.  The Federal Government must keep pace with the public’s expectations and transform its customer services – soliciting regular customer feedback, streamlining processes, and delivering consistent quality service across customer channels.</p>
<p>To that end, in April 2011 the President issued an<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/27/executive-order-streamlining-service-delivery-and-improving-customer-ser" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/27/executive-order-streamlining-service-delivery-and-improving-customer-ser">Executive Order</a> requiring each agency to develop a customer service plan that identified implementation steps for their customer service activities, including a "signature initiative" that uses technology to improve the customer experience. Agencies posted the plans on their Open Government websites in October 2011, and this goal will build on these plans to streamline and improve customer service delivery.</p>
<p>To build upon the progress being made by individual agencies, the Administration is taking action to deliver improved customer service across the Federal enterprise.  The Administration will:</p>
<ul><li><em>Streamline transactions.</em>  Too often the processes and procedures of government have been developed piecemeal over time, and have not been regularly reexamined to ensure they are designed with the user experience in mind.  The Administration will identify transactions with a high impact on a significant number of citizens and streamline processes, better meet customer needs, and use performance measures to improve services.  This includes areas such as TSA security screening, veterans’ pension and disability applications, income-based repayment of student loans, Social Security, and taxpayer assistance.</li>
<li><em>Develop standards for high impact services.</em>  Citizen expectations for government services are continually increasing, driven by improvements in technology and the high quality services provided by the private sector.  Government leaders have a responsibility to understand customer expectations and service needs, and continually evaluate and improve their effectiveness in meeting those needs.  To facilitate this, many government programs that provide direct services to the public can benefit from setting customer service standards, clearly communicating these standards to customers, and ensuring these standards are being met.  The Administration will identify best practices in setting customer service standards, such as placing an emphasis on first contact resolution, and facilitate implementation of these practices for high impact services.</li>
<li><em>Utilize technology to improve the customer experience.</em>  The Administration will work to deliver world-class customer services to citizens by making it faster and easier for individuals and businesses to complete transactions with government online.  Given the continually growing importance of online services, the Administration has established a separate Cross-Agency Priority Goal to focus resources and attention on this priority area. </li>

The Administration will work with agencies to utilize existing authorities to attract top talent and consult with Agencies, the Office of Personnel Management, and Congressional stakeholders to expand the use of flexible hiring authorities. The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will also work with Agencies to incubate and scale new approaches to the design, development and delivery of top digital services and transactions.</li>
<li>Get the best companies working with government. The Administration’s efforts in this area will focus on streamlining the Federal IT acquisition process. Specific initiatives include creating more visibility of contracting opportunities for small, innovative companies; maximizing the use of available contracting flexibilities and best practices; and recommending administrative changes to the IT procurement processes.</li>
<li>Put the right processes and practices in place to drive outcomes and accountability. OMB will create and apply a new oversight and management process to highest impact IT investments in the Federal government. This process will include the best IT development and management approaches employed by the public and private sectors.  Lessons learned from this oversight process will be used to expand best practices across all agency IT investments.</li>

Today, proposals for contracts are lengthy, overly prescriptive, and laden with Government-specific requirements. There is also staggering duplication of contracts across Government and very little information sharing between agencies on pricing or other important contractual information. In order to fundamentally improve how taxpayer dollars are used in the Federal contracting space, the Administration is embarking on a comprehensive initiative to enhance collaboration and cooperation and drive greater innovation and improved performance through the implementation of Category Management.</p>
<p>This cross-agency priority (CAP) goal is focused on category management and will build on the progress made in the strategic sourcing initiative, leveraging the consolidated purchasing power of the Government to buy smarter and reduce duplication.  Category management is a new, more strategic approach that will enable the federal government to buy smarter and more like a single enterprise.  It involves identifying core areas of spend, developing heightened levels of expertise, leveraging shared best practices, providing streamlined solutions for acquisition, and managing supply and demand.  The objective is to increase efficiency and effectiveness while reducing costs and redundancies.  The first area of focus for category management is information technology and the CAP goal will support this initiative.  The objectives of the Category Management CAP goal will be expanded as the Category Management Leadership Council endorses other areas of focus.  The CAP Goal metrics can be found on the “supporting materials tabs” and progress updates will begin in the final Quarter of FY15.  </p>

If we are focused, committed, systematic, and intentional, we can make the sort of transformative changes in our service delivery approach that have altered the course of the commercial retail marketplace and reinvigorated American manufacturing. </p>
<p>We need to commit to driving efficiencies by creating opportunities to leverage existing resources and pool the government’s buying power.  This involves building common standards for underlying support activities and systems and driving out redundancy in administrative service provision.  It means changing agency expectations and incentives for spending.  And it means rethinking the way that the government considers and funds long-term investments in the systems and infrastructure that support customer service delivery. </p>
<p>The Federal Government will leverage the Executive Councils to develop common standards and benchmarks to measure shared service utilization, performance, and cost. Mandate those standards and benchmarks for common administrative services. From these standards and benchmarks we will drive efficiencies and greater performance by: 1) increasing the capacity of the Federal Shared Service Providers (SSPs) at DOI, USDA, Treasury, HHS, DOT and DOD; and 2) requiring use of lower-cost, higher-performing Shared Services for all agencies and SSPs which cannot meet established targets. We will target the following areas for Shared Services (listed in order of priority): financial, HR, technology, and acquisition.</p>

<p>The Administration will sustain and intensify these efforts in the second term by:</p>
<ul><li>Establishing cost and quality benchmarks for core/administrative operations, such as HR, Finance, Acquisition, and IT.  We will leverage the agency executive councils to develop common standards and benchmarks to measure shared service utilization, performance, and cost.  We will then use those standards and benchmarks for common administrative services as the baseline for driving continuous improvements in performance.</li>
<li>Cutting improper payments.

<p>The Administration has made significant progress in improving the management of information resources to increase interoperability and openness. In executive order 13642 President Obama outlined a clear vision for “Making Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information” wherever possible and legally permissible. The subsequently released Open Data Policy (OMB memorandum M-13-13) directed agencies to effectively “manage the information as a strategic asset” throughout its lifecycle and make data open by default to the extent permitted by law, while ensuring strict controls to safeguard individual privacy, confidentiality, and national security. </p>
<p>As a direct result, Americans are getting better access to government information and services they need. Homeowners who are struggling to pay their mortgages now get prompt, clear responses because companies are competing based on open consumer financial product complaint data published by CFPB, and can stay in their homes. Similarly, patients can now comparison shop to see which hospitals have the best outcomes and best prices thanks to data published by Medicaid and HHS—including a new dataset that for the first time shows what hospitals charge for inpatient services associated with the 100 most common kinds of hospital stays, revealing huge variations in hospital charges across the country and even within metro areas.</p>
<p>To drive further impact and results, the Open Data CAP Goal will focus on a series of government-wide objectives, strategies and major metrics that facilitate and gauge the outcome-oriented and management improvement goals of Open Data.  Metrics will prioritize three channels of impact measurement: impact on economic value creation organizations, impact on existing public program outcomes, and impact on internal government efficiency.  </p>

Though changes to policy or law may ultimately be needed to address workforce and cultural challenges across government, we can and should take actions to maximize the impact of our workforce within the existing environment.  We propose to:</p>
<ul><li>Create a Culture of Excellence and Engagement to Enable Higher Performance.  We will foster a culture of excellence by using data-driven approaches to enhance management, performance, and innovation across the current Federal workforce.  Specifically, we will focus on employee engagement (measured by employee views about their leaders, supervisors, and work experience), as multiple evaluations have demonstrated a strong correlation between employee engagement and an organization’s productivity.  Agencies can now get access to this data for over 13,000 work-level units across the country (up from just a few hundred units four years ago).  This level of specificity in data will provide agency managers with actionable information to target areas where improvement is needed most and where there are management best practices that can provide a model for success.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul><li>Build a World-Class Federal Management Team Starting with the Senior Executive Service (SES). To ensure a first-class Federal workforce long-term, we will invest in our civil service leadership by taking administrative actions that result in a broader experience and skill base across the Federal Executive Corps.  This includes addressing the “pain points” in the hiring process and enhancing training and accountability over the terms of their service.</li>
</ul><p> </p>

                    <p>Agencies establish a variety of organizational goals to drive progress toward key outcomes for the American people. Long-term strategic goals articulate clear statements of what the agency wants to achieve to advance its mission and address relevant national problems, needs, challenges and opportunities. Strategic objectives define the outcome or management impact the agency is trying to achieve, and also include the agency's role. Each strategic objective is tracked through a suite of performance goals, indicators and other evidence.

                            <div class='thingtoshoworhide' style='display: none'>VA, in collaboration with the Department of Defense, using both quantitative and qualitative research data from stakeholders, established an aggressive Agency Priority Goal for improving Veterans awareness and access to on-line information about their benefits. With frequent stakeholder engagement through focus work groups, survey instruments and user research, the eBenefits portal has delivered those self-service features that stakeholders find most relevant, thus increasing the number of users. Additionally, once these features are deployed, the stakeholders are again fully engaged to judge functionality and make recommendations for improvement.

<p>Numerous programs provide a broad spectrum of benefits and support services that assist Veterans and eligible beneficiaries. To enable Veterans and eligible beneficiaries to choose the best benefits and services for their needs, VA will improve coordination between our programs, leverage supportive interactions between programs, and reduce overlap across programs. Success will be measured by the differences made in the lives of the Veterans we serve, including decreasing Veteran unemployment, decreasing home foreclosures, decreasing homelessness, reducing processing times for disability compensation claims, increasing preventive care and healthy lifestyle changes, and increasing access to and utilization of virtual care modalities.</p>
<p><em>Strategies</em>:</p>
<p>VA will eliminate Veteran homelessness by the end of FY 2015. VA, in collaboration with its Federal partners, will continue to provide rehabilitation services for homeless and at-risk Veterans, including employment assistance, access to permanent and transitional housing, and other supportive services. As the number of homeless Veterans continues to decline, the focus will shift from rescue to prevention.</p>
<p>VA will improve Veteran career readiness to reduce Veteran unemployment. We will synchronize and align Veteran employment programs managed by VA, and improve coordination across the various Federal Veteran employment initiatives. We will increase support to our Veterans with disabilities and those who are GI Bill eligible through programs offering educational and vocational counseling. VA will increase support to Veteran entrepreneurs through public-private partnerships to provide capacity building and by providing access to Federal contracting opportunities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>VA will provide Veterans and eligible beneficiaries with personalized, proactive, patient-driven health care to optimize health and well-being, while providing state-of-the-art disease management. VA’s Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACT) will ensure patient engagement in self-care, preventive services, primary care, and mental health services. PACT is a partnership between the Veteran and the health care team with an emphasis on prevention, health promotion, and self-management. PACTs use a team-based approach, with various members of the team stepping in at different points in time to provide needed care. We will expand and refine, in coordination with DoD, research into the long-term consequences of TBI and PTSD. VA will increasingly seek to understand underlying health, injury and disorder mechanisms to create evidence-based diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation methods for Veterans and eligible beneficiaries with support from their families.</p>

<p>VA is a customer service organization. Complicated application processes, long processing timelines or difficulties getting information and appointments all impact the client’s experience and satisfaction. Veterans and eligible beneficiaries deserve a support system that is responsive to their needs. VA must keep pace with Veterans’ expectations and transform its customer services – soliciting regular customer feedback, streamlining processes, and delivering consistent service across customer-preferred channels.</p>
<p>We live in a connected world. The rapid pace of technological advancement is reshaping Veterans’ expectations regarding how services, benefits, and support should be delivered. Today’s client expects instant access to information and self-service options via the Internet, and increasingly through mobile devices like tablets and smartphones (and the next generation “smart” devices that are yet to be deployed).</p>
<p>To provide a personalized experience, we must listen, learn, and understand the needs and expectations of those we serve. We must have the knowledge, information and insight to understand why some choose not to fully engage with VA.</p>
<p><em>Strategies</em>:</p>
<p>VA will provide timely, accurate decisions on Veterans’ disability claims and eliminate the claims backlog. We will then implement a robust plan, and revisit procedures to ensure claims are addressed in no more than 125 days with at least 98 percent accuracy. The plan includes redesigning policies and procedures, continuing to enhance training for claims processors, and utilizing the most advanced IT. We will also increase the use of video teleconference hearings to address claims appeals.</p>
<p>VA will continue to expand implementation of PACT to improve partnerships with Veterans and eligible beneficiaries, increase team-based care coordination and management, and expand access to care. VA will improve patient-facing and clinician-facing e-health systems by expanding the development and use of health-related virtual modalities. These modalities include telehealth<a href="http://prep3.uat.performance.reisys.com/node/1013/edit?destination=node/5%3Fq%3Dviews/ajax%26page%3D1#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a>, E-Consult<a href="http://prep3.uat.performance.reisys.com/node/1013/edit?destination=node/5%3Fq%3Dviews/ajax%26page%3D1#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a>, secure messaging, MyHealtheVet, and mobile applications.</p>
<p>VA will enhance client satisfaction by capturing client data once, sharing it enterprise-wide, and using this client data for a lifetime, which will promote more efficient use of data across business lines. We will identify sources of consistent, reliable, and authoritative Veteran data. We will establish architecture, business rules, roles and responsibilities, and governance to enable VA lines of business to use the authoritative common client data to improve delivery of benefits and services to Veterans. VA will gain access to additional external data, knowledge, and experiences so we can broaden our understanding of our client’s needs and expectations. We will enable secure, privacy-protected electronic exchange of personal, health, and economic data on Veterans from induction oath through the final survivor benefit.</p>
<p>VA will rethink its operations as a Department, defining the fundamental crosscutting capabilities and interdependencies required to perform them. We will identify and address any internal organizational, policy, procedural, perceptual, and cultural boundaries that constrain our ability to coordinate, integrate, and deliver benefits and services.</p>
<p>VA will streamline its virtual presence (Web sites, portals and call centers), reducing duplication and enhancing personalization to enable clients to get the information they need, on their schedule.</p>
<p>VA will increase access to burial benefits in national cemeteries through its plans to construct five new national cemeteries and by recognizing and addressing the unique needs of Veterans and eligible beneficiaries who reside in densely populated urban areas as well as sparsely populated rural locations. We will ensure that the service and appearance of our national cemeteries meets the highest standards commensurate with these national shrines.</p>

But the experience is disjointed and inconsistent. There are hundreds of phone numbers and thousands of websites, each operating independently under different standards. Similarly, there are a wide array of VA and non-VA resources at the Federal, state, local, corporate, non-profit and tribal level that are not coherently organized or coordinated into a single source or reference point for the Veteran.  Veterans deserve better and so do VA staff, who care deeply about delivering the best possible outcome for Veterans.</p>
<p>The Veterans Experience team is leading a powerful new effort to improve customer experiences across VA, nationwide. Our goal: Fostering the delivery of effective and easy customer experiences in which Veterans feel valued. We are achieving this goal the same way the world’s most successful companies do: by listening to our customers – Veterans, their families and supporters – when they describe how they want things to work. Equally important, we are listening to our employees about obstacles to excellence on-the-job. Employee empowerment is an essential part of the equation. This is user-centered design. It puts Veterans and the employees who serve them front and center.</p>
<p>VA and the Veterans Experience team face a number of challenges and barriers:</p>
<ul><li>Siloed products and services without a common view of customers and their needs and wants.</li>
<li>Customer touchpoints and experiences owned by individual product and service teams, not integrated within a complementary suite of offerings.</li>
<li>Insular approach that does not account for the community resources used by customers.</li>
</ul><p>The APG will track our ability to overcome these barriers by implementing the strategies described in the next section.</p>
<p>To build trust among our customers, VA must consistently deliver customer experiences marked by effectiveness, ease, and engagement.<a href="http://www.performance.gov/node/62291/edit?add_indicator=#_ftn1">[1]</a> To ensure comparability across VA’s disparate service and product lines, the same measures of Trust and Customer Experience will be applied.</p>
<p><strong>Trust</strong></p>
<p>VA earns trust among Veterans by knowing them and showing that we care; by understanding and anticipating their needs; by providing fair benefits and timely services; by being there when they need us; and by keeping our promises. With every interaction, VA has the opportunity to deepen a trusting relationship with Veterans, or to diminish that trust.</p>
<p>Our Agency Priority Goal states: By September 30, 2017, VA will reach 90% agreement with the statement “I trust VA to fulfill our country’s commitment to Veterans.”</p>
<p>Timeline:</p>
<p>Q1 FY16:               Trust and Experience measures incorporated into existing customer experience surveys</p>
<p>Q2 FY16:               Baseline data collection begins</p>
<p>Q3 FY16:               Baseline measurement established; quarterly targets specified</p>
<p>Q4 FY 2016:          Publish quarterly update</p>
<p>Q1 FY 2017:          70 percent of VA customers surveyed ‘agree’ or ‘strongly agree’ with Trust  statement Customer Experience</p>
<p>Q2 FY 2017:          75 percent of VA customers surveyed ‘agree’ or ‘strongly agree’ with Trust statement Customer Experience</p>
<p>Q3 FY 2017:          80 percent of VA customers surveyed ‘agree’ or ‘strongly agree’ with Trust statement Customer Experience</p>
<p>Q4 FY17:               90% of VA customers surveyed ‘agree’ or ‘strongly agree’ with Trust statement</p>
<p><strong>Customer Experience</strong></p>
<p>Trust in VA is built one interaction at a time. The experience must be effective; it must be easy; and, ideally, it must be engaging and reflective of a valued, personal relationship with our customer. Trust is broken when VA does not consistently meet expectations in these three categories. VA will use customers’ ratings of their individual experiences as indicators of performance toward the overall Veterans Experience APG.</p>
<p>The measures will include level of agreement with questions such as:</p>
<ul><li>Effectiveness: “I got the service I needed.”</li>
<li>Ease: “It was easy to get the service I needed.”</li>
<li>Engagement: “I felt like a valued customer.”</li>
</ul><p>These measures are also new, and will be implemented along the timeline for the Trust measure indicated above. They will be added to new and existing VA customer experience surveys where responses will be correlated with operational data to highlight performance improvement opportunities that will improve Veterans experiences.</p>

On a single night in January 2014 during the Point in Time (PIT) Count <a href="http://c/Users/epbdmb/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.IE5/11GKRUOW/Homelessness%20APG%20(Feb_2014_Final_Update)%20kwh.docx#_ftn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, there were 49,933 homeless Veterans in the US.  Effectively ending homelessness among Veterans requires rapid access to permanent housing, health care, employment, benefits, and other supportive services.  VA works closely with community partners to meet current and new demands for any Veteran who is experiencing or is at imminent risk of homelessness.  Housing First and Rapid Re-housing are two of the many evidence-based approaches VA uses to end homelessness.  The Housing First model follows the philosophy of providing permanent housing as quickly as possible to Veterans/individuals experiencing homelessness and then wrapping health care and other supportive services as needed around the Veteran to sustain housing and improve their quality of life.  Rapid Re-housing is a set of strategies to help families quickly move out of homelessness and into permanent housing.  It typically involves:  housing search and landlord mediation assistance, short-term or flexible rental assistance, and transitional case management services.  Rapid Re-housing provides crisis intervention services to quickly place an individual or family who is currently homeless into a permanent, sustainable housing situation.</p>

<p>VA’s life-long engagement with its clients begins when Servicemembers first enter service and continues through the remainder of their lives. In support of this engagement, VA and DoD are working together to improve the access, quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of health care, benefits, and services provided to Servicemembers, Veterans, and other beneficiaries. VA will work closely with DoD to ensure that these benefits and services are delivered through an integrated client-centric approach that anticipates and addresses client needs; that the delivery of health care is provided through a patient-driven health care system that delivers quality, access, satisfaction and value consistently across the Departments; and through the efficiency of operations that are delivered through joint planning, training, and execution. The Departments must ensure that authorized beneficiary and health information is accessible, usable, shared, and secure in order to meet the needs of clients, customers, and stakeholders.</p>
<p><em>Strategies</em>:</p>
<p>VA and DoD will continue to work towards achieving these goals with its many DoD partners through the VA-DoD Joint Executive Committee (JEC) in order to improve business practices, ensure high-quality, cost effective services for both VA and DoD beneficiaries, facilitate opportunities to improve resource utilization and sharing, and to remove barriers that might impede collaborative efforts.</p>
<p>VA and DoD will create an authoritative source of health information for DoD and VA beneficiaries, which will include the delivery of a highly flexible, reliable, secure, maintainable, and sustainable systems. VA and DoD will jointly implement the separation health assessment based upon the joint common criteria established by the Departments. VA will continue to partner with DoD and increase the information and self-service capabilities available through the eBenefits portal for active duty Servicemembers and Veterans and eligible beneficiaries.</p>

<p>While VA is not the sole provider of benefits, services, and resources to Veterans and eligible beneficiaries, we hold ourselves accountable for each Veteran’s success, no matter who provides assistance. To provide Veterans and eligible beneficiaries an integrated, coordinated, personalized portfolio of benefits and services efficiently and effectively, we must improve our communication, coordination, and relationships with our partners in other Federal agencies; state, tribal, and local governments; VSOs; MSOs; academic affiliates; unions; nonprofits; and private industry. We must develop a partnership culture that entails trust, transparency, mutual benefit, responsibility, productivity, and accountability. Increased public-private partnership opportunities empower staff with effective tools and resources for collaborations, and allow for building open innovation platforms.</p>
<p><em>Strategies</em>:</p>
<p>VA will leverage responsible and productive partnership opportunities that can supplement VA services and help fill urgent or emerging gaps in services. We will pursue opportunities for partnering with organizations that can best provide what we cannot or should not.</p>
<p>VA will establish a partnership award program to acknowledge and recognize successful partnerships in various organizational and service categories.</p>
<p>VA will foster stronger collaboration and information exchange with across the spectrum of care, benefits and services providers.</p>

<p>VA recognizes that an organization is only as strong as its people, and realizes that it must build on successes and continue to transform the way it manages human capital. VA is a customer service organization. VA’s greatest asset is its workforce.</p>
<p>VA’s workforce must be able to adapt to the changing demographics, needs, and expectations of the Veteran population as well as changes in the workforce population. More than 30 percent of VA’s workforce is eligible for retirement, including roughly 50 percent of VA’s senior executives. Today, we have skills gaps in health care, acquisition, claims processing, human resources (HR), and IT, and we need to address those and build the workforce for tomorrow. The skills needed for success in the future are not the skills of today. VA must recruit, train, motivate, and lead its workforce with inspired and inspiring leadership. VA must consider human capital management and workforce planning as key enablers for every initiative or project we undertake in order to have the right people with the right skills in the right job at the right time.</p>
<p><em>Strategies</em>:</p>
<p>VA will identify the critical skills and competencies needed to achieve the best current and future results and develop workforce planning and development strategies that are tailored to address skills gaps. To fully succeed in transformation and continue on the successes built to date, VA will develop strategic leaders and build a cadre of talented successors in the federal government’s management and executive functions. VA will develop and cultivate leadership skills and build the pipeline for future leaders to ensure effective succession management plans.</p>
<p>VA will improve enterprise-wide governance of human capital management using a strategic approach that includes top management, employees, and other stakeholders. .</p>
<p>VA will improve strategic HCM by implementing an enterprise-wide, career development and training management program, and identifying organizational owners for occupational specialties.</p>
<p>VA will require ongoing development of leadership capabilities and develop enterprise-wide human capital strategies that, when implemented throughout the organization, will improve employee engagement, increase individual contribution and satisfaction by fostering ownership, empowerment, resiliency and commitment to serving Veterans and eligible beneficiaries.</p>

<p>The explosion of information capabilities available to all citizens via the Internet and mobile computing has forever changed how individuals communicate with each other and with providers of goods and services. Information “on demand” is now a core expectation; so is the ability to transact both work and personal business “anytime, anywhere.” These trends have resulted in tremendous changes to what individuals expect in terms of customer service as well as how they expect to manage their own work life and career. For VA this presents huge challenges and opportunities in terms of how it delivers services to Veterans and eligible beneficiaries and how it empowers its employees to perform their duties. New and emerging IT capabilities must be delivered that:</p>
<ul><li>Enable each Veteran to manage his/her relationship with VA in a unified manner, with both the Veteran and the VA employees serving them able to access and maintain a holistic view of the Veteran’s complete profile along with services entitled, available, and provided.</li>
<li>Enable Veterans and eligible beneficiaries, VA employees and trusted partners with the ability to access authorized VA-maintained information “anytime, anywhere.”</li>
<li>Enable VA employees with the flexibility to take advantage of emerging technologies to increase alternative work arrangements such as telework.</li>
</ul><p>Inherent in these capabilities is recognizing the need to continually evaluate and address concurrently emerging information security challenges. Safeguarding Federal computer systems and supporting critical IT infrastructure has been an ongoing Federal concern. Increased information sharing and use of mobile computing also serve to highlight the need to strengthen information security.</p>
<p><em>Strategies</em>:</p>
<p>VA will implement an enterprise shared services strategy to offer broader service-based capabilities instead of point solutions.</p>
<p>VA will support and enhance enterprise-wide information sharing through the implementation of a Customer Data Integration (CDI) environment to identify, develop, designate and enforce authoritative information sources and services.</p>
<p>VA will continue its efforts on the Ruthless Reduction Task Force (RRTF) to identify and eliminate redundancies within VA’s IT environment.</p>
<p>VA will implement its Unified Communications Strategy to further leverage common services and reduce its IT footprint through the convergence of our facility voice, contact center, video, audio conferencing, and collaboration environments into a single platform and operational model.</p>
<p>VA will accelerate the implementation of our wireless infrastructure.</p>
<p>VA will develop and implement strategies to support “bring your own device” and “use your own device” to support the increasingly mobile workforces and Veteran population.</p>
<p>VA will continue to implement and extend the Continuous Readiness in Information Security Program (CRISP) operating model, including security management, contingency planning, configuration management, segregation of duties, and access controls for protecting VA sensitive information.</p>
<p>VA will continue to implement the use of Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Only Authentication (POA) for access to VA computer systems as mandated by Federal identification standards (Homeland Security Presidential Directive [HSPD] -12).</p>
<p>VA will pursue cost-effective system modernization to enhance operational and management processes and improve oversight.</p>

<p>The size of the Veteran population may be decreasing, but the demographics and preferences are increasing in complexity. VA’s infrastructure – organizational structure, equipment, and facilities – must become more flexible and scalable in order to better serve Veterans of today and tomorrow.</p>
<p><em>Strategies</em>:</p>
<p>VA will rethink how it operates as a Department, defining the fundamental cross-cutting capabilities and interdependencies required to achieve them. We will identify and address any internal organizational, policy, procedural, perceptual, and cultural boundaries that constrain our ability to coordinate, integrate, and deliver benefits and services. VA will evaluate alternate organizational designs that improve integration of benefits and services to provide the client a coordinated experience when utilizing multiple benefits and services.</p>
<p>VA will explore opportunities for sharing facilities and services across VA and with other federal agencies; state, tribal, and local governments; nonprofits; and private industry to support Veterans and Veterans’ families.</p>
<p>VA will continue capital planning efforts to provide safe, secure, modern, and sustainable infrastructure, and enhance capital planning efforts that increase the flexibility of VA’s capital infrastructure to accommodate integration of services and promote sharing of physical and virtual space within and between VA and its partners.</p>
<p>VA will expand “connected” health benefits and services which may reduce our dependency on physical infrastructure.</p>

<p>VA will continue to be good a steward of its resources by closely monitoring agency travel to mission essential needs. We will continue working to decrease improper payments, recapture misallocated funds, and dispose of unnecessary real estate.</p>
<p>VA will improve the models and systems used to forecast and capture cost. We will adopt the direct tracking of people, equipment, and consumables. We will implement a modernized financial management system.</p>
<p>VA will continue to mature its capability based planning, programming, budgeting, and execution (PPBE) process to tie strategy to budget and budget to performance.</p>
<p>VA will continue to review its internal buying patterns and identify opportunities for strategic sourcing to achieve significant savings for recurring requirements.</p>
<p>VA will develop a strategic capital equipment planning model and a plan to improve medical equipment life cycle.</p>

VA must protect against and prepare to respond to as well as recover from all hazards to ensure the safety and security of Veterans and eligible beneficiaries, volunteers, employees, and visitors at VA facilities while integrating, improving, and increasing VA’s resilience through operational continuity and preparedness.</p>
<p>VA defines “readiness” as the ability to serve Veterans and eligible beneficiaries now and on a day-to-day routine basis, and “preparedness” as the ability to serve Veterans and eligible beneficiaries in times of crisis and to serve as a national asset to the Nation. These aspects of “readiness” and “preparedness” define the Department’s 4<sup>th</sup> Mission. The priorities of the 4<sup>th</sup> Mission include personnel accountability (e.g. Veterans and eligible beneficiaries, employees, contractors, and others on VA property); establishing and maintaining command, control, and communication; continuing to provide services to Veterans and eligible beneficiaries; and for VA to serve as a National asset following an emergency or disaster.</p>
<p><em>Strategies</em>:</p>
<p>VA will continue to develop and refine our Continuity Program in accordance with HSPD-20 – National Continuity Policy. Through the VA Comprehensive Emergency Management Program, VA will support DoD, DHS/Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and other Federal Departments and Agencies in support of Presidential Policy Directive-8 – National Preparedness. VA will utilize the VA Integrated Operations Center (VA IOC) in order to provide the Secretary a single office responsible for proactively collecting, coordinating, and analyzing information in order to make recommendations to VA leadership. VA will continue to develop a comprehensive Department Exercise, Training, and Evaluation Program in accordance with DHS National Exercise program.</p>
<p>VA will standardize the on-boarding, monitoring, and off-boarding process for VA employees, contractors, and affiliates. VA will fully implement HSPD-12 to include the Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card as the standard process for provisioning logical access to VA information systems (LACS) and standardize Physical Access Control Systems (PACS) to VA facilities to ensure the safety and security of Veterans and eligible beneficiaries, volunteers, employees, and visitors.</p>
<p>VA will evaluate and streamline vulnerability assessment programs of VA facilities to mitigate against natural and technological disasters and terrorist attacks. VA will establish a comprehensive Active Threat/Active Shooter Incident Response Program to maximize response success in any VA facility.</p>
<p>VA will develop and implement an Insider Threat program in accordance with Executive Order 13587 - Structural Reforms to Improve the Security of Classified Networks and the Responsible Sharing and Safeguarding of Classified Information in order to protect classified material in the VA.</p>

<p>Fulfilling our country’s commitment to Veterans, VA will deliver effective and easy customer experiences in which Veterans feel valued.</p>
<p>By September 30, 2017, reach 90% agreement with the statement “I trust VA to fulfill our country’s commitment to Veterans.”</p>
<p>Because this is a new measure, VA will establish the baseline in FY16 and add the measure to surveys covering all of VA’s primary services and product lines.</p>
</p>
                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>VA offers a remarkable array of services and benefits to Veterans and eligible dependents. But the experience is disjointed and inconsistent. There are hundreds of phone numbers and thousands of websites, each operating independently under different standards. Similarly, there are a wide array of VA and non-VA resources at the Federal, state, local, corporate, non-profit and tribal level that are not coherently organized or coordinated into a single source or reference point for the Veteran.  Veterans deserve better and so do VA staff, who care deeply about delivering the best possible outcome for Veterans.</p>
<p>The Veterans Experience team is leading a powerful new effort to improve customer experiences across VA, nationwide. Our goal: Fostering the delivery of effective and easy customer experiences in which Veterans feel valued. We are achieving this goal the same way the world’s most successful companies do: by listening to our customers – Veterans, their families and supporters – when they describe how they want things to work. Equally important, we are listening to our employees about obstacles to excellence on-the-job. Employee empowerment is an essential part of the equation. This is user-centered design. It puts Veterans and the employees who serve them front and center.</p>
<p>VA and the Veterans Experience team face a number of challenges and barriers:</p>
<ul><li>Siloed products and services without a common view of customers and their needs and wants.</li>
<li>Customer touchpoints and experiences owned by individual product and service teams, not integrated within a complementary suite of offerings.</li>
<li>Insular approach that does not account for the community resources used by customers.</li>
</ul><p>The APG will track our ability to overcome these barriers by implementing the strategies described in the next section.</p>
<p>To build trust among our customers, VA must consistently deliver customer experiences marked by effectiveness, ease, and engagement.<a href="http://www.performance.gov/node/62291/edit?add_indicator=#_ftn1">[1]</a> To ensure comparability across VA’s disparate service and product lines, the same measures of Trust and Customer Experience will be applied.</p>
<p><strong>Trust</strong></p>
<p>VA earns trust among Veterans by knowing them and showing that we care; by understanding and anticipating their needs; by providing fair benefits and timely services; by being there when they need us; and by keeping our promises. With every interaction, VA has the opportunity to deepen a trusting relationship with Veterans, or to diminish that trust.</p>
<p>Our Agency Priority Goal states: By September 30, 2017, VA will reach 90% agreement with the statement “I trust VA to fulfill our country’s commitment to Veterans.”</p>
<p>Timeline:</p>
<p>Q1 FY16:               Trust and Experience measures incorporated into existing customer experience surveys</p>
<p>Q2 FY16:               Baseline data collection begins</p>
<p>Q3 FY16:               Baseline measurement established; quarterly targets specified</p>
<p>Q4 FY 2016:          Publish quarterly update</p>
<p>Q1 FY 2017:          70 percent of VA customers surveyed ‘agree’ or ‘strongly agree’ with Trust  statement Customer Experience</p>
<p>Q2 FY 2017:          75 percent of VA customers surveyed ‘agree’ or ‘strongly agree’ with Trust statement Customer Experience</p>
<p>Q3 FY 2017:          80 percent of VA customers surveyed ‘agree’ or ‘strongly agree’ with Trust statement Customer Experience</p>
<p>Q4 FY17:               90% of VA customers surveyed ‘agree’ or ‘strongly agree’ with Trust statement</p>
<p><strong>Customer Experience</strong></p>
<p>Trust in VA is built one interaction at a time. The experience must be effective; it must be easy; and, ideally, it must be engaging and reflective of a valued, personal relationship with our customer. Trust is broken when VA does not consistently meet expectations in these three categories. VA will use customers’ ratings of their individual experiences as indicators of performance toward the overall Veterans Experience APG.</p>
<p>The measures will include level of agreement with questions such as:</p>
<ul><li>Effectiveness: “I got the service I needed.”</li>
<li>Ease: “It was easy to get the service I needed.”</li>
<li>Engagement: “I felt like a valued customer.”</li>
</ul><p>These measures are also new, and will be implemented along the timeline for the Trust measure indicated above. They will be added to new and existing VA customer experience surveys where responses will be correlated with operational data to highlight performance improvement opportunities that will improve Veterans experiences.</p>

<p>1) My supervisor provides me with constructive suggestions to improve my job performance.</p>
<p>2) In my work unit, steps are taken to deal with a poor performer who cannot or will not improve.</p>
<p>3) Employees have a feeling of personal empowerment with respect to work processes.</p>
<p>4) I feel encouraged to come up with new and better ways of doing things.</p>
<p>5) How satisfied are you with the information you receive from management on what's going on   in your organization?</p>
<p>6) My organization's leaders maintain high standards of honesty and integrity.</p>
</p>
                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>Leader and managerial actions can help boost job satisfaction and ultimately improve business outcomes.  Strong leaders are important to creating a positive organizational climate.  Employees who are regularly engaged with their leaders are more innovative than others, more likely to want to remain with their employer, absent less often, enjoy greater levels of personal well-being, and perceive their workload to be more sustainable than others.  Ultimately, our customer, the Veteran, will enjoy a higher level of satisfaction with VA services as a result of an improved Employee Experience.</p>
<p>VA is committed to creating a work environment which provides all employees with a more consistent, positive Employee Experience, which ultimately improves the Veteran’s experience with our organization.  Studies indicate that employees who are satisfied with leadership behaviors provide a higher level of positive responses on employee surveys.</p>
<p>To evaluate progress, VA will use six questions from the Federal Employment Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) to pulse VA employees on a quarterly basis about their experience with VA leaders.  The six questions were selected after a thorough review and assessment of what leadership behaviors can drive the biggest improvements in employee engagement and job satisfaction.</p>
<p>Transformational leaders engage in relationship-building and relationship maintaining behaviors with their employees.  Strong leaders tend to have the ability to motivate employees, establish trust, communicate goals, and generate commitment.  Changing an organization’s culture may take a decade or longer, especially with a large organization such as VA.  This APG, which covers only a two-year time period, focuses on a strategy that primarily addresses improving leadership practices, and that can bring about measurable changes in a relatively short period of time.</p>
<p>The leadership strategy in this APG is supported by myriad programs and activities including strategic communications which, over time, should lead to improved favorable responses to the six employee survey questions. The leadership strategy also supports the accomplishment of one of VA’s Strategic Objectives, “Make VA a Place People Want to Serve,” and VA’s MyVA Initiative.  Furthermore, it is one of the twelve VA “Breakthrough Priorities.”</p>
<p>VA realizes that it will take more than one program or initiative to improve the Employee Experience and/or change VA employees’ perceptions of its leaders.  Furthermore, analyzing employee survey results carries its own set of risks of misinterpretation.  However, overall, VA believes that participation in leadership programs and the subsequent implementation of leadership practices should have a significant positive impact on employee perceptions of leadership.</p>
<p>Potential barriers to improving the VA Employee Experience include:</p>
<ul><li>Lack of leader/employee engagement to execute improvement ideas</li>
<li>Resistance to change</li>
<li>Inadequate leader development, training and experience</li>
<li>Insufficient execution of communication strategies by leadership</li>

<p>In 2015, a congressionally-mandated Independent Assessment of VA Healthcare Capabilities<a href="http://www.performance.gov/node/73511/Edit#_ftn2">[2]</a> as well as an Institute of Medicine report<a href="http://www.performance.gov/node/73511/Edit#_ftn3">[3]</a> highlighted that VA access, while meeting timeliness standards <em>on average</em>, still had unacceptable levels of variation by site for specific services.   These independent reviews are candid in stating that highly specialized services required by Veterans are frequently not available in their communities even from private sector providers.  Those independent reports interviewed many of U.S. medicine’s thought leaders, and these experts highlighted the critical importance of addressing access challenges by taking a systems approach, and recommended strategies such as modeling system supply and demand relationships, exploring design and policy changes, and creating a culture of service excellence that empowers the front line to experiment, identify limitations, and learn from trials.</p>
<p>The ultimate success of these strategies and programs must be evaluated through the eyes of the Veteran, as a noticeable improvement in their self-reported ability to receive needed care.   Assessing access to health care through direct survey of patients is the only access measure currently endorsed by the National Quality Forum.   Using a survey-based approach to measure access also provides additional advantages, such as 1) ability to benchmark with private sector health systems and 2) avoiding the shortcomings of current VA scheduling software (a replacement scheduling system will not be in place until late 2017).</p>

                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>It is VA’s mission and responsibility to ensure Veterans receive the benefits and services they have earned accurately and within a reasonable amount of time.  Since FY 2009, VA’s Agency Priority Goal (APG) for improving access to benefits was focused on eliminating the backlog of disability claims, defined as the number of rating-related claims pending more than 125 days.  VA has made dramatic progress in reducing the backlog, improving the timeliness of decisions, and reducing the overall pending inventory of disability rating claims – while at the same time improving the quality of its decisions.  To achieve these service improvements, VA defined the requirement, transformed claims processing through implementation of streamlined processes and systems, and accordingly focused resources on achieving the goal.</p>
<p>Veterans who are awarded disability compensation at the 30-percent level or higher are entitled to additional compensation for their eligible dependents.  Approximately 70 percent of the 4.1 million Veterans currently receiving compensation are eligible for this additional benefit – nearly 45 percent more than those eligible for the same benefits just five years ago.  As the status of these Veterans’ dependents change (through marriage, divorce, death, birth or adoption of children, step-children, and school attendance for children over 18 years of age), adjustments must be made to Veterans’ compensation awards.  With VA’s record-levels of production of disability rating decisions (almost 1.4 million disability claims completed in FY15), more and more Veterans continue to be added to the compensation rolls.  The result was an inventory at the end of FY15 of almost 227,000 pending dependency claims that have been pending, on average, nearly a year.</p>
<p>Ensuring that Veterans receive timely and accurate claim decisions is paramount.  As VA continues to improve timeliness of disability claims decisions, VA will also focus on the dependency claims that are the direct result of the dramatic increase in completed disability rating decisions and growth in the number of Veterans receiving compensation at the higher disability evaluation levels.</p>

                               <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>VA has taken decisive action toward its goal of ending homelessness among Veterans.  The End Veteran Homelessness initiative is intended to prevent Veterans and their families from entering homelessness and to assist those who are homeless in exiting as safely and quickly as possible.  VA’s “no wrong door” philosophy will ensure that homeless and at risk for homeless Veterans have timely access to appropriate housing and services.  Any door a Veteran comes to - at a medical center, a regional office, or a community organization - will lead to the tools to offer Veteran assistance.  Ending homelessness among Veterans will advance the mission of VA by ensuring that all Veterans and their families achieve housing stability.<br />
On a single night in January 2014 during the Point in Time (PIT) Count <a href="http://c/Users/epbdmb/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.IE5/11GKRUOW/Homelessness%20APG%20(Feb_2014_Final_Update)%20kwh.docx#_ftn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, there were 49,933 homeless Veterans in the US.  Effectively ending homelessness among Veterans requires rapid access to permanent housing, health care, employment, benefits, and other supportive services.  VA works closely with community partners to meet current and new demands for any Veteran who is experiencing or is at imminent risk of homelessness.  Housing First and Rapid Re-housing are two of the many evidence-based approaches VA uses to end homelessness.  The Housing First model follows the philosophy of providing permanent housing as quickly as possible to Veterans/individuals experiencing homelessness and then wrapping health care and other supportive services as needed around the Veteran to sustain housing and improve their quality of life.  Rapid Re-housing is a set of strategies to help families quickly move out of homelessness and into permanent housing.  It typically involves:  housing search and landlord mediation assistance, short-term or flexible rental assistance, and transitional case management services.  Rapid Re-housing provides crisis intervention services to quickly place an individual or family who is currently homeless into a permanent, sustainable housing situation.</p>
