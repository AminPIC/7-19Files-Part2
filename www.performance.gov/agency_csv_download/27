"General Services Administration","023","GSA","The mission of GSA is to deliver the best value in real estate, acquisition, and technology services to government and the American people.
","GSA has an annual business volume of over $60 billion, manages over 205 thousand fleet vehicles, and manages a building portfolio, which includes 9,011 owned or leased assets, more than 378 million rentable square feet of workspace, and 471 historic properties. We have a continuing commitment to our federal customers and the American public to provide services in the most cost-effective manner possible, and we deliver on this promise by steadily improving organizational performance. At a time when budgets are shrinking across the federal government, we are providing the value that our partner agencies need so that they can focus their resources on fulfilling their own important missions to the American people.
","GSA engaged key stakeholders in the development of this plan. These stakeholders include customers, suppliers, executive councils, and the Office of Management and Budget. Both federal and non-federal stakeholders were consulted when developing and formulating goals. Through activities like the Top to Bottom Review, the Great Ideas Hunt, and numerous town hall meetings, people at every level of GSA provided input about how we can be more efficient and effective. We conducted strategic visioning sessions, which included external stakeholders to define the future state of the agency, and published our draft Strategic Plan on our website and requested comments from stakeholders: including Congressional stakeholders and the American public. All comments received were considered when finalizing this plan and updating our internal processes for planning and performance management.
