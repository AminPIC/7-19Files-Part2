                <p><strong>Problem or opportunity being addressed</strong></p>
<p>The future of the Nation’s natural, cultural and historic heritage depends on the next generation of active stewards.  The Millennial generation, defined as individuals born in 1980 or later, is larger, more urban and diverse than any generation in our history.  Yet Millennials have grown up more disconnected from the natural world.  As Secretary Sally Jewell has said, “Engaging the Millennial generation in service on public lands, welcoming them into the Department of the Interior, and so many other opportunities to have work within public lands management, is going to be a critical part of our future, if we care about these special places that help define us.”</p>
<p><strong>Secretary Sally Jewell, March 14, 2014 – Announcing the Next Generation Priority</strong>            <a href="http://www.doi.gov/youth/news/engaging-the-next-generation.cfm" target="_blank"><strong>http://www.doi.gov/youth/news/engaging-the-next-generation.cfm</strong></a></p>
<p>Interior's Engaging the Next Generation priority goal seeks to establish meaningful and deep connections between young people from every background and every community to the great outdoors.  Interior is working to inspire millions of young people to play, learn, serve and work outdoors, and aims to provide 100,000 work and training opportunities over four years to individuals up to the age of 35.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives</strong></p>
<p>This priority goal supports Mission Area 4, “Engaging the Next Generation,” of the Department of the Interior’s FY 2014-2018 Strategic Plan, as well as efforts to create a 21<sup>st</sup> Century Workforce.  Interior benefits from a workforce that is passionate about the mission, dedicated to public service, and highly skilled and knowledgeable.  Across Interior, 40% of our permanent workforce will be eligible to retire within the next five years.  As part of our succession planning, a variety of work and training opportunities to next generation students and recent graduates are provided.  Interior’s goal of engaging youth in conservation includes programs to encourage the nation’s youth to play, learn, serve, and work in the great outdoors. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Key barriers and challenges </strong></p>
<p>By and through its partners, Interior must provide work and training opportunities within a specific time-frame for seasonal and temporary summer employment.  If bureaus miss the window of opportunity during the limited time-frame, participants may seek employment opportunities elsewhere.  Additionally, with approximately one-third of Interior youth employment stemming from partnership agreements, our ability to enter into partnership agreements is essential, particularly for the peak hiring seasons when colleges are out of session.  These public/private partnership efforts help to leverage Federal dollars, in some cases by a 3 to 1 ratio, and assist Interior in increasing youth employment opportunities. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong></p>
<p>Interior partners with the Corps Network, which engages 30,000 young people in all 50 States, in addition to the Public Lands Service Coalition.  Also, Interior partners with non-profit, corporate, state, local and tribal entities to enhance volunteer service opportunities and youth employment in the great outdoors.  Interior will continue to engage these stakeholders in implementing broader youth stewardship and engagement. </p>

                <p>Interior works with partners under the authorities of the Public Land Corps and Youth Conservation Corps Acts to involve youth and Millennials ages 15 to 35.  Additionally, the Youth in the Great Outdoors Initiative places a special emphasis on engaging youth from communities with historically lower participation rates, as well as young women and girls, in our programs.  Further information on related activities can be found at: <a href="https://www.doi.gov/youth/">https://www.doi.gov/youth/</a>.  </p>

            <h2>Progress Update</h2>
            <div>
                <p>In the fourth quarter of FY 2016, an additional 8,199 new permanent, temporary and seasonal hires, and new partnership opportunities for individuals between 15-35 years of age were added to the FY2014-2016 total for a cumulative total of 76,344 next generation employment and training opportunities.  Approximately one-third of the Department's youth employment stems from partnership agreements.  Our ability to enter into partnership agreements is essential, particularly for the peak hiring seasons when colleges are out of session. These employment opportunities, which help to leverage Federal dollars, in some cases by a 3 to 1 ratio and assist Interior in increasing youth employment opportunities, are typically expected in the third and fourth quarters of FY 2016, during the warmer months that are more conducive to outdoor activities and school is out of session.</p>

            <div>
                <p>The Department will leverage collaboration with the Partnership for Public Service, OPM and other partners to promote Pathways Internships and other employment opportunities for millennials. The Department is also building capacity to improve millennial employment through Hiring Excellence Workshops which discuss hiring flexibilities regarding youth employment, and partnering with Peace Corps to recruit returning Peace Corps Volunteers.

<p><strong>Data Accuracy and Reliability</strong></p>
<p>The Department ensures the accuracy and reliability of the performance data in measuring progress towards its Agency Priority Goals, in accordance with the five data quality specifications in the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 for:</p>
<ul><li><u>Means used to verify and validate measured values</u>: All performance data reported on <a href="http://www.performance.gov/ by">http://www.performance.gov/ by</a> the Department is subject to the data verification and validation standards initially published in 2003 and reissued in 2007 (see <a href="https://www.doi.gov/performance/data-validation-and-verification">https://www.doi.gov/performance/data-validation-and-verification</a>).  Implementing organization heads or chief officials confirm in writing the validity of the data.  In the case of Agency Priority (Performance) Goals, senior officials in the implementing organization personally present the data on a quarterly basis to the senior Departmental leadership.</li>
</ul><ul><li><u>Sources for the data</u>: In response to data calls, the Department’s human resources office provides employment data on millennials (ages 15-35) from the Department’s personnel system to ensure a consistent data collection methodology.  Additionally, bureaus report employment through partnerships so that total employment can be tracked and analyzed each quarter.  This data is collected, reviewed, integrated, and maintained by the Department’s Office of Planning and Performance Management on the <a href="../index.html">www.performance.gov</a> website.</li>
</ul><ul><li><u>Level of accuracy required for the intended use of the data</u>: Performance data is used for management purposes, as a representative indicator of progress in relation to a target or goal established by the corresponding implementing organization.  The accuracy of the data is that which is considered necessary to provide a reasonable representation of the progress made relative to a target or goal for discussion purposes, so as to help:
<ul><li>determine if the progress is considered adequate</li>
<li>provide understanding of the ability for the processes and methods being implemented to achieve the goal</li>
<li>indicate if any further exploration or evaluation is needed to better ensure achievement of the goal; and</li>
<li> whether alternative action, including adjusting funding levels, facilities, workforce, IT capabilities, etc., is needed to help better ensure achievement of  the goal.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><ul><li><u>Limitations to the data at the required level of accuracy</u>: Performance data is subject to potential errors from: the use of estimations and extrapolations, especially where direct measurement is impractical and/or considered too costly; individual observation; miscommunication; and/or failure to effectively employ the guidance described in the  “Indicator” description in <a href="../index.html">http://www.performance.gov/</a>. However, based on multiple review levels and accuracy certifications, we do not believe these limitations to be significant.</li>
</ul><ul><li><u>How the agency has compensated for such limitations if needed to reach the required level of accuracy</u>: Along with the implementing organization’s official assurance of faithfully employing the data verification and validation standards, submitted data is reviewed within the context of the scope and nature of the activity, plans, and past experience to help confirm accuracy.  Following review and verification by the submitting bureau or office, the data is reviewed within its corresponding trends and programmatic context by the Department’s Office of Planning and Performance Management to determine if further consultation with the data provider is necessary to adjust or correct the reported data before publication. Senior management and leadership consider this level of accuracy to be acceptable in their use of the data.  Past experience in using the data, historical trend and programmatic context assessments, and bureau data quality certifications indicate that the limitations are considered minor and compensating measures are not considered necessary.</li>
</ul><p>In addition to employing the Department’s data validation and verification standards, and internal reviews of submitted data, the best “test” of the data’s accuracy is in its use.  Agency Priority (Performance) Goal data is reviewed during quarterly status reviews where senior officials report their data directly to the Department’s senior leadership and is made publicly available through <a href="../index.html">http://www.performance.gov/</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Data Accuracy and Reliability</strong></p>
<p>The Department ensures the accuracy and reliability of the performance data in measuring progress towards its Agency Priority Goals, in accordance with the five data quality specifications in the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 for:</p>
<ul><li><u>Means used to verify and validate measured values</u>: All performance data reported on <a href="http://www.performance.gov/ by">http://www.performance.gov/ by</a> the Department is subject to the data verification and validation standards initially published in 2003 and reissued in 2007 (see <a href="https://www.doi.gov/performance/data-validation-and-verification">https://www.doi.gov/performance/data-validation-and-verification</a>).  Implementing organization heads or chief officials confirm in writing the validity of the data.  In the case of Agency Priority (Performance) Goals, senior officials in the implementing organization personally present the data on a quarterly basis to the senior Departmental leadership.</li>
</ul><ul><li><u>Sources for the data</u>: In response to data calls, the Department’s human resources office provides employment data on millennials (ages 15-35) from the Department’s personnel system to ensure a consistent data collection methodology.  Additionally, bureaus report employment through partnerships so that total employment can be tracked and analyzed each quarter.  This data is collected, reviewed, integrated, and maintained by the Department’s Office of Planning and Performance Management on the <a href="../index.html">www.performance.gov</a> website.</li>
</ul><ul><li><u>Level of accuracy required for the intended use of the data</u>: Performance data is used for management purposes, as a representative indicator of progress in relation to a target or goal established by the corresponding implementing organization.  The accuracy of the data is that which is considered necessary to provide a reasonable representation of the progress made relative to a target or goal for discussion purposes, so as to help:
<ul><li>determine if the progress is considered adequate</li>
<li>provide understanding of the ability for the processes and methods being implemented to achieve the goal</li>
<li>indicate if any further exploration or evaluation is needed to better ensure achievement of the goal; and</li>
<li> whether alternative action, including adjusting funding levels, facilities, workforce, IT capabilities, etc., is needed to help better ensure achievement of  the goal.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><ul><li><u>Limitations to the data at the required level of accuracy</u>: Performance data is subject to potential errors from: the use of estimations and extrapolations, especially where direct measurement is impractical and/or considered too costly; individual observation; miscommunication; and/or failure to effectively employ the guidance described in the  “Indicator” description in <a href="../index.html">http://www.performance.gov/</a>. However, based on multiple review levels and accuracy certifications, we do not believe these limitations to be significant.</li>
</ul><ul><li><u>How the agency has compensated for such limitations if needed to reach the required level of accuracy</u>: Along with the implementing organization’s official assurance of faithfully employing the data verification and validation standards, submitted data is reviewed within the context of the scope and nature of the activity, plans, and past experience to help confirm accuracy.  Following review and verification by the submitting bureau or office, the data is reviewed within its corresponding trends and programmatic context by the Department’s Office of Planning and Performance Management to determine if further consultation with the data provider is necessary to adjust or correct the reported data before publication. Senior management and leadership consider this level of accuracy to be acceptable in their use of the data.  Past experience in using the data, historical trend and programmatic context assessments, and bureau data quality certifications indicate that the limitations are considered minor and compensating measures are not considered necessary.</li>
</ul><p>In addition to employing the Department’s data validation and verification standards, and internal reviews of submitted data, the best “test” of the data’s accuracy is in its use.  Agency Priority (Performance) Goal data is reviewed during quarterly status reviews where senior officials report their data directly to the Department’s senior leadership and is made publicly available through <a href="../index.html">http://www.performance.gov/</a>.</p>

</p>
                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p><strong>a.  Problem or opportunity being addressed</strong></p>
<p>The future of the Country’s natural, cultural and historic heritage depends on the next generation of active stewards.  The Millennial generation, defined as individuals born in 1980 or later, is larger, more urban and diverse than any generation in our history.  Yet Millennials have grown up more disconnected from the natural world.  As Secretary Sally Jewell indicated,  “Engaging the millennial generation in service on public lands, welcoming them into the Department of the Interior, and so many other opportunities to have work within public lands management, is going to be a critical part of our future, if we care about these special places that help define us.”</p>
<p><strong>Secretary Sally Jewell, March 14, 2014 – Announcing the Next Generation Priority</strong>            <a href="http://www.doi.gov/youth/news/engaging-the-next-generation.cfm" target="_blank"><strong>http://www.doi.gov/youth/news/engaging-the-next-generation.cfm</strong></a></p>
<p>The underlying objective of Interior's Engaging the Next Generation priority is to establish meaningful and deep connections between young people from every background and every community to the great outdoors. Interior is investing millions of dollars in our <em>Engaging the Next Generation</em> priority to inspire millions of young people to play, learn, serve and work outdoors.  To that end, Interior has established a goal of providing 100,000 work and training opportunities over four years to individuals up to the age of 35.   In support of this long-term goal, the FY 2014-FY 2015 priority goal is being extended to include ages 15-35 in providing 40,000 work and training opportunity over the two year period, starting in FY 2015. </p>
<p>This priority goal complements Interior’s efforts to develop a 21<sup>st</sup> Century Workforce.  The Department benefits from a workforce that is passionate about the mission, dedicated to public service, and highly skilled and knowledgeable.  Across Interior, 40% of our permanent workforce will be eligible to retire within the next five years.   Providing a variety of work and training opportunities to students and recent graduates is critical to our succession planning. </p>
<p><strong>b.  Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives</strong></p>
<p>This priority goal supports Strategic Plan mission area 4, “Engaging the Next Generation” as well as efforts to create a 21<sup>st</sup> Century Workforce.  The priority goal aims to address reductions in work and training opportunities created by fiscal challenges in FY 2013 and builds upon the number of opportunities provided in FY 2010-FY 2012. </p>
<p>This priority goal for work and training opportunities builds upon other Engaging the Next Generation initiatives at DOI.  The Department’s goal of engaging youth in conservation includes programs to encourage the nation’s youth to play, learn, serve, and work in the great outdoors.  As the culmination of this four pronged approach, work and training opportunities for youth depend in great part on successful efforts to promote recreation on DOI-managed public lands, encourage the nation’s educators to bring our natural environment into classrooms, and cultivate a culture of service in support of conservation and natural resource management.</p>
<p><strong>c.  Key barriers and challenges </strong></p>
<p>Work and training opportunities, both directly by the Department and through partners, must occur within a specific time-frame for seasonal and temporary summer employment in order to secure commitments from participants.  If bureaus miss the window of opportunity during the limited time-frame, participants may seek employment opportunities elsewhere.  Additionally, with approximately one-third of DOI youth employment stemming from partnership agreements, budget uncertainty creates significant challenges to Bureaus’ ability to enter into partnership agreements, particularly for the peak hiring seasons when colleges are out of session.  These public/private partnership efforts help to leverage Federal dollars, in some cases by a 3 to 1 ratio, and assist the Department in increasing youth employment opportunities.</p>
<p>In FY 2013, fiscal and budgetary challenges significantly impacted the Department’s ability to fund work and training opportunities for youth.  Furthermore, the timing of the budgetary uncertainty, as well as the implementation of new models of youth employment across the government, via the Pathways program, made timely hiring of youth for those available positions difficult.  Should current budgetary and fiscal trends continue, the Department expects these to pose a barrier to fulfillment of this goal.</p>
<p><strong>d.  Stakeholder Engagement</strong></p>
<p>Key partners include the over 150 members of the Corps Network that engage 30,000 young people in all 50 States in addition to the work of the Public Lands Service Coalition.  These public/private partnership efforts help to leverage Federal dollars in some cases 3 to 1 and have assisted the Departments in increasing youth employment opportunities.  In addition, there are many non-profit, corporate, state, local and tribal entities that partner with the Department to enhance volunteer service opportunities and youth employment in the great outdoors. It will continue to be important to engage these stakeholders as we implement related recommendations for the broader youth stewardship and engagement priority goal.</p>

<p>The future of the Country’s natural, cultural and historic heritage depends on the next generation of active stewards.  The Millennial generation, defined as individuals born in 1980 or later, is larger, more urban and diverse than any generation in our history.  Yet Millennials have grown up more disconnected from the natural world.  As Secretary Sally Jewell indicated,  “Engaging the millennial generation in service on public lands, welcoming them into the Department of the Interior, and so many other opportunities to have work within public lands management, is going to be a critical part of our future, if we care about these special places that help define us.”</p>
<p><strong>Secretary Sally Jewell, March 14, 2014 – Announcing the Next Generation Priority</strong>            <a href="http://www.doi.gov/youth/news/engaging-the-next-generation.cfm" target="_blank"><strong>http://www.doi.gov/youth/news/engaging-the-next-generation.cfm</strong></a></p>
<p>The underlying objective of Interior's Engaging the Next Generation priority is to establish meaningful and deep connections between young people from every background and every community to the great outdoors. Interior is investing millions of dollars in our <em>Engaging the Next Generation</em> priority to inspire millions of young people to play, learn, serve and work outdoors.  To that end, Interior has established a goal of providing 100,000 work and training opportunities over four years to individuals up to the age of 35.   In support of this long-term goal, the FY 2014-FY 2015 priority goal is being extended to include ages 15-35 in providing 40,000 work and training opportunity over the two year period, starting in FY 2015. </p>
<p>This priority goal complements Interior’s efforts to develop a 21<sup>st</sup> Century Workforce.  The Department benefits from a workforce that is passionate about the mission, dedicated to public service, and highly skilled and knowledgeable.  Across Interior, 40% of our permanent workforce will be eligible to retire within the next five years.   Providing a variety of work and training opportunities to students and recent graduates is critical to our succession planning. </p>
<p><strong>b.  Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives</strong></p>
<p>This priority goal supports Strategic Plan mission area 4, “Engaging the Next Generation” as well as efforts to create a 21<sup>st</sup> Century Workforce.  The priority goal aims to address reductions in work and training opportunities created by fiscal challenges in FY 2013 and builds upon the number of opportunities provided in FY 2010-FY 2012. </p>
<p>This priority goal for work and training opportunities builds upon other Engaging the Next Generation initiatives at DOI.  The Department’s goal of engaging youth in conservation includes programs to encourage the nation’s youth to play, learn, serve, and work in the great outdoors.  As the culmination of this four pronged approach, work and training opportunities for youth depend in great part on successful efforts to promote recreation on DOI-managed public lands, encourage the nation’s educators to bring our natural environment into classrooms, and cultivate a culture of service in support of conservation and natural resource management.</p>
<p><strong>c.  Key barriers and challenges </strong></p>
<p>Work and training opportunities, both directly by the Department and through partners, must occur within a specific time-frame for seasonal and temporary summer employment in order to secure commitments from participants.  If bureaus miss the window of opportunity during the limited time-frame, participants may seek employment opportunities elsewhere.  Additionally, with approximately one-third of DOI youth employment stemming from partnership agreements, budget uncertainty creates significant challenges to Bureaus’ ability to enter into partnership agreements, particularly for the peak hiring seasons when colleges are out of session.  These public/private partnership efforts help to leverage Federal dollars, in some cases by a 3 to 1 ratio, and assist the Department in increasing youth employment opportunities.</p>
<p>In FY 2013, fiscal and budgetary challenges significantly impacted the Department’s ability to fund work and training opportunities for youth.  Furthermore, the timing of the budgetary uncertainty, as well as the implementation of new models of youth employment across the government, via the Pathways program, made timely hiring of youth for those available positions difficult.  Should current budgetary and fiscal trends continue, the Department expects these to pose a barrier to fulfillment of this goal.</p>
<p><strong>d.  Stakeholder Engagement</strong></p>
<p>Key partners include the over 150 members of the Corps Network that engage 30,000 young people in all 50 States in addition to the work of the Public Lands Service Coalition.  These public/private partnership efforts help to leverage Federal dollars in some cases 3 to 1 and have assisted the Departments in increasing youth employment opportunities.  In addition, there are many non-profit, corporate, state, local and tribal entities that partner with the Department to enhance volunteer service opportunities and youth employment in the great outdoors. It will continue to be important to engage these stakeholders as we implement related recommendations for the broader youth stewardship and engagement priority goal.</p>
