                <p>Aviation fatality rates are at historic lows and continue to drop over time.  However, FAA recognizes the need to continue addressing precursors to accidents in order to continue to improve the current level of safety in the national airspace.</p>
<p>In the past, the FAA focused on actual incidents and accidents to identify risk within the aviation system.  The number of accidents has now dropped to a level in which this is a more difficult activity.  The FAA has now developed a proactive approach to identify and address risk.  This is done through dramatically increased air traffic data collection, improved analysis, and the implementation of safety mitigations put in place before an accident occurs.</p>

<p><strong>Runway Incursions (Categories  A&amp;B):</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the FAA’s Runway Safety Focus Airport program, the FAA is continuing to enhance the Local Runway Safety Action Team support model for all airport stakeholders.  The effort has been improved with increased support by the Runway Safety Group to reach 100 percent of FAA air traffic facilities.</p>
<p>FAA has initiated significant changes to core pilot education, training, testing and checking requirements.  Pilot Training Handbooks, the educational foundation for a pilot’s knowledge, were updated to reflect an increased emphasis on runway safety.  The Practical Test Standards, the guide examiners use to test applicants for pilot certificates, was revised to reflect a greater emphasis on runway safety.  A Remedial Training National Standardized Lesson Plan for pilots involved in runway incursions is being implemented.</p>
<p>The Air Traffic Organization’s Safety and Technical Training service unit continues to include runway safety topics in the mandatory, semi-annual Recurrent Training curricula that reach all FAA air traffic controllers.  Topics include:</p>
<ul><li>August 16, 2013: Runway Incursion Prevention with focus on tower scanning.</li>
<li>January 1, 2014: Runway Incursion Prevention with a focus on situational awareness, drift and distractions.
<ul><li>July 1, 2014: Runway Incursion Prevention with focus on hearback and readback error prevention, high energy runway crossings, managing landing operations and aircraft performance.</li>
<li>January 1, 2015:  Runway Incursion Prevention with a focus on the risks related to using runways as taxiways.</li>

            <h2>Progress Update</h2>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Commercial Air Carrier Fatality Rate: Progress update</strong>:</p>
<p>For the fourth quarter of FY15, the Commercial Air Carrier Fatality Rate is green. As of September 30, 2015 that rate was 0.1 versus a not-to-exceed (NTE) rate of 6.9 fatalities per 100 million persons on board. This equates to 1 actual fatality versus a not-to-exceed total number of fatalities of <strong>57 </strong>for the year. There have been 0 Part 121 fatal accidents for FY2015 and 1 Part 135 (commuter) fatal accidents with 1 fatality for the year. <strong>Based on current data and analysis of preliminary data, the FAA met the target for FY15.</strong></p>
<p>The FAA continues to work with aviation industry stakeholders to establish and implement safety management systems to address and reduce risk within their operations and the NAS. The FAA also has several prominent rulemaking projects that respond to changes identified during the investigation of the fatal Colgan Air accident in 2009 and helicopter air ambulance operations. Our commercial safety record indicates the agency has successfully addressed the majority of known system hazards contributing to accidents or incidents. As we develop and deploy NextGen systems, the increased degree of complexity will require improved analytical methods and tools for evaluating the safety risks within this area of operation. The FAA works with aviation industry stakeholders to establish safety management systems within their operations. With these systems in place, the FAA and the aviation industry will work together to address risks. The Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST) is a joint industry/government group committed to improving aviation safety, focusing on detecting risk and implementing mitigation strategies before accidents or serious incidents occur. CAST has developed multiple safety enhancements and continues achieve positive results. The latest enhancements were based on the FAA’s pillar of Risk-Based Decision Making (RBDM) analysis of non-accident data, demonstrating the agency’s evolution from reactive safety enhancements to proactive risk mitigation and elimination.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>General Aviation Fatal Accident Rate:</strong></p>
<p>For the fourth quarter of FY15, the General Aviation fatal accident rate is 1.03. As of September 30, 2015 the rate was <strong>1.03 </strong>versus a not-to-exceed (NTE) of 1.04 per 100,000 flight hours. This equates to 238 actual fatal accidents vs. a not-to-exceed of 239 for the quarter.  Additionally, there were <strong>384 </strong>total fatalities for FY15. The General Aviation fatal accident not-to-exceed (NTE) target is based on estimates of flight hours at this time.</p>
<p>The FAA is working with industry to help reduce the GA accident rate. The General Aviation Joint Steering Committee (GAJSC) continues to take a data-driven approach to understand fatal accident causes and contributing factors. This government-industry group meets to review GA accident trends, establish areas for special emphasis, and share information. The GAJSC has developed 29 safety enhancements to address the number one cause of fatal accidents, which is loss of control during approach and landing.  In FY2015, GAJSC focused on the analysis of accidents related to system component and power plant failure. To date, 4 safety enhancements have been approved by the GAJSC in that focus area. In addition to the GAJSC, the FAA Administrator met with GA leaders from the general aviation community to agree on actions to enhance safety and reduce accidents, specifically in the area of in-flight loss of control. This meeting increased the awareness of the accident rate and requested that the industry carry the safety message to the general aviation community.  Finally, the FAA and industry launched the ‘Fly Safe’ national safety campaign to educate the GA community on how to prevent loss of control accidents.  Each month the campaign delivers focused messages highlighting key solutions to prevent loss of control based on technology, policies, training, and equipment.</p>

<p><strong>Runway Incursions (Categories A &amp; B):</strong></p>
<p>Through the end of September 2015, the preliminary cumulative rate for category A &amp; B runway incursions is 0.302 per million operations, which equates to less than one event per 2 million operations.  This rate is only slightly elevated when compared to the rate for the same time period last fiscal year and remains below our target rate of 0.395 per million operations.</p>
<p>The FAA, using risk-based decision-making principals, is drawing on safety data to identify <em>Runway Safety Focus Airports </em>where the Agency can pursue runway safety improvements. The program identifies airports that require focused attention based on risk indicators such as runway incursions, excursions, plus potential or latent risk indicators such as airport design, management and operational changes. </p>
<p>The target for Runway Incursion (RI) Rate (Category A and B) is 0.395 per million operations. The September status is Green. Through September FY 2015, the preliminary cumulative rate for category A&amp;B runway incursions is 0.302 per million operations. The revised cumulative rate for August is 0.308. Preliminary data indicates that this target has been achieved. DATA ARE PRELIMINARY AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE. DATA CURRENT AS 10/1/2015"</p>

Results are considered final when all those accidents have been reported in the NTSB press release published by March. FY 2012 results will therefore be final after the 2014 press release. In general, however, fatal and serious injury accident numbers are not likely to change significantly between the end of the fiscal year and the date they are finalized.</p>

<p>The increase in both total runway incursions and Category A &amp; B runway incursions from FY 2011 through FY 2012 coincides with a similar increase in the number of reported airborne operational incidents and correlates to improvements in reporting systems and several years of safety culture enhancements that encourage FAA employees to actively participate in the ATO Safety Management System.  Though in FY 2013 the program metrics have greatly improved, the FAA remains committed to identifying and addressing safety risks in the National Aerospace System through improved reporting and analysis of data.</p>

Surface event reports are reviewed on a daily basis to determine if the incident meets the definition of a runway incursion.  Runway incursions are a subset of the incident data collected and the completeness of the data is based on the reporting requirements and completeness for each of the incident types.  If the operations data are not up to date, these calculations must be revised. The rate may also need to be recalculated if runway incursions are reported late. Historical volume data have been changed over the last three years, resulting in adjustments to current baselines.</p>

                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>In 2011, 34,414 people died and more than 2.2 million people were injured in transportation-related crashes and accidents, according to U.S. DOT national Transportation Statistics.  Motor vehicle crashes caused 32,367 fatalities, or 94 percent of the total, even though the rate of fatalities per hundred million miles of travel was the lowest ever recorded in the United States.  Distracted driving was a contributing factor in at least 3,331 fatal crashes.  Another 1, 213 people died in rail, air, and transit accidents.  We will use our safety programs and regulations for automobiles, airplanes, railroads, trucks, motorcoaches, pipelines, and hazardous materials as effectively as possible to reduce crashes, fatalities, and injuries, and will expand safety oversight to public transit.  We will continue to direct federal resources to address the most serious safety risks and implement program reforms that will advance our safety mission. Between 2001 and 2010, an average of 13 people in the United States died every year in incidents related to the transportation of hazardous material—a rate of one death for every 21 billion ton-miles of hazardous material moved.  In addition to causing deaths and injuries, hazardous material transportation incidents disrupt communities when people are evacuated from their homes, business activity is curtailed, and transportation services are interrupted.  We will continue to develop and encourage the use of safety tools - such as improved data collection, risk management practices, and incident response planning - to prevent, mitigate, and respond to hazardous material transportation accidents.</p>

</p>
                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>Background:</p>
<p>Reducing roadway fatalities continues to be a top priority at the Department of Transportation (DOT).  Roadway crashes are among the leading causes of death in the United States, especially among young people. Over the past 10 years, there has been a 25 percent reduction in the number of fatalities on the Nation’s roadways. In 2014, there were a projected 32,675 motor vehicle fatalities. This decline in fatalities shows a continuation in the general trend downward in fatalities that started in 2006.  In fact, the projected 2014 fatality rate of 1.08 per 100 vehicle million miles traveled (VMT) is the lowest ever recorded.</p>
<p>The importance of improving transportation safety is reflected in DOT’s Strategic Plan. The Department strives to make the U.S. transportation system the safest in the world. DOT will work with all of its stakeholders — transportation agencies, elected officials, law enforcement, industry, safety advocates, novice drivers, the disability and older adult communities, and the public — to reduce transportation-related fatalities and injuries and make our roadway system safe for all users.</p>
<p>Progress toward a national roadway safety goal requires collaboration with a diverse group of stakeholders and partners across a range of disciplines.  Within DOT, the relevant operating administrations can leverage the respective resources and expertise to more effectively achieve a safer transportation environment. These organizations include the following:</p>
<ul><li>Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) provides Federal State and local partners the tools, resources, and information necessary to make sound safety investment decisions and coordinates with States to develop Strategic Highway Safety Plans (SHSP) and implement programs that improve the safety of roadway infrastructure on all public roads.</li>
<li>Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) promotes safe commercial motor vehicle (CMV) (large truck and bus) operations through education, innovation, regulation, enforcement, financial assistance, partnerships, and full accountability to reduce crashes, injuries, and fatalities on our Nation’s roadways involving CMVs.</li>
<li>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) develops vehicle safety standards, conducts research on new vehicle safety and technology, and oversees compliance, defect investigations and recalls.  NHTSA equally focuses on driver behavior by developing effective traffic safety programs, providing grant funds to States to implement these programs, and implementing national high visibility enforcement campaigns.</li>
</ul><p>Roadway fatalities impact all road users, including drivers, passengers, pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclists, commercial vehicle operators, and those who work to build and maintain the Nation’s four million miles of roadways. The  Federal government is the only entity that has the authority to establish national safety standards for vehicles, regulate interstate motor carriers, and mandate roadway safety features.</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholders:</strong></p>
<p>FHWA, FMCSA, and NHTSA have formed strategic alliances with partners from a wide array of backgrounds to enhance and forward the Nation’s roadway safety agenda through guidance, technical assistance, and development of resource materials. Many stakeholders currently address transportation safety issues independently, through individual goals, plans, and activities. Some have implemented substantial safety initiatives, and these contributions are vital to maintaining and improving roadway safety. As described in the RSP, involvement by multiple stakeholders provides opportunities for broader public outreach and for the development and implementation of cross-cutting roadway safety strategies reflecting the common interests of many parties.</p>
<p>Each partner offers unique strengths and abilities to assist each mode to deliver its programs and leverage resources in protecting the public on the Nation’s roadways.  Progress toward a national roadway safety goal requires collaboration with a diverse group of stakeholders and partners across a range of disciplines.  The agencies within DOT work with a network of partner organizations, such as State Highway Safety Offices, State transportation departments, Tribal governments, local and county traffic engineers, law enforcement agencies, public health associations, safety advocacy groups, the motorcoach industry, hazardous shipping businesses, interstate trucking operations and the auto industry on the development of evidence-based roadway safety programs, projects, and safety standards.  Such collaboration will help to integrate a broad range of factors affecting roadway safety and create more efficient and effective problem-solving synergies across the transportation industry.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<p>A number of challenges could slow down or even reverse positive trends.  Many States continue to face budget shortfalls and are under tremendous pressure to reduce services, resulting in cut backs to roadway safety programs.  Cutbacks in State, Tribal and local law enforcement agency budgets could weaken national enforcement campaigns and local traffic safety enforcement efforts.  States, Tribes, and local governments must be willing to use data-driven analytical processes to make the best and most effective safety investments.</p>
<p>Distracted driving has emerged as a new threat over the past few years as the rise of portable electronic devices has swiftly expanded.   Moreover, as in-vehicle electronic systems become ever more sophisticated and complex, distracted driving could become an even greater threat if it is not addressed in a manner keeping pace with technological advancements.  In fact, a new report by the Governors' Highway Safety Association (GHSA) cites 50 percent of the US adult population now owning smartphones and the wireless industry reports a subscription penetration rate of 102.2 percent (^1).  Also, as the economy continues to gain momentum, more recreational travel and driving may lead to higher crash rates.  Additionally, safety defects in vehicles that are not addressed in a safe and efficiently manner can lead toward more serious vehicle crashes and injuries.  Finally, the repeal of proven life-saving traffic safety laws at the State level, such as universal motorcycle helmet or primary seat belt laws, could also result in higher injuries and fatalities.  Nevertheless, significant opportunities remain for continued progress in reducing roadway fatalities.  The Department will seek new and innovative ways to serve the American people and keep our roadways safe.</p>
<p>MAP-21, The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (P.L 112-141), was signed into law by President Obama on July 6, 2012.  MAP-21 provides an increase in safety funds available for the Highway Safety Improvement Program along with a focus on performance-based programming.  Implementation of MAP-21 will rely heavily on increased partnership across State agencies with DOT.  Additionally, the shift to performance-based programming may require additional effort on the part of some States.  There are also challenges associated with improving safety with local roads and local agencies with Federal-aid program funds, as well as the capacity and willingness of States to use data-driven and analytical processes to make the best safety infrastructure investments.</p>

By 2050, the U.S. population will likely increase by more than 100 million people. Highway and airport congestion are increasing, with related severe economic and environmental impacts. To address these challenges and strengthen the country’s competitive position in an increasingly global economy, the U.S. Department of Transportation has a comprehensive program to develop high-speed and intercity passenger rail. The Federal Railroad Administration manages an approximately $20 billion grant and loan portfolio focused on:</p>
<ul><li>Building new high-speed rail corridors that expand and fundamentally improve passenger transportation in the geographic regions they serve;</li>
<li>Upgrading existing intercity passenger rail corridors to improve reliability, speed, and frequency of existing services; and</li>
<li>Laying the groundwork, through corridor and state planning, for future high-speed rail services.</li>
</ul><p>For the High-Speed and Intercity Passenger Rail Program, FRA selected 153 projects across the country, with nearly 85 percent of rail investments concentrated in 6 corridors (San Francisco-Los Angeles, Boston-New York City-Washington, D.C., Seattle-Portland-Eugene, Charlotte-Washington, D.C., Chicago-St. Louis, and Chicago-Detroit). These corridors are in five mega-regions, in which about 65 percent of the U.S. population resides and which will likely absorb the bulk of future population growth.</p>
<p>FRA has developed a sophisticated grants management apparatus, laid the foundation for sustainable long-term passenger rail improvements, and strengthened industry capacity to deliver rail projects through technical assistance and strategic initiatives. FRA is strongly committed to robust stakeholder outreach, communication, and collaboration as central components of program management, allowing FRA to identify program improvements, engage in project planning and development, and provide the support necessary for grantees to carry out projects successfully.</p>

As of December 2014, ERAM achieved Initial Operation Capability at all 20 Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs).  By March 2015, all 20 Air Route Traffic Control Centers will have achieved Operational Readiness Date (ORD) for ERAM.</p>
<p>The En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) System replaces the 40-year-old En Route HOST Computer System and backup system used at 20 FAA ARTCCs around the country.  ERAM is the main computer system air traffic controllers use to guide airplanes flying at high altitudes.  Air traffic control towers, terminal radar approach control facilities, the Air Traffic Control System Command Center, flight service stations, and other agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense, all connect to and use the information managed by the En Route HOST Computer System.  The original HOST computer software architecture was developed in the late 1960s and was implemented as National Airspace System (NAS) Stage A in the early 1970s.</p>
<p>For controllers, ERAM provides a user-friendly interface with customizable displays.  Trajectory modeling is more accurate than in HOST, allowing maximum airspace use, better conflict detection, and improved decision making.  ERAM will substantially increase the number of flights that can be tracked and displayed to controllers from 1,100 to 1,900.  The ERAM system also provides two functionally identical channels with dual redundancy, providing a more robust back-up capability than today's environment.  Coverage will also extend beyond facility boundaries, enabling controllers to handle additional traffic more efficiently because ERAM is designed to process data from up to 64 radars instead of the current 24.  The ERAM system is needed to replace the current HOST system and allow the FAA to continue to provide the high level of safe, reliable air traffic control services that the nation has come to expect; and also put in place the infrastructure necessary to transition the NAS to NextGen.</p>

</p>
                        <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>In 2011, 34,414 people died and more than 2.2 million people were injured in transportation-related crashes and accidents, according to U.S. DOT national Transportation Statistics.  Motor vehicle crashes caused 32,367 fatalities, or 94 percent of the total, even though the rate of fatalities per hundred million miles of travel was the lowest ever recorded in the United States.  Distracted driving was a contributing factor in at least 3,331 fatal crashes.  Another 1, 213 people died in rail, air, and transit accidents.  We will use our safety programs and regulations for automobiles, airplanes, railroads, trucks, motorcoaches, pipelines, and hazardous materials as effectively as possible to reduce crashes, fatalities, and injuries, and will expand safety oversight to public transit.  We will continue to direct federal resources to address the most serious safety risks and implement program reforms that will advance our safety mission. Between 2001 and 2010, an average of 13 people in the United States died every year in incidents related to the transportation of hazardous material—a rate of one death for every 21 billion ton-miles of hazardous material moved.  In addition to causing deaths and injuries, hazardous material transportation incidents disrupt communities when people are evacuated from their homes, business activity is curtailed, and transportation services are interrupted.  We will continue to develop and encourage the use of safety tools - such as improved data collection, risk management practices, and incident response planning - to prevent, mitigate, and respond to hazardous material transportation accidents.</p>

<p>In the past, the FAA focused on actual incidents and accidents to identify risk within the aviation system.  The number of accidents has now dropped to a level in which this is a more difficult activity.  The FAA has now developed a proactive approach to identify and address risk.  This is done through dramatically increased air traffic data collection, improved analysis, and the implementation of safety mitigations put in place before an accident occurs.</p>
