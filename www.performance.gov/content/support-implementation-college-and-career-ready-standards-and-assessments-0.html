            <!--<div class="teaser collapsed">

            <div class="">
                <p><strong>GOAL OVERVIEW</strong></p>
<p>The adoption of college- and career-ready standards is the foundation to improving educational outcomes for all students and a fundamental step toward meeting the President’s goal of once again having the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020.  The college- and career-ready standards must be coupled with high-quality aligned assessments to measure the extent to which students are mastering the standards.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>KEY BARRIERS AND CHALLENGES</strong></p>
<p>A key challenge facing the Department of Education (ED) over the next two years  relates to the changes States may make to their currently adopted college- and career-ready standards due to changes from state leadership or the state legislature. Another key challenge is supporting states with the implementation of their college- and career-ready aligned assessments for all students, including English Learners, students with disabilities, economically disadvantaged and low-achieving students to ensure that all students are prepared for post-secondary success. </p>
<p>ED is taking steps to address these challenges by developing and targeting technical assistance activities that will, in part, increase state capacity to leverage limited resources and continue to identify promising practices across multiple states.  First, ED has released its Title I assessment peer review guidance, which  highlights the requirements for a high-quality assessment to help support state assessment development; in FY 2016, ED will begin conducting peer review of state assessment systems, providing examples of promising and best practices in the field.  ED will build also library of resources to assist SEAs in full and effective transition to college- and career-ready standards, leveraging work that has occurred during Race to the Top with other partner organizations such as Achieve, Student Achievement Partners, PTA, and others. In addition, ED is working internally to coordinate the provision of technical assistance across OESE, the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP), and other related offices and programs.  ED also funds a Center on Standards and Assessments Implementation (part of the ESEA Comprehensive Centers program) that helps build the capacity of State educational agencies to implement college- and career-ready standards.    </p>

<p>Finally, ED is working with states to provide communication support and technical assistance to help states and LEAs reduce redundant and unaligned local assessments, as well as to help states develop a process and strategy to share state assessment results from 2014-2015 as scores are likely to drop due to increased rigor of the assessments. Among other activities, this includes assisting states in resetting baselines and annual goals related to student performance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS</strong></p>
<p>ED consistently engaged with Congress, advocacy organizations, education organizations, State educational agencies and other external stakeholders regarding Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) flexibility, including state plans for transitioning to and implementing college- and career-ready standards.  ED has met with stakeholders to provide information on state plans, as well as to enlist external support and technical assistance for states and districts as they move forward with implementing the new standards.</p>

<p>The Department of Education (ED) will use the ESEA flexibility monitoring process to track state implementation and to identify areas where technical assistance is needed.  This monitoring approach, now institutionalized as part of the OSS restructuring, builds on the partnerships created with States during the initial ESEA flexibility approval process, including the use of cross-Departmental teams, reducing burden and duplication, and reducing overlap between other ED programs and ESEA flexibility.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ED is using the ESEA flexibility renewal process to ensure that states are meeting commitments to implement college- and career-ready standards with high-quality, aligned, valid, and reliable assessments, for all students.  ED released renewal guidance in Fall 2014 requiring states to continue to meet commitments to implement college- and career-ready standards and aligned assessments for all students in order to maintain ESEA flexibility.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>EXTERNAL FACTORS THAT ED CAN AND CANNOT INFLUENCE</strong></p>
<p>External factors that ED can influence:</p>
<p>•State capacity for successful implementation by the State and districts</p>
<p>•Slow development of aligned assessments by states (or transition/implementation costs of assessments)</p>
<p>•Ability (both perception and capacity) for ED to actively support implementation work</p>
<p>•Potential negative reaction to common  standards</p>
<p>•Engagement of institutions of higher education</p>
<p>Engagement of national civil rights organizations</p>
<p>•Success or lack of success of early-implementing states and whether these states provide good examples for others</p>
<p> </p>
<p>External factors that ED cannot influence:</p>
<p>•Changes in state philosophy about education reform</p>
<p>•C​hanges in State-level leadership and staff</p>
<p>•Congressional and state legislative action regarding college- and career-ready standards and assessments</p>

            <h2>Progress Update</h2>
            <div>
                <ul><li>All States with ESEA flexibility (42 States, DC and Puerto Rico), including those not participating in PARCC or Smarter Balanced, developed and implemented an assessment system aligned to the State’s college- and career-ready standards in 2014-2015, primarily during FY 2015 Q3.</li>
<li>Race to the Top - Assessment (RTTA) consortia and consortia that are developing alternate assessments based on alternate achievement standards completed the field testing of their assessments during the 2013-2014 school year and successfully implemented the first full administration in spring 2015.</li>
<li>29 states, DC, and the US Virgin Islands participated in the Partnerships for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC) and Smarter Balanced (the two RTTA consortia) first operational administration in spring 2015.</li>
<li>ED’s monitoring of Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) flexibility for the 41 states, DC, and Puerto Rico that were approved in windows 1, 2, 3 and 4, examined progress in implementing college- and career-ready standards and assessments.</li>
<li>In Q1 of 2015 (fall 2014), ED released guidance related to the ESEA flexibility renewal process, which will support State progress toward implementation of college- and career-ready standards and high-quality aligned assessments.</li>
<li>As of September 30, 2015, ED had approved ESEA flexibility requests for 39 states, DC and Puerto Rico. All states, DC, and Puerto Rico that are eligible for renewal (Illinois is not eligible until after the 2015-2016 school year, when its current waivers expire), as well as one new state (Nebraska), submitted renewal requests during FY 2015.  </li>
<li>In FY 2015, ED completed a reorganization within the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education by creating the new Office of State Support that combines the Office of Student Achievement and School Accountability, the Office of School Turnaround, and the Implementation and Support Unit, as well as several programs from other offices.  This new office will enable OESE to provide better and more differentiated support for States on their implementation of key reform efforts, including implementation of college- and career-ready standards and high-quality aligned assessments. </li>
<li>
<p>ED used the ESEA flexibility renewal process in quarters 3 and 4 to support states’ continued efforts toward implementing college- and career-ready standards and high-quality aligned assessments.  Throughout FY 2015 and FY 2016, ED will continue to explore strategies to support for states and districts in implementing college- and career-ready standards.  ED will also continue to implement its monitoring processes for OSS programs, including ESEA flexibility, to provide feedback on state implementation of college- and career-ready standards and assessments.  ED will ensure that where monitoring has identified challenges in implementation, states address these challenges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Q4, ED  disseminated revised criteria and process for ED’s peer review of state assessment systems under Title I of the ESEA and began providing guidance  technical assistance to support all states, not just those with waivers under ESEA flexibility, in preparing for peer review. ED will begin peer review of each State’s system during FY 2016.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ED will work with internal and external partners to provide States and districts with communication support and technical assistance to reduce redundant and unaligned local assessments, as well as to help states develop a process and strategy to share state assessment results from 2014-2015 as scores are likely to drop due to increased rigor of the assessments. </p>
</li>
<li>Because a significant number of States are changing assessments between the SY 2014-2015 and SY 2015-2016, this goal will be maintained in FY 2016 and FY 2017.</li>

</p>
                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p><strong>GOAL OVERVIEW</strong></p>
<p>The goal is based on the premise, supported by abundant research, that teachers are the single most critical in-school factor in improving student achievement.  Principals are often cited as the second most influential in-school factor.  Teacher and principal evaluation and support systems supported by the Department of Education's (ED) contributing programs enable the development and identification of effective educators and provide needed information to improve the educator workforce.  Teachers and principals often lack meaningful evaluation, feedback, and support for professional growth. Indeed, teachers are often dissatisfied with their preparation programs and their opportunities for professional development and advancement. Too often, effective teachers and leaders are not recognized, rewarded, or asked to share their expertise with colleagues. Most teacher compensation systems do not recognize effectiveness or provide incentives to teach in challenging schools or shortage areas. And race and family income too often predict a child’s access to excellent educators. In light of the importance of teachers and school leadership for student success, the nation has to do more to ensure that every student has an effective teacher, every school has an effective leader, and every teacher and leader has access to the preparation, on-going support, recognition, and collaboration opportunities he or she needs to succeed. ED will help strengthen the profession by focusing on meaningful feedback, support, and incentives at every stage of a career, based on fair evaluation and support systems that look at multiple measures, including, in significant part, growth in student learning. ED will support state and district efforts that provide time for teacher collaboration, personalized on-the-job learning opportunities, and professional advancement. Targets are based on state implementation timelines provided through original Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) flexibility requests.  These timelines indicated that 37 states expected to implement the systems by September 30, 2015.  “Fully implemented” is defined as the school year in which teachers and principals receive effectiveness ratings.  However, as states and districts are moving forward, they are also encountering challenges with implementation of these systems, and are making adjustments to timelines, sequencing, and implementation steps that may not follow their original plans but will ultimately result in high-quality teacher and principal evaluation and support systems.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>KEY BARRIERS AND CHALLENGES</strong></p>
<p>ED will support states in the development and adoption of state requirements for comprehensive teacher and principal evaluation and support systems and in district development and implementation of comprehensive educator evaluation and support systems. Providing additional support to teachers and principals, as well as educator evaluators regarding these new evaluation and support systems is necessary so they are able, for example, to use and develop learning objectives to measure growth in student learning and to implement new classroom observation tools.  However, providing this level of support is also resource-intense at both the state educational agency (SEA) and local educational agency (LEA) level.  Additional challenges center on maintaining momentum for reform, given districts’ and states’ current political situations, potential changes in leadership, ongoing development of valid and reliable measures of growth in student learning in non-tested grades and subjects, and the scaling up of systems in a relatively short time frame.</p>

<p>Engagement of external stakeholders is regular and ongoing.  Program staff have regular contact with SEA staff through monitoring, technical assistance, and other outreach.  Policy and program staff regularly hold calls and travel to the Hill to brief member and committee staff.  ED has also engaged with and provided briefings for key external educational organizations, including the Council of Chief State School Officers, the National Governors Association, National Education Association, and American Federation of Teachers.  Ongoing outreach further involves a wide range of professional and content organizations, national community-based organizations, and foundations.</p>

<p>The adoption of college- and career-ready standards is the foundation to improving educational outcomes for all students and a fundamental step toward meeting the President’s goal of once again having the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020.  The college- and career-ready standards must be coupled with high-quality aligned assessments to measure the extent to which students are mastering the standards.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>KEY BARRIERS AND CHALLENGES</strong></p>
<p>A key challenge facing the Department of Education (ED) over the next two years  relates to the changes States may make to their currently adopted college- and career-ready standards due to changes from state leadership or the state legislature. Another key challenge is supporting states with the implementation of their college- and career-ready aligned assessments for all students, including English Learners, students with disabilities, economically disadvantaged and low-achieving students to ensure that all students are prepared for post-secondary success. </p>
<p>ED is taking steps to address these challenges by developing and targeting technical assistance activities that will, in part, increase state capacity to leverage limited resources and continue to identify promising practices across multiple states.  First, ED has released its Title I assessment peer review guidance, which  highlights the requirements for a high-quality assessment to help support state assessment development; in FY 2016, ED will begin conducting peer review of state assessment systems, providing examples of promising and best practices in the field.  ED will build also library of resources to assist SEAs in full and effective transition to college- and career-ready standards, leveraging work that has occurred during Race to the Top with other partner organizations such as Achieve, Student Achievement Partners, PTA, and others. In addition, ED is working internally to coordinate the provision of technical assistance across OESE, the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP), and other related offices and programs.  ED also funds a Center on Standards and Assessments Implementation (part of the ESEA Comprehensive Centers program) that helps build the capacity of State educational agencies to implement college- and career-ready standards.    </p>

<p>Finally, ED is working with states to provide communication support and technical assistance to help states and LEAs reduce redundant and unaligned local assessments, as well as to help states develop a process and strategy to share state assessment results from 2014-2015 as scores are likely to drop due to increased rigor of the assessments. Among other activities, this includes assisting states in resetting baselines and annual goals related to student performance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS</strong></p>
<p>ED consistently engaged with Congress, advocacy organizations, education organizations, State educational agencies and other external stakeholders regarding Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) flexibility, including state plans for transitioning to and implementing college- and career-ready standards.  ED has met with stakeholders to provide information on state plans, as well as to enlist external support and technical assistance for states and districts as they move forward with implementing the new standards.</p>
