                        <p>OPM's mission is to recruit, retain, and honor a world-class workforce to serve the American people. To focus our efforts, OPM developed the goals and strategies contained in the updated <a href="http://www.opm.gov/about-us/budget-performance/strategic-plans/2014-2018-strategic-plan.pdf" title="2014-2018-strategic-plan">2014 – 2018 Strategic Plan – Recruit, Retain, and Honor. (PDF file)</a> [1.19 MB]</p>
<p>The Office of Personnel Management exists to support and strengthen the Federal workforce. As such, we strive to be a model of employee engagement, diversity and inclusion, and workforce development so that all our people feel connected to our mission and responsibly empowered to serve our stakeholders. At OPM, we encourage open, honest and direct dialogue between and among supervisors and employees—genuine, respectful dialogue that values diversity of thought to enable creativity and innovation. We expect supervisors and their teams to be mutually accountable for providing world-class customer service and consistently excellent results. Above all, we are committed to building trust in OPM by listening to those we serve, collaborating with our colleagues, utilizing our collective expertise, and analyzing our results so we may continuously improve. Only by working together in this way can we truly recruit, retain, and honor a world-class workforce to serve the American people.</p>

                        <p>A detailed discussion of OPM’s major activities and key initiatives is found on our website at our home page <a href="http://www.opm.gov/">www.opm.gov</a> or in our Annual Performance Report at <a href="http://www.opm.gov/about-us/budget-performance/performance/">http://www.opm.gov/about-us/budget-performance/performance/</a>.</p>
<p>Through our initiatives, programs, and materials, we seek to recruit and hire the best talent; to train and motivate employees to achieve their greatest potential; and to constantly promote an inclusive work force defined by diverse perspectives.</p>
<p>OPM provides human resources, leadership, and support to Federal agencies and helps the Federal workforce achieve their aspirations as they serve the American people. " We're responsible for keeping the government running smoothly — a responsibility that has daily consequences for every citizen.</p>
<p>We've set our sights on making the U.S. Federal Service America's model employer for the 21st century, with the following clear and measurable objectives:</p>
<ul><li>Make searching and applying for Federal jobs easier and faster;</li>
<li>Provide Federal employees benefits that are relevant, flexible, fair, and rewarding;</li>
<li>Make Federal employment accessible — and possible — for every American who seeks it; and</li>
<li>Retain a Federal workforce as diverse and versatile as the work it does and the people it serves.</li>
</ul><p>The men and women of the Federal Service are ready to attend to America’s needs for safety, security, and prosperity. We're here to keep them energized, equipped, and fully engaged.</p>
<h2>Policy and Oversight</h2>
<p>OPM oversees all policy created to support Federal human resources departments — from classification and qualifications systems to hiring authorities and from performance management to pay, leave, and benefits. Along with making those policies, we are responsible for ensuring they are properly implemented and continue to be correctly carried out.</p>
<h2>Healthcare and Insurance (HI)</h2>
<p>Healthcare &amp; Insurance ensures the availability of quality benefits for the Federal family. We work to facilitate access to the high-caliber healthcare and insurance programs offered by the Federal Government, including: health services; dental and vision benefits; flexible spending accounts; life insurance; and long-term care programs.  HI also develops and administers programs that provide high quality and affordable health insurance to uninsured Americans through Affordable Insurance Exchanges, uninsured Americans with pre-existing medical conditions who cannot otherwise purchase coverage, and employees of tribes or tribal organizations.</p>
<h2>Retirement Services (RS)</h2>
<p>OPM provides Governmentwide administration of retirement benefits and services for all Federal employees. We honor our Federal retiree’s years of service to their country by assuring reliable and courteous service throughout retirement.</p>
<h2>Services for Agencies</h2>
<p>As the central human resources planners for the Federal Government, OPM is responsible for the successful management of human capital, not only within our own organization, but also across every Federal agency. We assist Federal agencies in hiring new employees, provide Federal investigative services for background checks, create training programs to develop tomorrow's leaders — and much more.</p>

<div class="intro_text">
<p>Established by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goals are a tool used to accelerate progress on a limited number of priority areas where implementation requires active collaboration between multiple agencies, overcoming organizational barriers to achieve better performance than one agency can achieve on its own.</p>
<p>Set or revised at least every four years, CAP Goals include outcome-oriented goals that cover a limited number of crosscutting policy areas as well as management goals focused on management improvements across the Federal Government in areas of financial management, strategic human capital management, information technology management, procurement and acquisition management, and real property management.</p>
<p>A series of 16 CAP Goals were announced in the 2015 Budget with clearly named accountable officials, data-driven reviews that incorporated a broad range of quantitative and qualitative inputs, and reporting to the public through a common website as a framework to drive performance improvements on cross-government collaboration and tackle government-wide management challenges affecting most agencies.</p>

<p>On June 30, 2016, the President signed into law the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 – nearly 50 years after President Johnson signed the original FOIA into law.  This critical legislation reflects the progress made by the Administration, codifies a number of openness and transparency principles, and ensures that the Administration’s track record of openness is institutionalized throughout government and carries forward for years to come.  Concurrent with the signing of the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, the White House released a Fact Sheet committing the Administration to:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Utilizing the Chief FOIA Officers Council and FOIA Advisory Committee to address FOIA’s greatest challenges;</p>

</div>  </div>  
  <div class="views-field views-field-field-cag-overview-revision-id">    <span class="views-label views-label-field-cag-overview-revision-id">Overview: </span>    <div class="field-content"><p>On March 19, 2015, the President issued Executive Order 13693, <em>Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade</em>, which set forth ambitious climate, energy, and environmental sustainability goals for Federal agencies over the next decade.  Executive departments and agencies have been among our Nation’s leaders as the United States works to build a clean energy economy that will sustain our prosperity and the health of our people and our environment for generations to come. Federal leadership in energy, environmental water, transportation fleets, buildings, and acquisition management will continue to drive national greenhouse gas reductions and support preparations for the impacts of climate change. The Federal Government has the opportunity to significantly reduce direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2025, while at the same time fostering innovation, reducing spending, and strengthening the communities in which our Federal facilities operate. </p>
<p>Employing this strategy for the next decade calls for expanded and updated Federal environmental performance goals with a clear overarching objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions across Federal operations and the Federal supply chain.  Goals for greenhouse gas emissions reduction (40% by 2025), renewable electricity (30% by 2025), clean energy (25% by 2025), and performance contracting ($4 billion in awarded contracts by Dec. 2016) are already well established in the Federal community. The enhanced target for each of these goals will require agencies to sharpen their focus on achieving the goals through existing mechanisms and new technologies that enhance efficiency and use of clean energy.</p>
<p>CEQ and OMB have worked closely to ensure that Federal agencies understand the necessary steps to pursuing the new environmental sustainability goals and those efforts are supported by an interagency Steering Committee.  Pursuit of these sustainability goals will involve at least 25 of the largest Federal agencies. Success will be greatly enhanced by the cross-cutting nature of the goals and the similarity in the tools and procedures used for implementation.</p>
<p>While all Federal agencies have an important role to play in ensuring the Government meets its energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets, key delivery agencies include: The General Services Administration, Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Energy, National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Department of Homeland Security.</p>

In the wake of increasing threats and incidents, the President directed a series of reviews to examine current security, suitability/fitness, and credentialing processes and to recommend areas in need of reform. The interagency reviews identified problem areas and made specific recommendations, which were approved by the Performance Accountability Council (PAC). The PAC developed the Strategic Intent to build upon these efforts and create a lasting impact by providing overarching strategic direction to personnel security, suitability/fitness, and credentialing reform efforts for the next five years.  </p>
<p>The Strategic Intent represents our framework for sustaining progress mandated by the February 2014 Suitability and Security Processes Review Report to the President, the January 2016 PAC Review of Background Investigations, relevant legislation, and other key drivers. It builds on progress since the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 and the subsequent, significant reform efforts that resulted in greater standardization and alignment of suitability and security processes. Through this framework, the PAC will work with other members of the Executive Branch to drive continuous process improvement to personnel security, suitability/fitness, and credentialing programs and address evolving threats. While we cannot eliminate risk altogether, it is imperative that we work across disciplines to maximize our collective efforts to mitigate the risks we face, while ensuring appropriate protections for privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. We must ensure measures to improve these programs avoid imposing unreasonable burdens on the Federal workforce that could negatively impact operations. Therefore, the Federal Government will pursue a balanced approach by addressing the risks posed by personnel who could do significant harm by virtue of the nature of their position.</p>
<p>These reforms will further support ongoing Insider Threat Program implementation by providing earlier detection and improving the quality of vetting. The improved attention to cybersecurity will reinforce efforts to protect sensitive mission data, including personally-identifiable information. </p>

According to AT Kearney’s Foreign Direct Investment Confidence Index, confidence in the U.S. as a location for FDI is high, ranking as the top destination for investment ahead of China, Brazil, Canada, and India.<sup>1 </sup>The U.S. remains the world’s largest economy and is also the largest recipient of foreign direct investment in the world. Over the last ten years, U.S. affiliates of foreign companies have employed more than five million workers, the majority of which are high-paying manufacturing jobs. On average, jobs created by FDI in United States pay up to 30% more.<sup>2</sup>  However, due to global capital mobility and increased foreign competition, we need to take steps to maintain and grow our share of global investment.</p>
<p>Historically, we have left our states and cities to compete for investments with a country’s investment promotion agency, limiting our opportunities to clearly demonstrate our commitment to attracting investment and to leverage our advantages as a top destination for investment. In 2011, through Executive Order, the U.S. launched SelectUSA, the first Federal effort to promote and facilitate inbound business investment. The E.O. created the Interagency Investment Working Group (IIWG) to further design and implement the first-ever coordinated U.S. investment promotion authority. As a driver for success, the global investment team, consisting of both SelectUSA headquarters in DC and investment teams at posts led by Ambassadors, will increase the number of active investment cases touched to encourage business investments.</p>
<p>At the first SelectUSA Investment Summit in Oct 31-Nov. 1 2013, the President reformed SelectUSA, creating a number of firsts: for the first time there will be a clear system for advocacy for high-priority, job-creating investments, driven by the most senior Administration officials all the way up to the President; for the first time there will be a single point of contact for ready investors looking to bring jobs and production to the U.S.; lastly, the Administration is engaging in unprecedented coordinated support for states and localities to attract investment.</p>
<p>Key contributing agencies to the Job-Creating Investment CAP goal include the Department of Commerce, Small Business Administration, US Department of Agriculture, Department of State, Department of Homeland Security, and Export-Import Bank of the U.S.</p>

Over time, the process and legal requirements for the permitting and review of major infrastructure projects have developed in a siloed and ad-hoc way, creating complex processes that in some cases have taken years or longer to complete.  Although there are several reasons why a major infrastructure project may be delayed (including applicant funding uncertainty and state and local reviews), over the past three years the Administration has undertaken an ambitious effort to modernize the Federal government’s role in permitting and review processes.</p>
<p>To ensure his Administration took action to modernize these permitting and review processes, on March 22, 2012, the President signed Executive Order 13604, Improving Performance of Federal Permitting and Review of Infrastructure Projects and subsequently a Presidential Memorandum on May 17, 2013, charging an interagency Steering Committee to lead the development of a plan to turn best practices into standard practice.  This Implementation Plan identifies four strategies, 15 reforms, and nearly 100 both near-term and long-term milestones.  The strategies are:</p>
<ul><li>Strategy 1: Institutionalize Interagency Coordination and Transparency, by formalizing interagency coordination policies, including early identification of a lead agency; synchronizing Federal review and permitting processes and decisions; standardizing the use of the Infrastructure Permitting Dashboard; and identifying best practices for early engagement with State, Local and Tribal governments.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Strategy 2:  Improve Project Planning, Siting, and Application Quality by developing tools to assist project applicants in planning for a major infrastructure project and support effective and timely decision-making by agency staff once the Federal processes begins. </li>
</ul><ul><li>Strategy 3: Improve Permitting Reviews and Mitigation by supporting agency staff in effectively implementing existing regulations, policies, and guidance as well as identifying barriers.

Advances in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) have long been central to our Nation’s ability to manufacture better and smarter products, improve health care, develop cleaner and more efficient domestic energy sources, preserve the environment, safeguard national security, and grow the economy. For the United States to maintain its preeminent position in the world it will be essential that the Nation continues to lead in STEM, but evidence indicates that current educational pathways are not leading to a sufficiently large and well-trained STEM workforce to achieve this goal, nor is the U.S. education system cultivating a culture of STEM education necessary for a STEM-literate public. Thus it is essential that the United States enhance U.S. students’ engagement in STEM disciplines and inspire and equip many more students to excel in STEM fields.</p>
<p>A number of Federal agencies place a high priority on STEM education and have developed education initiatives unique to their agency’s mission, needs, and resources.  To better leverage Federal assets, expertise, and partnerships toward a goal of national importance, a cross agency priority to improve STEM education has been developed to increase agency coordination and use of evidence-based approaches to improve P-12 STEM instruction, increase and sustain youth and public engagement in STEM, enhance the STEM experience of undergraduate students, better serve groups historically underrepresented in STEM fields, design graduate education for tomorrow’s STEM workforce, build new models for leveraging assets and expertise, and build and use evidence-based approaches. </p>

</div>  </div>  
  <div class="views-field views-field-field-cag-overview-revision-id">    <span class="views-label views-label-field-cag-overview-revision-id">Overview: </span>    <div class="field-content"><p>The American people deserve a Government that is responsive to their needs. Citizens and businesses expect government services to be well-designed, efficient, and generally comparable to the services they receive from leading private sector organizations. Whether they call the IRS for an answer to a tax question or visit a Social Security Administration office to adjust their benefits, they should experience high-quality interactions with the Federal Government. Despite some important strides to improve customer service over the past fifteen years, too often many Federal Government services fail to meet the expectations of citizens and business, creating unnecessary hassle and cost for citizens, businesses, and the government itself.  The Federal Government must keep pace with the public’s expectations and transform its customer services – soliciting regular customer feedback, streamlining processes, and delivering consistent quality service across customer channels.</p>
<p>To that end, in April 2011 the President issued an<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/27/executive-order-streamlining-service-delivery-and-improving-customer-ser" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/27/executive-order-streamlining-service-delivery-and-improving-customer-ser">Executive Order</a> requiring each agency to develop a customer service plan that identified implementation steps for their customer service activities, including a "signature initiative" that uses technology to improve the customer experience. Agencies posted the plans on their Open Government websites in October 2011, and this goal will build on these plans to streamline and improve customer service delivery.</p>
<p>To build upon the progress being made by individual agencies, the Administration is taking action to deliver improved customer service across the Federal enterprise.  The Administration will:</p>
<ul><li><em>Streamline transactions.</em>  Too often the processes and procedures of government have been developed piecemeal over time, and have not been regularly reexamined to ensure they are designed with the user experience in mind.  The Administration will identify transactions with a high impact on a significant number of citizens and streamline processes, better meet customer needs, and use performance measures to improve services.  This includes areas such as TSA security screening, veterans’ pension and disability applications, income-based repayment of student loans, Social Security, and taxpayer assistance.</li>
<li><em>Develop standards for high impact services.</em>  Citizen expectations for government services are continually increasing, driven by improvements in technology and the high quality services provided by the private sector.  Government leaders have a responsibility to understand customer expectations and service needs, and continually evaluate and improve their effectiveness in meeting those needs.  To facilitate this, many government programs that provide direct services to the public can benefit from setting customer service standards, clearly communicating these standards to customers, and ensuring these standards are being met.  The Administration will identify best practices in setting customer service standards, such as placing an emphasis on first contact resolution, and facilitate implementation of these practices for high impact services.</li>
<li><em>Utilize technology to improve the customer experience.</em>  The Administration will work to deliver world-class customer services to citizens by making it faster and easier for individuals and businesses to complete transactions with government online.  Given the continually growing importance of online services, the Administration has established a separate Cross-Agency Priority Goal to focus resources and attention on this priority area. </li>

The Administration will work with agencies to utilize existing authorities to attract top talent and consult with Agencies, the Office of Personnel Management, and Congressional stakeholders to expand the use of flexible hiring authorities. The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will also work with Agencies to incubate and scale new approaches to the design, development and delivery of top digital services and transactions.</li>
<li>Get the best companies working with government. The Administration’s efforts in this area will focus on streamlining the Federal IT acquisition process. Specific initiatives include creating more visibility of contracting opportunities for small, innovative companies; maximizing the use of available contracting flexibilities and best practices; and recommending administrative changes to the IT procurement processes.</li>
<li>Put the right processes and practices in place to drive outcomes and accountability. OMB will create and apply a new oversight and management process to highest impact IT investments in the Federal government. This process will include the best IT development and management approaches employed by the public and private sectors.  Lessons learned from this oversight process will be used to expand best practices across all agency IT investments.</li>

Today, proposals for contracts are lengthy, overly prescriptive, and laden with Government-specific requirements. There is also staggering duplication of contracts across Government and very little information sharing between agencies on pricing or other important contractual information. In order to fundamentally improve how taxpayer dollars are used in the Federal contracting space, the Administration is embarking on a comprehensive initiative to enhance collaboration and cooperation and drive greater innovation and improved performance through the implementation of Category Management.</p>
<p>This cross-agency priority (CAP) goal is focused on category management and will build on the progress made in the strategic sourcing initiative, leveraging the consolidated purchasing power of the Government to buy smarter and reduce duplication.  Category management is a new, more strategic approach that will enable the federal government to buy smarter and more like a single enterprise.  It involves identifying core areas of spend, developing heightened levels of expertise, leveraging shared best practices, providing streamlined solutions for acquisition, and managing supply and demand.  The objective is to increase efficiency and effectiveness while reducing costs and redundancies.  The first area of focus for category management is information technology and the CAP goal will support this initiative.  The objectives of the Category Management CAP goal will be expanded as the Category Management Leadership Council endorses other areas of focus.  The CAP Goal metrics can be found on the “supporting materials tabs” and progress updates will begin in the final Quarter of FY15.  </p>

If we are focused, committed, systematic, and intentional, we can make the sort of transformative changes in our service delivery approach that have altered the course of the commercial retail marketplace and reinvigorated American manufacturing. </p>
<p>We need to commit to driving efficiencies by creating opportunities to leverage existing resources and pool the government’s buying power.  This involves building common standards for underlying support activities and systems and driving out redundancy in administrative service provision.  It means changing agency expectations and incentives for spending.  And it means rethinking the way that the government considers and funds long-term investments in the systems and infrastructure that support customer service delivery. </p>
<p>The Federal Government will leverage the Executive Councils to develop common standards and benchmarks to measure shared service utilization, performance, and cost. Mandate those standards and benchmarks for common administrative services. From these standards and benchmarks we will drive efficiencies and greater performance by: 1) increasing the capacity of the Federal Shared Service Providers (SSPs) at DOI, USDA, Treasury, HHS, DOT and DOD; and 2) requiring use of lower-cost, higher-performing Shared Services for all agencies and SSPs which cannot meet established targets. We will target the following areas for Shared Services (listed in order of priority): financial, HR, technology, and acquisition.</p>

<p>The Administration will sustain and intensify these efforts in the second term by:</p>
<ul><li>Establishing cost and quality benchmarks for core/administrative operations, such as HR, Finance, Acquisition, and IT.  We will leverage the agency executive councils to develop common standards and benchmarks to measure shared service utilization, performance, and cost.  We will then use those standards and benchmarks for common administrative services as the baseline for driving continuous improvements in performance.</li>
<li>Cutting improper payments.

<p>The Administration has made significant progress in improving the management of information resources to increase interoperability and openness. In executive order 13642 President Obama outlined a clear vision for “Making Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information” wherever possible and legally permissible. The subsequently released Open Data Policy (OMB memorandum M-13-13) directed agencies to effectively “manage the information as a strategic asset” throughout its lifecycle and make data open by default to the extent permitted by law, while ensuring strict controls to safeguard individual privacy, confidentiality, and national security. </p>
<p>As a direct result, Americans are getting better access to government information and services they need. Homeowners who are struggling to pay their mortgages now get prompt, clear responses because companies are competing based on open consumer financial product complaint data published by CFPB, and can stay in their homes. Similarly, patients can now comparison shop to see which hospitals have the best outcomes and best prices thanks to data published by Medicaid and HHS—including a new dataset that for the first time shows what hospitals charge for inpatient services associated with the 100 most common kinds of hospital stays, revealing huge variations in hospital charges across the country and even within metro areas.</p>
<p>To drive further impact and results, the Open Data CAP Goal will focus on a series of government-wide objectives, strategies and major metrics that facilitate and gauge the outcome-oriented and management improvement goals of Open Data.  Metrics will prioritize three channels of impact measurement: impact on economic value creation organizations, impact on existing public program outcomes, and impact on internal government efficiency.  </p>

<ul><li>Enable Agencies to Hire the Best Talent from All Segments of Society.  We will collaborate with Federal stakeholders and labor groups to ensure a balanced strategic approach to improving hiring outcomes. In the short term, we will identify and address the erosion of the original flexibilities of Title 5.  In the long term, we will work closely with labor unions and use demonstration projects and/or legislation and regulatory changes to ensure that our hiring processes attract and retain America’s talent.  We will measure the success of this effort by assessing manager satisfaction with the quality of both applicants and their hires after six months on the job. </li>

                    <p>Agencies establish a variety of organizational goals to drive progress toward key outcomes for the American people. Long-term strategic goals articulate clear statements of what the agency wants to achieve to advance its mission and address relevant national problems, needs, challenges and opportunities. Strategic objectives define the outcome or management impact the agency is trying to achieve, and also include the agency's role. Each strategic objective is tracked through a suite of performance goals, indicators and other evidence.

                                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>OPM is responsible for the Government-wide Diversity and Inclusion effort focused on developing, driving, and monitoring strategies and initiatives designed to create a more diverse and inclusive Federal workforce.  Executive Order 13583, “Establishing a Coordinated Government-wide Initiative to Promote Diversity and Inclusion in the Federal Workforce,” challenged the Federal Government with leading by example and attaining a diverse, qualified workforce that enables employees to contribute to their full potential.  Similarly, Executive Order 13548, “Increasing Federal Employment of Individuals with Disabilities,” requires agencies to improve their efforts to employ Federal workers with disabilities and targeted disabilities through increased recruitment, hiring, and retention of these individuals.</p>
<p>In FY 2012, OPM issued the Government-wide Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan to provide direction to fifty-seven participating departments and agencies under the two subject Executive Orders.  The three primary goals in the Plan included:</p>
<ol><li>Workforce Diversity. Recruit from a diverse, qualified group of potential applicants to secure a high-performing workforce drawn from all segments of American society;</li>
<li>Workplace Inclusion. Cultivate a culture that encourages collaboration, flexibility, and fairness to enable individuals to contribute to their full potential and further retention; and</li>
<li>Sustainability. Develop structures and strategies to equip leaders with the ability to manage diversity, be accountable, measure results, refine approaches on the basis of such data, and institutionalize a culture of inclusion.</li>
</ol><p>In support of the Diversity goal, OPM seeks to improve applicant flow reporting to enable human resources staff and hiring managers to determine whether recruitment efforts have been successful in drawing from all segments of society and to aid in developing future recruitment strategy.  Applicant flow data has historically been collected on the basis of race, national origin, and sex, and beginning in 2014, it will be collected on the basis of disability.  Historically, the data has been analyzed in an aggregate format; however, through the use of business intelligence tools, applicant flow data for individual hiring actions will be available for review at the hiring manager level after a vacancy has closed, creating incentive for increased hiring manager involvement in the recruitment process and greater opportunity for planning future recruitment efforts.</p>
<p>To further understand how to create an inclusive work environment where employees are fully engaged and productive, OPM and the Department of Veterans Affairs conducted factor analysis on the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey and found that twenty questions cluster into five areas or behaviors (i.e., fair, open, cooperative, supportive, and empowering) that create inclusive work environments.   Based on these five areas, OPM developed the “New IQ” (Inclusion Quotient) techniques and training to assist managers and supervisors in practicing behaviors that foster inclusion, an antecedent to employee engagement.  OPM will also continue to focus on the life cycle of the Federal employee to ensure that the Federal workforce is able to hire and develop the best talent from all segments of society, with a focus on internal Diversity and Inclusion efforts to ensure that we serve as a model agency.  Internal efforts will focus on the implementation of a data-driven, habit formation strategy that leverages first-line managers and supervisors to foster inclusion and engagement in the OPM workplace.</p>

<p>To further understand how to create an inclusive work environment where employees are fully engaged and productive, OPM and the Department of Veterans Affairs conducted factor analysis on the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey and found that twenty questions cluster into five areas or behaviors (i.e., fair, open, cooperative, supportive, and empowering) that create inclusive work environments.   Based on these five areas, OPM developed the “New IQ” (Inclusion Quotient) techniques and training to assist managers and supervisors in practicing behaviors that foster inclusion, an antecedent to employee engagement.  OPM will also continue to focus on the life cycle of the Federal employee to ensure that the Federal workforce is able to hire and develop the best talent from all segments of society, with a focus on internal Diversity and Inclusion efforts to ensure that we serve as a model agency.  Internal efforts will focus on the implementation of a data-driven, habit formation strategy that leverages first-line managers and supervisors to foster inclusion and engagement in the OPM workplace.</p>

<p>Continue enhancing the security of OPM's information systems by strengthening authentication and expanding the implementation of continuous monitoring.</p>
<p>OPM will increase the use of multi-factor strong authentication in multiple ways.  While OPM enforces Personal Identity Verification (PIV) authentication for its internal users, OPM targets PIV usage for OPM services at 50 percent of Federal users by the end of FY 2016.  By the end of FY 2017, OPM will enforce multi-factor authentication for 100 percent of all PIV-enabled users and 80 percent of non-PIV-enabled users.</p>
<p>OPM will increase its security posture by expanding the Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) capabilities throughout FY 2015.  Leveraging the Continuous Diagnostic and Mitigation (CDM) program, OPM will expand continuous diagnostic capabilities by increasing the network sensor capacity, automating sensor collections, and prioritizing risk alerts.  By the end of the second quarter of FY 2016, OPM will have acquired, implemented, and refined the four (4) CDM controls including vulnerability management, secure configuration management, hardware asset management, and software asset management.  These tools will increase OPM’s ability to identify and respond to security issues.  By the end of FY 2016, 95 percent of OPM’s assets will be visible in the CDM dashboard.  In FY 2017, OPM will use the benchmarking results to identify and prioritize the implementation of other ISCM controls.</p>
<p>OPM will continue to pursue a number of additional actions as outlined in its Cybersecurity Monitoring goal.</p>

<p>OPM stores more Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and other sensitive records than almost any other Federal agency.  This is a tremendous trust placed in the agency by the millions of current and former Federal employees, and one that OPM must continually earn through constant vigilance.</p>
<p>The prior breaches of OPM data make clear that cybersecurity must remain a priority for all agencies, but especially OPM.  As President Obama has said, “Both state and non-state actors are sending everything they’ve got at trying to breach these systems…And this problem is not going to go away.  It is going to accelerate.  And that means that we have to be as nimble, as aggressive, and as well-resourced as those who are trying to break into these systems.”</p>
<p> In a world of evolving threats, there is no such thing as “total cybersecurity.”  But the actions outlined by OPM, and continued collaboration with Federal partners, Congress, and outside experts, will ensure that OPM has the tools it needs to safeguard its systems and protect our nation’s citizens and the men and women that serve the Federal Government.</p>
<p>This goal aligns with Administration cybersecurity priorities. The goal was established in coordination with OMB policies and guidance, to include the Cybersecurity Strategy and Implementation Plan (CSIP), the Fiscal Year 2015-2016 Guidance on Federal Information Security and Privacy Management Requirements, and the Cybersecurity CAP goal.</p>

The initiative is being implemented in two phases, described below. OPM has designated closing Human Resources Skills Gaps, one of several focus areas under this initiative, as a 2014-2015 OPM Priority Goal.</p>
<p>Phase I created a Government-wide strategic workforce planning method through which agencies and the Chief Human Capital Officers Council (CHCOC) could identify occupations and competencies where staffing gaps could jeopardize the ability of the Government or specific agencies to accomplish their missions.  Agencies and the CHCOC used this common method to identify occupations and competencies for skills gaps closure.  Based on this analysis, the CHCOC identified six mission critical occupational groups and seven competencies, requiring government-wide focus.  The six occupational groups are Cybersecurity, Acquisition, Economist, Human Resources, Auditor and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics).  The seven competencies are strategic thinking, problem solving, data analysis, influencing/negotiating, grants management, grants management compliance, and grants financial management.  Successful skills gaps closure is critically dependent on a strong HR workforce who can provide strategies, programs and tools that help occupational leaders design and implement skills gaps closure efforts.  For this reason, OPM designated HR Skills Gaps as an Agency Priority Goal.</p>
<p>In Phase II, OPM has designated a sub-goal leader for each of the six occupational groups to assist OPM in identifying potential pilot projects through which effective skill gaps strategies could be explored in order to design a comprehensive skills gap closure strategy.  OPM’s Associate Director for Employee Services has served as the sub-goal leader for HR Skills Gaps Closure.  He chairs the CHCOC HR Skills Gaps Working Group, which meets monthly to set the direction for skills gap closure, provides research and design support, and makes recommendations to the CHCOC.</p>

<p>While OPM has made significant progress on timeliness since 2004, the agency has maintained its primary focus on delivering top quality products to agencies. OPM will work with its executive branch reform partners to develop and implement Executive Branch quality standards, with a measurement tool designed for universal application during both the investigative and adjudicative processes. OPM will focus on implementing these additional initiatives while maintaining timeliness objectives.  OPM will satisfy all national security standards, deliver quality products, and achieve Congressional and DNI mandated timeliness goals.</p>
<p>OPM is sensitive to the fiscal environment and the need for customer agencies (i.e., the employing or sponsoring agencies) to have more insight into the costs of background investigations. To this end, OPM will continue conducting business efficiency studies and maturing its cost allocation model to provide more detailed cost data and to optimize the value of OPM’s investigative products to agency adjudicators, which in turn translates into better value to taxpayers.</p>

The President’s Management Agenda and OPM Strategic Plan both rely critically on the ability of human resources professionals to keep abreast of innovations in talent management, evolving human resources policies, and new skills required for successful execution of Federal talent strategies.  Currently, investment in development for Federal HR professionals varies across agencies in approach, content, and quality.  To assure a leveling-up of HR professional development and support Government-wide HR reforms, OPM is partnering with the Chief Human Capital Officers Council to build a comprehensive curriculum of HR training and education to be delivered through the HR University (HRU).  The CHCO Council is using a Community Framework to develop an agreed approach to identifying required skills, assessing the current workforce competencies to identify gaps, and targeting the development of coursework toward high priority skills.   The HRU Curriculum will address all HR professional roles and technical specialty areas, and will consist of courses offered by OPM’s HR Solutions, as well as courses available from other Federal agencies.  The Community Framework also includes a credentialing strategy to be developed by the CHCO Council based on benchmarking of industry best practices.  A certification program will be built into the HRU Curriculum to support any future credentialing program.</p>
<p>The highest risk to successful execution of this goal is agencies’ willingness to pay for courses offered by HR University.  Recovering the investment costs for the curriculum and HRU operations is critical to OPM’s Human Resources Solutions’ (HRS) sustainable delivery of HRU curricula and developmental resources.  To mitigate this risk, HRS is collaborating closely with the CHCO Council HR Skills Gaps Executive Steering Committee to build the curriculum.  Through a co-production method, HRS will ensure that courses being offered directly meet agencies’ perceived needs for HR skills development.</p>

<p>While OPM has made significant progress on timeliness since 2004, the agency has maintained its primary focus on delivering top quality products to agencies. OPM will work with its executive branch reform partners to develop and implement Executive Branch quality standards, with a measurement tool designed for universal application during both the investigative and adjudicative processes. OPM will focus on implementing these additional initiatives while maintaining timeliness objectives.  OPM will satisfy all national security standards, deliver quality products, and achieve Congressional and DNI mandated timeliness goals.</p>
<p>OPM is sensitive to the fiscal environment and the need for customer agencies (i.e., the employing or sponsoring agencies) to have more insight into the costs of background investigations. To this end, OPM will continue conducting business efficiency studies and maturing its cost allocation model to provide more detailed cost data and to optimize the value of OPM’s investigative products to agency adjudicators, which in turn translates into better value to taxpayers.</p>

In 2016, FEHB plan performance will be assessed based on a common set of measures of clinical quality, customer service and appropriate resource use; this performance assessment will be used in the determination of plan profit margins.  While each plan will be assessed based on its performance, overall progress for the FEHB program will be measured by an increase in the number of FEHB plans at or above the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile of the relevant national, commercial benchmark  year-on-year as measured by FEHB plan scored values on the designated high priority indicators used continuously during the evaluation period.  These high priority measures include: risk adjusted all cause readmissions, timeliness of prenatal care and blood pressure control.</p>
</p>
                                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>To establish a consistent assessment system that includes objective performance standards, OPM has developed the FEHB Plan Performance Assessment. This assessment incorporates a discrete set of quantifiable measures to examine key aspects of health plan performance and a contract oversight evaluation by the contract officer. The FEHB Plan Performance Assessment will be linked to health plan profit. Quantifiable measures are grouped into three performance areas: Clinical Quality, Customer Services, and Resource Use (collectively termed QCR). The QCR measures consist of Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) and Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) measures. The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) oversees the set of HEDIS and CAHPS measures which is used nationwide to measure performance of health plans in various areas. OPM is using NCQA’s national or regional benchmarks in the FEHB Plan Performance Assessment.  </p>
<p>To focus attention on priority issues, OPM has developed a hierarchy for the QCR measures. In assigning priority levels to measures, OPM considered whether the measure assessed health outcomes, supported specific OPM policy priorities, and was relevant to FEHB subpopulations with particular health needs. Improvement on these high priority measures will indicate improved quality and carrier focus on critical healthcare areas for the FEHB Program.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This assessment system directly supports Goal 9 of the 2014-2018 OPM Strategic Plan by requiring that FEHB health plans meet rigorous industry standards and higher levels of health plan accountability. These higher standards and increased accountability lead to higher quality health benefits available to federal employees, federal retirees, their families, and newly eligible populations. This new initiative is also closely aligned with the current Administration’s goal of health care system improvement and parallels other federal agency and private payer processes.</p>

<p>OPM is implementing an FEHB Health Plan Performance Assessment project to measure and reward all FEHB plan performance (experience-rated and community-rated) through the use of common, objective, and quantifiable performance measures by the 2016 plan year.  This will be a new approach to our assessment of the annual performance of health plans contracted under the program.  The performance assessment framework will include a discrete set of qualitative and quantifiable performance measures that will be used to assess key aspects of performance.  That overall assessment will then be linked to health plan profit factors.  There are four primary categories of health plan performance to be assessed:  clinical quality, customer service, resource use, and contract oversight.</p>
<p>Industry standards state that, in private employer plans, as much as 10 percent of health claim benefits paid are incurred by family members who are not eligible for coverage.  The FEHB Program provides approximately 23 billion dollars in benefits annually for those covered under Self and Family enrollments. This may translate to approximately 23 million dollars for each percent paid in error. Under current FEHB procedures, agencies and the FEHB carriers both have responsibility for family member eligibility determinations. However, there is no evidence that family member eligibility is systematically verified at the time of the initial enrollment, when enrollment is changed during Open Season or upon experiencing a Qualifying Life Event (QLE) (although some agencies do require documentation for QLE changes) or at any time during the employee’s period of coverage.  With the advent of electronic enrollment systems, enrollees can make certain FEHB enrollment changes without submitting any proof to their agency benefit officers.</p>
<p>The extent of ineligible family members covered under FEHB Self and Family enrollments is currently unknown. In addition, presently there is no centralized FEHB enrollment system to maintain a database of eligible enrollees and family members. Enrollment systems that currently exist do not require the input of family member dependent information. Thus, there is no centralized database of the FEHB enrollments and consequently, no mechanism to determine who is receiving benefits under any one Self and Family enrollment.</p>

The President’s Management Agenda and OPM Strategic Plan both rely critically on the ability of human resources professionals to keep abreast of innovations in talent management, evolving human resources policies, and new skills required for successful execution of Federal talent strategies.  Currently, investment in development for Federal HR professionals varies across agencies in approach, content, and quality.  To assure a leveling-up of HR professional development and support Government-wide HR reforms, OPM is partnering with the Chief Human Capital Officers Council to build a comprehensive curriculum of HR training and education to be delivered through the HR University (HRU).  The CHCO Council is using a Community Framework to develop an agreed approach to identifying required skills, assessing the current workforce competencies to identify gaps, and targeting the development of coursework toward high priority skills.   The HRU Curriculum will address all HR professional roles and technical specialty areas, and will consist of courses offered by OPM’s HR Solutions, as well as courses available from other Federal agencies.  The Community Framework also includes a credentialing strategy to be developed by the CHCO Council based on benchmarking of industry best practices.  A certification program will be built into the HRU Curriculum to support any future credentialing program.</p>
<p>The highest risk to successful execution of this goal is agencies’ willingness to pay for courses offered by HR University.  Recovering the investment costs for the curriculum and HRU operations is critical to OPM’s Human Resources Solutions’ (HRS) sustainable delivery of HRU curricula and developmental resources.  To mitigate this risk, HRS is collaborating closely with the CHCO Council HR Skills Gaps Executive Steering Committee to build the curriculum.  Through a co-production method, HRS will ensure that courses being offered directly meet agencies’ perceived needs for HR skills development.</p>

In 2016, FEHB plan performance will be assessed based on a common set of measures of clinical quality, customer service and appropriate resource use; this performance assessment will be used in the determination of plan profit margins.  While each plan will be assessed based on its performance, overall progress for the FEHB program will be measured by an increase in the number of FEHB plans at or above the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile of the relevant national, commercial benchmark  year-on-year as measured by FEHB plan scored values on the designated high priority indicators used continuously during the evaluation period.  These high priority measures include: risk adjusted all cause readmissions, timeliness of prenatal care and blood pressure control.</p>
</p>
                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>To establish a consistent assessment system that includes objective performance standards, OPM has developed the FEHB Plan Performance Assessment. This assessment incorporates a discrete set of quantifiable measures to examine key aspects of health plan performance and a contract oversight evaluation by the contract officer. The FEHB Plan Performance Assessment will be linked to health plan profit. Quantifiable measures are grouped into three performance areas: Clinical Quality, Customer Services, and Resource Use (collectively termed QCR). The QCR measures consist of Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) and Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) measures. The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) oversees the set of HEDIS and CAHPS measures which is used nationwide to measure performance of health plans in various areas. OPM is using NCQA’s national or regional benchmarks in the FEHB Plan Performance Assessment.  </p>
<p>To focus attention on priority issues, OPM has developed a hierarchy for the QCR measures. In assigning priority levels to measures, OPM considered whether the measure assessed health outcomes, supported specific OPM policy priorities, and was relevant to FEHB subpopulations with particular health needs. Improvement on these high priority measures will indicate improved quality and carrier focus on critical healthcare areas for the FEHB Program.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This assessment system directly supports Goal 9 of the 2014-2018 OPM Strategic Plan by requiring that FEHB health plans meet rigorous industry standards and higher levels of health plan accountability. These higher standards and increased accountability lead to higher quality health benefits available to federal employees, federal retirees, their families, and newly eligible populations. This new initiative is also closely aligned with the current Administration’s goal of health care system improvement and parallels other federal agency and private payer processes.</p>

<p>Continue enhancing the security of OPM's information systems by strengthening authentication and expanding the implementation of continuous monitoring.</p>
<p>OPM will increase the use of multi-factor strong authentication in multiple ways.  While OPM enforces Personal Identity Verification (PIV) authentication for its internal users, OPM targets PIV usage for OPM services at 50 percent of Federal users by the end of FY 2016.  By the end of FY 2017, OPM will enforce multi-factor authentication for 100 percent of all PIV-enabled users and 80 percent of non-PIV-enabled users.</p>
<p>OPM will increase its security posture by expanding the Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) capabilities throughout FY 2015.  Leveraging the Continuous Diagnostic and Mitigation (CDM) program, OPM will expand continuous diagnostic capabilities by increasing the network sensor capacity, automating sensor collections, and prioritizing risk alerts.  By the end of the second quarter of FY 2016, OPM will have acquired, implemented, and refined the four (4) CDM controls including vulnerability management, secure configuration management, hardware asset management, and software asset management.  These tools will increase OPM’s ability to identify and respond to security issues.  By the end of FY 2016, 95 percent of OPM’s assets will be visible in the CDM dashboard.  In FY 2017, OPM will use the benchmarking results to identify and prioritize the implementation of other ISCM controls.</p>
<p>OPM will continue to pursue a number of additional actions as outlined in its Cybersecurity Monitoring goal.</p>

<p>OPM stores more Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and other sensitive records than almost any other Federal agency.  This is a tremendous trust placed in the agency by the millions of current and former Federal employees, and one that OPM must continually earn through constant vigilance.</p>
<p>The prior breaches of OPM data make clear that cybersecurity must remain a priority for all agencies, but especially OPM.  As President Obama has said, “Both state and non-state actors are sending everything they’ve got at trying to breach these systems…And this problem is not going to go away.  It is going to accelerate.  And that means that we have to be as nimble, as aggressive, and as well-resourced as those who are trying to break into these systems.”</p>
<p> In a world of evolving threats, there is no such thing as “total cybersecurity.”  But the actions outlined by OPM, and continued collaboration with Federal partners, Congress, and outside experts, will ensure that OPM has the tools it needs to safeguard its systems and protect our nation’s citizens and the men and women that serve the Federal Government.</p>
<p>This goal aligns with Administration cybersecurity priorities. The goal was established in coordination with OMB policies and guidance, to include the Cybersecurity Strategy and Implementation Plan (CSIP), the Fiscal Year 2015-2016 Guidance on Federal Information Security and Privacy Management Requirements, and the Cybersecurity CAP goal.</p>

<p>In FY 2016, process 90 percent of cases in 60 days or less (as of March 2015, 81.6 percent of cases were processed in 60 days or less).  Support the 90/60 goal by:</p>

                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is responsible for the administration of the Federal Retirement Program covering more than 2.7 million active employees and nearly 2.6 million annuitants. This responsibility is shared with agency partners who counsel their employees and administer the initial retirement application process, and submit the employee’s application, with all supporting documentation, to OPM’s Retirement Services.   OPM remains committed to improving all areas of retirement case related production by refining and implementing Lean Six Sigma process improvement activities, providing needed training and development, and diverting resources to areas needing concentrated efforts. In order to make comprehensive improvements to retirement claims processing, OPM will continue to focus on the following four pillars: People; Productivity and Process Improvement; Partnerships with Agencies; and Partial, Progressive IT Improvements.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Reducing Federal retirement case processing supports OPM’s Strategic Goal 7 - ensuring that Federal retirees receive timely, appropriate, transparent, seamless, and accurate retirement benefits. This Agency Priority Goal is aligned with Strategy 7.03 - advancing the 21st Century customer-focused retirement processing system for claims adjudication in a timely and accurate manner.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One challenge that OPM faces is the unexpected surges in normal retirement and phase retirement applications. When agencies make Voluntary Early Retirement Authority (VERA) and Voluntary Separation Incentive Program (VSIP) offers, OPM may see a significant increase in retirement applications. OPM works closely with agencies to understand upcoming retirement offers; however, surges in retirement applications can occur outside of OPM’s control and predictions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>OPM must also continue to address the accuracy and completeness of claims received. To do this, OPM conducts agency audits and provides follow up training to identify and address barriers to timely processing. A high level snap shot of this information is posted to the OPM website on a monthly basis, and a detailed report is provided to the CHCOs for each agency. When the retirement claim submissions are accurate and complete, processing is much faster. However, when data elements are missing, OPM must request the documentation necessary to process the request—a significant time and labor burden which contributes to OPM’s inability to quickly process its current or new inventory.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Another challenge that the agency faces is the diversity of cases OPM receives, which often leads to complex claims adjudication. Court-ordered benefits claims, as an example, typically involve legal documentation from multiple attorneys. Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) may seem simple, with OPM's responsibility simply to multiply the high-three average salary by a percentage based upon years of service. The reality is that both CSRS and FERS are extraordinarily complicated structures with a multitude of complex provisions that apply under various circumstances.</p>

</p>
                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>In alignment with OPM FY 2014-2018 Strategic Plan Goal 8.0, OPM provides personnel background investigative services to determine individuals’ suitability for Federal civilian, military, and contract employment and eligibility for access to classified national security information. OPM performs these background investigations for Federal agencies on a fee-for-service basis and conducts more than 95 percent of all background investigations for the Federal Government.  The timeliness provisions of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 and the Director of National Intelligence continue to be a key focus of the background investigations program.  OPM will continue efforts to complete the fastest 90 percent of all initial national security investigations initial within an average of 40 days, and the fastest 90 percent of all initial Top Secret investigations within an average of 80 days, and the fastest 90 percent of all initial Secret/Confidential investigations within an average of 40 days, as required by the Director of National Intelligence.  However, when the agency decided in FY 2014 not to renew the terms of one of its key investigative contractors, OPM’s Federal Investigative Services was challenged to continue to provide high-quality background investigations in a timely manner to its Federal agency customers with far fewer and less experienced contractor resources. </p>
<p>In 2015, in light of increasing cybersecurity threats, including the compromise of information housed at OPM, the interagency Suitability and Security Clearance Performance Accountability Council (PAC) conducted a 90-Day Suitability and Security review to re-examine reforms to the Federal background investigations process, assess additional enhancements to further secure information networks and systems, and determine improvements that could be made to the way the Government conducts background investigations for suitability, security and credentialing. As a result of that review, a new Federal entity, the National Background Investigations Bureau (NBIB), would be established to create a more secure and effective Federal background investigations infrastructure. On October 1, 2016, the NBIB began operation with the critical mission to deliver efficient and effective background investigations to safeguard the integrity and trustworthiness of the Federal workforce.  OPM stood up the NBIB without interruption to the crucially important investigative services OPM is tasked with providing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The NBIB will strengthen current and future investigative delivery, enhances stakeholder engagement, facilitates innovation, and engages both the Federal and private sectors in providing feedback, setting priorities, and ensuring continuous improvement. Some of the highlights of the NBIB include (1) an interagency detailee program to enable NBIB ready access to national security expertise from across Government and to expand ongoing interagency participation in the NBIB decision making process and operational activities, (2) a Business Transformation Directorate to increase the use of data, analytics, technology and innovative solutions to improve the quality and timeliness of processes, and (3) improvements to OPM’s existing customer service with expanded functions.  In September 2016, OPM named Charles S. Phalen, Jr. as the Director of the NBIB. </p>
<p>In addition, the NBIB will be accountable to the PAC and the NBIB’s customer agencies for providing continuous improvements to the investigative process.  The PAC and the Performance Improvement Council will also develop, implement, and continuously re-evaluate and revise outcome-based metrics that measure the effectiveness of the entire vetting processes, including investigations.  By the end of calendar year 2016, mechanisms and measures for continuous improvements to the investigative process will be identified and incorporated into subsequent APG updates.  </p>

<p>While OPM has made significant progress on timeliness since 2004, the agency has maintained its primary focus on delivering top quality products to agencies. OPM will work with its executive branch reform partners to develop and implement Executive Branch quality standards, with a measurement tool designed for universal application during both the investigative and adjudicative processes. OPM will focus on implementing these additional initiatives while maintaining timeliness objectives.  OPM will satisfy all national security standards, deliver quality products, and achieve Congressional and DNI mandated timeliness goals.</p>
<p>OPM is sensitive to the fiscal environment and the need for customer agencies (i.e., the employing or sponsoring agencies) to have more insight into the costs of background investigations. To this end, OPM will continue conducting business efficiency studies and maturing its cost allocation model to provide more detailed cost data and to optimize the value of OPM’s investigative products to agency adjudicators, which in turn translates into better value to taxpayers.</p>

<p>OPM is implementing an FEHB Health Plan Performance Assessment project to measure and reward all FEHB plan performance (experience-rated and community-rated) through the use of common, objective, and quantifiable performance measures by the 2016 plan year.  This will be a new approach to our assessment of the annual performance of health plans contracted under the program.  The performance assessment framework will include a discrete set of qualitative and quantifiable performance measures that will be used to assess key aspects of performance.  That overall assessment will then be linked to health plan profit factors.  There are four primary categories of health plan performance to be assessed:  clinical quality, customer service, resource use, and contract oversight.</p>
<p>Industry standards state that, in private employer plans, as much as 10 percent of health claim benefits paid are incurred by family members who are not eligible for coverage.  The FEHB Program provides approximately 23 billion dollars in benefits annually for those covered under Self and Family enrollments. This may translate to approximately 23 million dollars for each percent paid in error. Under current FEHB procedures, agencies and the FEHB carriers both have responsibility for family member eligibility determinations. However, there is no evidence that family member eligibility is systematically verified at the time of the initial enrollment, when enrollment is changed during Open Season or upon experiencing a Qualifying Life Event (QLE) (although some agencies do require documentation for QLE changes) or at any time during the employee’s period of coverage.  With the advent of electronic enrollment systems, enrollees can make certain FEHB enrollment changes without submitting any proof to their agency benefit officers.</p>
<p>The extent of ineligible family members covered under FEHB Self and Family enrollments is currently unknown. In addition, presently there is no centralized FEHB enrollment system to maintain a database of eligible enrollees and family members. Enrollment systems that currently exist do not require the input of family member dependent information. Thus, there is no centralized database of the FEHB enrollments and consequently, no mechanism to determine who is receiving benefits under any one Self and Family enrollment.</p>

The initiative is being implemented in two phases, described below. OPM has designated closing Human Resources Skills Gaps, one of several focus areas under this initiative, as a 2014-2015 OPM Priority Goal.</p>
<p>Phase I created a Government-wide strategic workforce planning method through which agencies and the Chief Human Capital Officers Council (CHCOC) could identify occupations and competencies where staffing gaps could jeopardize the ability of the Government or specific agencies to accomplish their missions.  Agencies and the CHCOC used this common method to identify occupations and competencies for skills gaps closure.  Based on this analysis, the CHCOC identified six mission critical occupational groups and seven competencies, requiring government-wide focus.  The six occupational groups are Cybersecurity, Acquisition, Economist, Human Resources, Auditor and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics).  The seven competencies are strategic thinking, problem solving, data analysis, influencing/negotiating, grants management, grants management compliance, and grants financial management.  Successful skills gaps closure is critically dependent on a strong HR workforce who can provide strategies, programs and tools that help occupational leaders design and implement skills gaps closure efforts.  For this reason, OPM designated HR Skills Gaps as an Agency Priority Goal.</p>
<p>In Phase II, OPM has designated a sub-goal leader for each of the six occupational groups to assist OPM in identifying potential pilot projects through which effective skill gaps strategies could be explored in order to design a comprehensive skills gap closure strategy.  OPM’s Associate Director for Employee Services has served as the sub-goal leader for HR Skills Gaps Closure.  He chairs the CHCOC HR Skills Gaps Working Group, which meets monthly to set the direction for skills gap closure, provides research and design support, and makes recommendations to the CHCOC.</p>

</ol><p>In support of the Diversity goal, OPM seeks to improve applicant flow reporting to enable human resources staff and hiring managers to determine whether recruitment efforts have been successful in drawing from all segments of society and to aid in developing future recruitment strategy.  Applicant flow data has historically been collected on the basis of race, national origin, and sex, and beginning in 2014, it will be collected on the basis of disability.  Historically, the data has been analyzed in an aggregate format; however, through the use of business intelligence tools, applicant flow data for individual hiring actions will be available for review at the hiring manager level after a vacancy has closed, creating incentive for increased hiring manager involvement in the recruitment process and greater opportunity for planning future recruitment efforts.</p>
<p>To further understand how to create an inclusive work environment where employees are fully engaged and productive, OPM and the Department of Veterans Affairs conducted factor analysis on the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey and found that twenty questions cluster into five areas or behaviors (i.e., fair, open, cooperative, supportive, and empowering) that create inclusive work environments.   Based on these five areas, OPM developed the “New IQ” (Inclusion Quotient) techniques and training to assist managers and supervisors in practicing behaviors that foster inclusion, an antecedent to employee engagement.  OPM will also continue to focus on the life cycle of the Federal employee to ensure that the Federal workforce is able to hire and develop the best talent from all segments of society, with a focus on internal Diversity and Inclusion efforts to ensure that we serve as a model agency.  Internal efforts will focus on the implementation of a data-driven, habit formation strategy that leverages first-line managers and supervisors to foster inclusion and engagement in the OPM workplace.</p>
