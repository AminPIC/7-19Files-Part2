                    <p>With America's involvement in Afghanistan winding down, there is a large influx of returning Service members and veterans transitioning to civilian life. To better support all Service members, DoD transformed its Wounded Warrior Agency Priority Goal from Fiscal Years 2012-2013 to an Agency Priority Goal (APG) focused on Transition to Veterans.  Transition to Veterans is a top DoD priority, and the Department wants to ensure our men and women in uniform are fully equipped for life after their military Service.</p>
<p>To that end, the Department has identified four programmatic goals that best reflect transition to veterans.  These goals include: By September 30, 2015 DoD  will improve the career readiness of Service Members’ transitioning to Veteran status by:  1)  ensuring at least 85% of eligible Service Members complete required transition activities prior to separation: pre-separation counseling, a Department of Labor (DoL) employment workshop, and Veterans Affairs’ benefits briefings; 2) verifying that at least 85% of separating service members meet  newly established Career Readiness Standards prior to separation; 3)  accelerating the transition of recovering Service Members into Veteran status by reducing disability evaluation processing time; and 4)  supporting the seamless transition of recovering Service Members by sharing active recovery plans with the VA.</p>

            <div class="">
                <p>Our Nation should provide the best support possible to those who keep our country free and strong as they transition to civilian life, especially during this time of planned structural reorganizations within the Department of Defense (DoD).   To this end, the DoD is partnering with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the Department of Labor, the Small Business Administration and the Department of Education, to ensure that all Service members participate in an effective program of pre-separation planning and education through evidence-based learning.  This support is delivered through a new curriculum, Transition GPS (Goals, Plans, Success), within the Department’s Transition Assistance Program (TAP).</p>
<p>The Department is also taking steps to accelerate the transition of Wounded, Ill, and Injured Service Members into Veteran status by reducing disability evaluation processing time   The Department is incorporating feedback from Service members and quality assurance reviews of disability determinations in addition to monitoring disability processing timeliness to better streamline the Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES) process.  DoD is also collaborating with VA to eliminate duplicate work, and share medical examination and disability ratings to produce faster, more consistent determinations. To this end, the Department established an overall performance measure consisting of timeliness for specific phases within the IDES, Service member satisfaction with the IDES, and quality objectives measuring the accuracy and consistency of IDES disability determinations.  The Department will actively monitor and track performance against these measures to ensure DoD performance goals are met.</p>
<p><strong>Key barriers and </strong><strong>challenges:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Securing TAP resources for both the DoD and interagency partners to meet statutory and DoD policy requirements.</li>
<li>Consolidating multiple Federal and private-sector websites into a single portal that offers resume building, military to civilian skills translation, and connections between Service members and employers.</li>
<li>Achieving full accountability for delivery of Transition GPS, given the variety of systems and data collection methods that must be integrated to verify completion of mandatory pre-separation activities and training.</li>
<li>Mission requirements often take priority over transition activities; full integration across the military lifecycle requires a cultural shift for both Service Members and Commanders.</li>
<li>DoD and VA are joint partners in the IDES, and both Departments' ability to meet IDES’ goals depends on the other's performance.</li>
<li>The IDES process still relies on paper case files; an electronic case management system is under development.</li>
<li>Delays in the proposed rating and benefits decision process increase IDES process cycle time.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives</strong></p>
<p>This goal supports the Department’s mission through Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) 2010 Goal #4: Preserve and Enhance the All-Volunteer Force. There are also four supporting performance measures:</p>
<ul><li>Require Service Members to attend pre-separation workshops and counseling sessions prior to separation:
<ul><li>Separation VOW Compliance (Active Duty) (5.6.1-2T5)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Create a Career Readiness Standard for Service Members prior to separation:
<ul><li>Separation Career Readiness Standards (Active Duty) (5.6.2-2T5)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Accelerate the transition of Wounded, Ill and Injured Service Members into Veteran status by reducing the disability evaluation processing time:
<ul><li>Percent of Wounded, Ill, or Injured Service Members who meet DoD IDES core process cycle time and satisfaction goals (4.1.3-2M)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Increase the use of Recovery Care Coordinators and ensure recovering Service Members have active recovery plans:
<ul><li>Percentage of recovering Service Members enrolled in Wounded Warrior Programs with Active Recovery Plans that are shared with the VA to aid in successful transition (4.1.4-2M)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>                            </div>

            <div class="">
                <p><strong>Implementation Strategy:</strong></p>
<p>In order to ensure transitioning Service members are optimally prepared for transition to civilian employment, the Department has redesigned its Transition Assistance Program (TAP) and instituted Career Readiness Standards The redesigned TAP features a revised curriculum known as Transition GPS (Goals, Plans, Success), which is comprised of both core instructional blocks and individually selected tracks for accessing higher education, for  obtaining career technical training, and for entrepreneurship. Career Readiness Standards, an integral component of the new TAP, ensure all Service Members are “career ready” prior to separation by requiring verification that every Service Member has been provided appropriate instruction, completed career readiness activities, such as development of an Individual Transition Plan, and, where appropriate, established contact with partner agencies (e.g., the VA, provides essential benefits and services post-separation).  The  Transition GPS curriculum is evaluated quarterly during participant assessments so that it may continually evolve to best meet Service Member needs.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Department of Defense is leading a government-wide effort to help Service members receive appropriate credit for their military training through credentials and licenses.  In this effort, the Department is cooperating with other federal agencies, state governments, professional organizations, and affinity groups.</p>
<p>The final phase of the redesigned TAP integrates transition preparation throughout a Service member's military career.  The Department has designated training and touch points along the Service member's career path. This allows the member time and resources to plan their civilian career goals and to prepare for a smooth transition from the military. This Military Lifecycle TAP will be fully implemented by the end of FY2015.</p>
<p>With regard to the Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES), DoD uses survey feedback from Service members in the process, results of quality assurance reviews evaluating the performance of personnel conducting disability determinations, and the timeliness of the IDES process to help accelerate the transition of Wounded, Ill, and Injured Service Members into Veteran status.</p>
<p>DoD continues to work with the VA to accelerate the transition of Service members to veteran status and receipt of VA benefits.  Since December 2012, DoD has downloaded over 17,000  DD Form 214’s (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Service) from the Defense Personnel Records Information Retrieval System (DPRIS) and uploaded them into Virtual VA to assist the VA in completing final benefit determinations for recently discharged Service members.</p>
<p>Additionally, in the area of information technology enhancements, DoD is acquiring a DoD Disability Evaluation System Information Technology (IT) solution, with a targeted Initial Operating Capability in Fiscal Year 2017.  This system(s) will leverage existing IT capabilities where appropriate, and include new capabilities to support end-to-end case management, tracking, reporting, and electronic IDES case file transfer that will significantly reduce the administrative time used to manually process cases through the IDES.</p>
<p>Efficiencies:</p>
<ul><li>Improving the DoD disability evaluation program enables DoD to identify sooner wounded, ill, or injured Service members who will be able to return to duty, as well as Service members who, due to physical or mental disability, should be separated or discharged. </li>
<li>DoD developed the capability to simulate IDES caseload demand, resource requirements, and the effect of process changes on the disability evaluation system to better analyze and predict the impact of potential resource or operational changes.</li>
<li>The  DoD  provides Unemployment Compensation (UCX) to unemployed veterans who meet eligibility criteria.  Efforts to improve transition assistance may result in long term cost savings through UCX payments, if they result in a drop in Post 9/11 Veteran unemployment.  However, it is important to note that any relationship between pre-separation training and UCX payments is obscured by many other variables.  While noteworthy from a contextual perspective, UCX payments cannot be treated as a direct reflection of the effectiveness of TAP.</li>
</ul><p>The Office of the Deputy Chief Management Officer/Planning, Performance &amp; Assessment (ODCMO/PPA) engaged the goal owner of this measurement (OUSD (P&amp;R)) about the overall theme (specific discussion regarding milestones and indicators will occur soon).</p>

            <h2>Progress Update</h2>
            <div>
                <p><u><strong>DOD 2015 Transition to Veterans - Goal Attainment Statement</strong></u></p>
<p>The Department of Defense has made great progress towards achieving the “Transition to Veteran” agency priority goal.   In 2015, the four performance indicators associated with this goal performed at planned levels of performance or better.  As DOD reflects on the VOW to Hire Act of 2011 and other initiatives established to ensure our Nation’s Service men and women successfully transition to civilian life, we have determined that continued attention is needed to ensure lasting success for this priority goal.  We continue to assess the performance indicators and will make appropriate adjustments as we implement policies and practices that focus on career readiness and supporting Service members and their families.</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Some key accomplishments in FY2014 and FY2015 to date include:</p>
<ul><li>Full implementation of the Capstone process to verify that all Service members have met Career Readiness Standards prior to separation.  Career Readiness Standards are now verified by Commanders or their designees with an Individual Transition Plan Checklist.  Service members who have not met all standards are placed in contact with a representative from an agency partner (e.g., VA) during a “warm handover” for follow-on support. (Second quarter FY2014)</li>
<li>Formalization of an interagency governance structure for transition services through a signed Memorandum of Understanding on January 31, 2014 between DoD, VA, DoL, the Department of Homeland Security, ED, SBA, and OPM, establishing a framework for an ongoing partnership to improve Service member career readiness. (Second quarter FY2014)</li>
<li>Development of a Military Life Cycle Implementation Plan, which was submitted to the White House in April 2014.  The plan explains the purpose and guiding principles of the Military Life Cycle model, describes common “touch points” and associated career readiness preparation activities within a Service member’s military career, and presents specific implementation plans for each of the military Services and the VA.  The Military Life Cycle model is scheduled for full implementation by the end of FY 2014 throughout all military Services and the U.S. Coast Guard. (Second quarter FY2014)</li>
<li>Received Materiel Development Decision to begin acquisition of a DoD Disability Evaluation System IT solution, with a targeted Initial Operating Capability in Fiscal Year 2017.  Working in coordination with the Military Departments, the DES IT solution will enable the Department to leverage existing IT capabilities where appropriate, and include new capabilities to support end-to-end case management: tracking, reporting, and electronic case file transfer that will significantly reduce the administrative time used to manually process cases through the IDES. In December 2013, DoD tested an interface between electronic Case File Transfer (eCFT) and the VA Data Access Service (DAS), which allowed transfer of files electronically to the VA.  (First quarter FY2014)</li>
<li>Formalization of an interagency TAP evaluation strategy, integrating evaluation information from DoD, VA, DoL, SBA, ED, and OPM to provide accountability for program delivery and improve customer satisfaction and effectiveness.  This strategy includes pre- and post-separation assessments, clear performance measures, and quality assurance standards to ensure customer satisfaction, program accountability, and programmatic effectiveness. The strategy was briefed to OMB in May 2014. (Third quarter FY2014)</li>
<li>Conducted a thorough review of and revision to the Transition GPS Participant Assessment tool to improve the quality of the tool as a customer satisfaction feedback mechanism for the TAP.  The revised assessment is now in use, effective July 1, 2014. (Third quarter FY2014).</li>
<li>Formation of a Curriculum Evaluation Working Group, including membership from VA, DOL, SBA, ED, and the military Services.  This group gathered and reviewed participant and facilitator feedback and informed an update to the Transition GPS curriculum. The DoD curriculum updates, intended to refine training in response to Service member feedback, was completed during third quarter and will be in use at the military installations and online via Joint Knowledge Online starting Q1 of FY15. (Third quarter FY2014).</li>
<li>Established minimum standards for training program content and performance objectives for Physical Evaluation Board Liaison Officers (PEBLOs) to ensure that Service members receive the best possible counseling and support while in the DES.  (Fourth quarter FY2015)</li>
<li>Delivery of 10 additional “train the trainer” courses for TAP facilitators. Courses were provided in various CONUS and OCONUS locations to 140 facilitators. (Fourth quarter FY2014)</li>
<li>Implementation of the Military Life Cycle (MLC) TAP delivery model providing services at designated “touch points” throughout a Service Member’s MLC. (Fourth quarter FY2014).</li>
<li>Development of FY2015 Staff Assistance Visit (SAV) Action Plan and Guide, with new focus on the Military Life Cycle (MLC). The SAVs are a component of the Inter-Agency TAP Evaluation Strategy, providing accountability to ensure the TAP is effectively and efficiently executed in accordance with statute, executive orders, agency policy, and leadership intent. (Fourth quarter FY2014).</li>
<li>Development of a more reliable system, built upon using the DD Form 2958 as the form of record, to provide accurate performance information regarding compliance with pre-separation requirements and completion of Career Readiness Standards. Upon initial implementation of the system, gaps remained in data collection and transmission processes. DoD coordinated closely with Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) and the Services to identify and remove barriers to collecting and transmitting data. For example, DMDC and the Transition to Veteran Program Office staff began conducting week-long site visits to identify and troubleshoot challenges in data collection, upload, and transmission of the DD Form 2958 (Service Member Career Readiness Standards/Individual Transition Plan Checklist) data at the Installation-level. Significant progress was made in identifying and rectifying identified barriers (Fourth quarter FY2014)</li>
<li>Developed and launched “Operation TAP,” a strategic communications campaign, designed to increase overall awareness of the redesigned TAP, ensure leadership understanding, and educate targeted audiences on key elements of the program.  The campaign was launched across all military installations (CONUS and OCONUS) throughout the month of September 2014. (Fourth quarter FY2014)</li>
<li>Published updated DoD policy issuances, combining thirteen previous issuances and directive-type memoranda for Legacy and Integrated DES enabling the Military Departments to work from a much improved set of policy documents. (Fourth quarter 2014)</li>
<li>All Military Services reported to the Whited House that the Military Lifecycle (MLC) transition preparation was fully implemented at their installations. (First quarter FY2015)</li>

For 2014-Q3, the verified actual values from DMDC were solely used.  Data collection processes for this new measure are immature and continue to evolve.  While recent progress has been made to standardize and automate data collection, known data gaps and delays persist, particularly in the Reserve Component.  This obscures the true extent to which the Transition Assistance Program (TAP) is being delivered in accordance with the VOW Act.  The DoD is actively working with the Military Departments and DMDC to ensure that required TAP services are being delivered, identify the causes of data gaps, and enable Service TAP offices to more easily and accurately report completion of pre-separation counseling and course attendance. Progress is being made as a result of these efforts.</p>

Note that this percentage is likely an underrepresentation of the true performance on this measure, as the data collection processes were not in place across all installations at the beginning of FY2014 (and this is a cumulative measure across the FY). Upon initial implementation of the system, data collection and transmission processes were immature.  To remedy this, DoD coordinated closely with DMDC and the Services to identify and remove barriers to collecting and transmitting data. For example, DMDC and TVPO staff began conducting week-long site visits to identify and troubleshoot challenges in data collection, upload, and transmission of the DD Form 2958 data at the Installation-level. Significant progress was made in identifying and rectifying identified barriers.</p>
