                <p>For more than 200 years, the State Department has focused its diplomatic engagement on other governments – and done so successfully.  But since the late 20th century, international relations have not been about ties between governments.  The growth of new democracies, shifts in culture, rise of the middle class worldwide, and advances in technology have resulted in the diffusion of power from governments to citizens.  Even in autocratic societies, leaders must increasingly respond to the opinions and actions of their people.  Today, international relations are increasingly about the links between societies rather than governments.</p>
<p>Civil society can be a catalyst for social, political, and economic progress.  Civic groups mobilize people and resources to fight disease and hunger.  They work to strengthen rule of law and promote accountability and transparency.  They are also critical to economic development, because in our global economy, trade and investment flow to countries that give citizens the freedom to create and develop new ideas.  Labor organizations are essential to set a floor on labor standards in a globalized marketplace.  Strong civil societies uphold universal human rights and provide care to victims.  Political systems that protect universal rights are more stable, successful, and secure.  For the United States, strengthening and protecting civil society is not just a matter of good global citizenship; it is a more effective and efficient path to advancing key foreign policy objectives.</p>
<p>In September 2013, President Obama launched a “Stand with Civil Society” agenda aimed at bolstering civil society throughout the world and pushing back on the growing restrictions on it.  As part of this agenda, the White House established an interagency process to coordinate overarching U.S. government policy on opening and safeguarding civic space.</p>
<p>The State Department and USAID continue to make efforts to strengthen and protect civil society, promote participatory and inclusive political processes, and increase connections between Americans and people around the world – through efforts ranging from public service and educational exchanges to increased commerce and public-private partnerships.  As a matter of policy, we oppose restrictions on civil society and engage when governments try to stifle civic activism.  Through USAID and State programming, we strengthen the legal environment for civil society, promote politically engaged and informed citizenries, help develop open and sustainable media sectors, and support independent and democratic trade or labor unions.  We integrate religious engagement as a crucial element of our bilateral and multilateral efforts to promote religious tolerance, in line with the NSS Strategy for Integrating Religious Leader and Faith Community Engagement into U.S. Foreign Policy.  We use technology and multi-stakeholder engagement to advance Internet freedom and strengthen civil society’s ability to serve, advocate, and organize.  And we provide civil society, independent media organizations, bloggers, and advocates with mentoring, tools, and techniques to enhance their advocacy skills, bolster their information technology capabilities, and protect their security, both online and offline.  At a time of budget austerity and growing restrictions on foreign assistance, we also work to foster domestic philanthropy abroad and address legal impediments to charitable giving.</p>
<p><strong>Strategies for Achieving the Objective</strong></p>
<p>The State Department and USAID have developed new capabilities and partnerships that expand our capacity for engagement with civil society, and implement programs and policies to foster vibrant civic ecosystems worldwide. USAID is also working with local grassroots civil society organizations in an effort to increase local capacity.</p>
<p>The State Department is enhancing its people-to-people exchange programs and elevating youth issues as a policy priority. The State Department’s youth policy led to the creation of a Special Adviser on Global Youth Issues and an Office of Global Youth Issues, and has exponentially expanded our outreach to young people around the world via direct engagement by diplomatic posts, exchange programs, virtual classrooms, and social media. Through these efforts, the United States is building ties to young professionals and emerging leaders in a global economy.</p>
<p>The Department of State engages a full range of tools, including diplomacy, foreign assistance and public-private partnerships, to optimize the Open Government Partnership (OGP) as a vehicle to support civic participation and make government more responsive, effective, and accountable. </p>
<p>The U.S. government also funds a broad range of technical assistance programs supporting civil society, including programs that track and monitor legislation that restricts the work of civil society in more than 40 countries. The Department works through the Community of Democracies to coordinate diplomatic responses to actions, including pending legislation abroad, that threaten civil society or could increase restrictions on the freedoms of association, assembly, and expression, online and offline. We also work multilaterally to provide targeted technical assistance to Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) and partner with 18 other governments and foundations through the <em>Lifeline. Embattled CSOs Assistance Fund </em>to offer emergency financial assistance when civic groups are threatened.</p>
<p>Defending Internet freedom is a central component of U.S. support for civil society, both through diplomatic efforts and the expenditure of over $120 million in programming funds to date. For example, the United States supports the Digital Defenders Partnership, which provides emergency assistance for activists, bloggers, citizen journalists, and common citizens who have been harassed, threatened, or arrested for exercising their human rights online.  This Partnership has also invested millions to strengthen civil society’s capacity to advocate for laws and policies that facilitate unfettered Internet access. We support the development of technologies for activists in highly repressive environments and provide training to protect activists in these environments from harm. In developing countries, we strengthen civil society role in Internet policymaking and support their participation in global Internet governance.  The Department of State and USAID will continue to strengthen civil society by providing training and offering tools for success while also working with partners in the philanthropic community to encourage domestic philanthropy and volunteerism abroad.</p>
<p>External factors, including competing U.S. geopolitical priorities, budgetary constraints on our foreign assistance, austerity measures by partner governments, and a lack of political will from like-minded partners to engage systematically, could impede our progress in advancing this objective.</p>

                  <h2>Progress Update</h2>
                  <div>
                      <p>In 2014, an increasing number of governments inhibited the free operation of civil society and cut off CSOs ability to receive funding from legitimate sources, including foreign funding.  In some cases, these restrictions arose out of the implementation of laws, regulations, and administrative measures that were being inappropriately applied; in other cases, the laws, regulations, and administrative measures by authoritarian governments were themselves problematic.  This closing space for civil society is increasingly becoming a global development challenge.  Governments have also become increasingly adept at sharing “worst practices” for cracking down on CSOs.  The United States and a growing number of like-minded governments continued efforts to address this problem through President Obama’s <em>Stand With Civil Society</em> initiative, which mobilizes international like-minded partners to work together to combat increasing restrictions to civil society globally.</p>
<p>Although efforts to assist CSO are extremely important, successes have been rare and fragile. Libya's fledgling government consulted closely with civil society during the creation of its draft NGO law, but increasing recent governance and security challenges, particularly threats to civil society actors as well as administrative measures, have overshadowed the legislation process.  One area of success – in terms of promoting consultative lawmaking - has been the recent passage in Burma of the Association Registration Law (ARL), which lays out regulations for the formation and registration of local and international NGOs.  Through a combination of diplomatic engagement and foreign assistance, the U.S. government helped support the ARL’s public consultation process, which has been lauded by outside observers.</p>
<p>In September, President Obama deepened U.S commitment to <em>Stand with Civil Society</em> by issuing a Presidential Memorandum directing all U.S. agencies engaged abroad to strengthen and protect civil society.  The Department has worked through the White House’s Stand With Civil Society interagency process to:  (1) produce a menu of options for posts facing existing and prospective threats to civil society; (2) identify, in consultations with the regional bureaus, countries where the United States might intensify its efforts; and (3) set up an intranet site to which posts can share information on both the challenges they are facing and opportunities that exist despite those challenges.  The Department also greatly increased the number of accredited NGOs which can participate at the UN.</p>
<p>OGP has grown from eight participating countries in 2011 to 65 countries today and over 2,000 commitments that affect over 1.5 billion people.  However, government engagement of civil society as partners in developing and implementing transformative open government reforms has varied among OGP’s participants.  The Department will utilize the full range of tools available to encourage participating countries to fully engage civil society in developing national action plans that meaningfully advance transparent, accountable government.  We will also support the implementation of a one-year pilot Rapid Response mechanism that addresses when participating countries fail to uphold the values and principles of inclusive, transparent, and accountable government. </p>
<p>The Department is committed to providing core funding for the Community of Democracies (CD) to strengthen the architecture for global diplomatic action when governments are considering new laws, regulations, or administrative measures that restrict civil society in a manner inconsistent with their international obligations and commitments.  This funding will also help CD facilitate expert consultations and dialogue with civil society representatives from repressive environments.  We are also supporting an effort that enables CD governments and organizations to pool resources and co-finance projects that strengthen civil society and democracy worldwide—the CD-UNITED.  The State Department continues diplomatic and financial support for Lifeline: Embattled CSOs Assistance Fund, a multilateral initiative in which the United States participates.  Looking forward, additional U.S. funding to Lifeline will augment emergency assistance available to CSOs under threat and deliver more coordinated diplomatic engagement in priority countries.</p>
<p>Responding to the President's <em>Stand with Civil Society</em> agenda, USAID has:  (1) expanded the CSO Legal Enabling Environment Program to work on improving the legal environment for civil society, and to respond to threatening restrictions; (2) provided critical mentoring to civil society organizations on how to assess and manage their digital security risks; (3) explored developing a new, innovative model to support civil society in restrictive environments through regional hubs; (4) partnered with USAID Regional Development Mission in Asia to develop a new Nonprofit Management Program at a Thai University; and (5) supported innovation grants, scale-up, and research to empower citizens to engage with government to voice their concerns and demands, and enable governments to respond through Making All Voices Count, a $55 million partnership with the United Kingdom, Sweden Omidyar Network, and the Open Society Foundation.</p>
<p>The Department of State’s Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) program is a regionally-focused effort that empowers citizens in the Middle East and North Africa to develop more pluralistic, participatory, and prosperous societies. In FY 2013, MEPI provided assistance to over 800 CSOs engaged in community activism and made 91 grants directly to local organizations throughout the region. Through these awards, individuals across the region volunteered in their communities, identified issues of public concern and presented these to public officials. </p>

                      <p>For more than 200 years, the State Department has focused its diplomatic engagement on other governments – and done so successfully.  But since the late 20th century, international relations have not been about ties between governments.  The growth of new democracies, shifts in culture, rise of the middle class worldwide, and advances in technology have resulted in the diffusion of power from governments to citizens.  Even in autocratic societies, leaders must increasingly respond to the opinions and actions of their people.  Today, international relations are</p>                      <span class="read-more"><a href="#">Read More...</a></span>                  </div>

                      <p>For more than 200 years, the State Department has focused its diplomatic engagement on other governments – and done so successfully.  But since the late 20th century, international relations have not been about ties between governments.  The growth of new democracies, shifts in culture, rise of the middle class worldwide, and advances in technology have resulted in the diffusion of power from governments to citizens.  Even in autocratic societies, leaders must increasingly respond to the opinions and actions of their people.  Today, international relations are increasingly about the links between societies rather than governments.</p>
<p>Civil society can be a catalyst for social, political, and economic progress.  Civic groups mobilize people and resources to fight disease and hunger.  They work to strengthen rule of law and promote accountability and transparency.  They are also critical to economic development, because in our global economy, trade and investment flow to countries that give citizens the freedom to create and develop new ideas.  Labor organizations are essential to set a floor on labor standards in a globalized marketplace.  Strong civil societies uphold universal human rights and provide care to victims.  Political systems that protect universal rights are more stable, successful, and secure.  For the United States, strengthening and protecting civil society is not just a matter of good global citizenship; it is a more effective and efficient path to advancing key foreign policy objectives.</p>
<p>In September 2013, President Obama launched a “Stand with Civil Society” agenda aimed at bolstering civil society throughout the world and pushing back on the growing restrictions on it.  As part of this agenda, the White House established an interagency process to coordinate overarching U.S. government policy on opening and safeguarding civic space.</p>
<p>The State Department and USAID continue to make efforts to strengthen and protect civil society, promote participatory and inclusive political processes, and increase connections between Americans and people around the world – through efforts ranging from public service and educational exchanges to increased commerce and public-private partnerships.  As a matter of policy, we oppose restrictions on civil society and engage when governments try to stifle civic activism.  Through USAID and State programming, we strengthen the legal environment for civil society, promote politically engaged and informed citizenries, help develop open and sustainable media sectors, and support independent and democratic trade or labor unions.  We integrate religious engagement as a crucial element of our bilateral and multilateral efforts to promote religious tolerance, in line with the NSS Strategy for Integrating Religious Leader and Faith Community Engagement into U.S. Foreign Policy.  We use technology and multi-stakeholder engagement to advance Internet freedom and strengthen civil society’s ability to serve, advocate, and organize.  And we provide civil society, independent media organizations, bloggers, and advocates with mentoring, tools, and techniques to enhance their advocacy skills, bolster their information technology capabilities, and protect their security, both online and offline.  At a time of budget austerity and growing restrictions on foreign assistance, we also work to foster domestic philanthropy abroad and address legal impediments to charitable giving.</p>
<p><strong>Strategies for Achieving the Objective</strong></p>
<p>The State Department and USAID have developed new capabilities and partnerships that expand our capacity for engagement with civil society, and implement programs and policies to foster vibrant civic ecosystems worldwide. USAID is also working with local grassroots civil society organizations in an effort to increase local capacity.</p>
<p>The State Department is enhancing its people-to-people exchange programs and elevating youth issues as a policy priority. The State Department’s youth policy led to the creation of a Special Adviser on Global Youth Issues and an Office of Global Youth Issues, and has exponentially expanded our outreach to young people around the world via direct engagement by diplomatic posts, exchange programs, virtual classrooms, and social media. Through these efforts, the United States is building ties to young professionals and emerging leaders in a global economy.</p>
<p>The Department of State engages a full range of tools, including diplomacy, foreign assistance and public-private partnerships, to optimize the Open Government Partnership (OGP) as a vehicle to support civic participation and make government more responsive, effective, and accountable. </p>
<p>The U.S. government also funds a broad range of technical assistance programs supporting civil society, including programs that track and monitor legislation that restricts the work of civil society in more than 40 countries. The Department works through the Community of Democracies to coordinate diplomatic responses to actions, including pending legislation abroad, that threaten civil society or could increase restrictions on the freedoms of association, assembly, and expression, online and offline. We also work multilaterally to provide targeted technical assistance to Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) and partner with 18 other governments and foundations through the <em>Lifeline. Embattled CSOs Assistance Fund </em>to offer emergency financial assistance when civic groups are threatened.</p>
<p>Defending Internet freedom is a central component of U.S. support for civil society, both through diplomatic efforts and the expenditure of over $120 million in programming funds to date. For example, the United States supports the Digital Defenders Partnership, which provides emergency assistance for activists, bloggers, citizen journalists, and common citizens who have been harassed, threatened, or arrested for exercising their human rights online.  This Partnership has also invested millions to strengthen civil society’s capacity to advocate for laws and policies that facilitate unfettered Internet access. We support the development of technologies for activists in highly repressive environments and provide training to protect activists in these environments from harm. In developing countries, we strengthen civil society role in Internet policymaking and support their participation in global Internet governance.  The Department of State and USAID will continue to strengthen civil society by providing training and offering tools for success while also working with partners in the philanthropic community to encourage domestic philanthropy and volunteerism abroad.</p>
<p>External factors, including competing U.S. geopolitical priorities, budgetary constraints on our foreign assistance, austerity measures by partner governments, and a lack of political will from like-minded partners to engage systematically, could impede our progress in advancing this objective.</p>

<p>The United States works to promote and protect universal human rights worldwide, including an individual’s right to be free from slavery and involuntary servitude, to speak one’s own mind, to assemble without fear, to believe or not to believe in a religion, and to choose his or her own leaders.  Those rights also include dignity, tolerance, and equality among all people, including ethnic and racial minorities; religious minorities; women; youth; indigenous persons; displaced persons; stateless persons; persons with disabilities; and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people.  Internationally recognized labor rights are enshrined in the 1998 ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.</p>
<p>We are working with international partners to reverse the troubling trend of increasing restrictions on the freedoms of association and assembly, especially restrictions on civil society organizations, and to combat violence against religious minorities.  We are broadening and diversifying multi-stakeholder initiatives that provide support for civil society organizations and human rights defenders, especially those under threat.</p>
<p>Through our partnerships with governments, civil society, human rights defenders, and the private sector, the State Department and USAID seek:  the repeal or non-enforcement of discriminatory laws around the world; the adoption of inclusive, rights-respecting legal frameworks in societies in transition; enhanced respect for human rights and accountability within security forces, including the prevention of and response to gender-based violence; justice and accountability for gross human rights violations and atrocities; accountability for perpetrators of human trafficking, including forced labor, sex trafficking, and child soldiering, and protection of victims; and workers’ rights, including combating the worst forms of child labor and discrimination.  We will continue our focus on advancing the ability of people worldwide to exercise freely their universal human rights through new technologies, safely, and without fear of retribution.  We will also continue to work with civil society and business partners to promote responsible business conduct in ways that reinforce our human rights objectives.</p>

<p>The United States works to promote and protect universal human rights worldwide, including an individual's right to be free from slavery and involuntary servitude, to speak one's own mind, to assemble without fear, to believe or not to believe in a religion, and to choose his or her own leaders.  Those rights also include dignity, tolerance, and equality among all people; including ethnic and racial minorities, religious minorities, women, youth, indigenous persons, displaced persons, stateless persons, persons with disabilities, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people.  Internationally-recognized labor rights are enshrined in the 1998 International Labor Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.</p>
<p>The U.S. government is working with international partners to reverse the troubling trend of increasing restrictions on the freedoms of expression, association and assembly, civil society organizations, and violence against religious minorities.  The U.S. government is broadening and diversifying multi-stakeholder initiatives that provide support for civil society organizations and human rights defenders, especially those under threat.</p>
<p>In September 2013, President Obama launched <em>Stand with Civil Society</em>, a global call to action to support, defend, and sustain civil society amid a rising tide of restrictions on its operations globally.  Working in partnership with other governments, the philanthropic community, and multilateral initiatives, the U.S. government has focused on three lines of effort over the past year:  (1) promoting laws, policies, and practices that foster a supportive environment for civil society in accordance with international norms; (2) coordinating multilateral, diplomatic pressure to push back against undue restrictions on civil society; and (3) identifying innovative ways of providing technical, financial, and logistical support to promote a transparent and vibrant civil society.  The U.S. government is the largest supporter of civil society in the world, with more than $2.7 billion invested to strengthen civil society since 2010.</p>
<p>Through U.S. partnerships with governments, civil society, human rights defenders, and the private sector, the Department of State and USAID seek:  (1) the repeal or non-enforcement of discriminatory laws around the world; (2) the adoption of inclusive, rights-respecting legal frameworks in societies in transition; (3) enhanced respect for human rights and accountability within security forces, including the prevention of and response to gender-based violence; (4) justice and accountability for gross human rights violations and atrocities; (5) accountability for perpetrators of human trafficking – including forced labor, sex trafficking, and child soldiering – and protection of victims; and (6) workers' rights, including combating the worst forms of child labor and discrimination.  The U.S. government will continue its focus on advancing the ability of people worldwide to exercise freely their universal human rights through new technologies, safely, and without fear of retribution.  </p>
<p>The U.S. government will also continue to work with civil society and business partners to promote responsible business conduct in ways that reinforce our human rights objectives.</p>

</p>
                                          <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>The United States supports the expansion of democracy abroad because countries with freely elected, accountable governments contribute to a freer, more prosperous, and peaceful world.  Democracies are our strongest partners on security, trade, energy, and the environment, in peace and conflict.  Our support for democratic ideals supplies a lifeline for individuals striving for change, and is our greatest strength in combating violent extremism.  Democratic governments work with the United States to build consensus and solve problems on the global stage.  Their respect for the pluralism of ideas, inclusiveness, and vibrant civil societies leads to innovation and entrepreneurship that benefits all.</p>
<p>The United States works to promote and institutionalize the foundations of democratic accountability around the world – free and fair electoral processes, strong legislatures, rights-respecting constitutions and legal frameworks, civilian control of militaries, a vibrant private sector, and a robust civil society with independent NGOs and labor unions, and a free and independent media – online and off.  Democratic accountability also requires accountable civilian police, independent and fair judiciaries, commitment to proactively investigate and prosecute human rights violators, including human traffickers, and humane corrections systems.  Through diplomacy and development, we seek to end impunity and foster greater accountability of institutions and leaders to the people and the law.  We promote fiscal transparency to improve accountability and citizens’ understanding of economic governance and fiscal policy choices.  We encourage governments to pursue anti-corruption measures and thereby build accountability and support for democracy.</p>
<p>The United States works to build and sustain the capacity for all members of society, including women and under-represented groups, to participate fully in the democratic process and in the strengthening of democratic institutions.  We encourage consensus building, and we promote the right of individuals, NGOs, and other civil society organizations to peacefully exercise their rights of expression, association, and assembly.</p>
<p>We support the leadership of emerging democracies as they assume a more active role in advancing basic human rights and democratic values in their regions and globally.  In nascent or fragile democracies, we support governments and civil society as they build and strengthen institutions necessary for democratic development, rule of law, and delivery of tangible improvements for their people.  And in closed or restrictive societies, we support civil society, particularly human rights defenders and independent media.</p>
<p>The State Department and USAID work in concert with those seeking democratic outcomes and make clear that we cannot have the same close relationship with those who deny their own people’s voice.  We will make clear that all people should have a say in how they are governed, that governments should be the collective power of the citizenry, and that leaders draw their legitimacy from those they govern.  And we will emphasize the importance of including all members of society regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, gender, caste, disability, or sexual orientation.  We reaffirm our commitment to encourage democratic governance as a force for stability, peace, and prosperity.</p>
<p><strong>Strategies for Achieving the Objective </strong></p>
<p>Only the people of a nation can truly bring about sustainable democracy. U.S. senior officials engage publicly and privately with citizens in countries eager for progress and those burdened by non-democratic forms of governance.  The U.S. government pushes back on attempts to dismantle democratic institutions, and works with like-minded governments such as:  the United Nations (UN), particularly the Human Rights Council; the UN General Assembly Third (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Affairs) Committee; and the UN Special Rapporteurs.  The U.S. government also engages regional mechanisms such as the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and Organization of American States; and intergovernmental organizations like the Community of Democracies to advance democratic ideals and to deter backsliding by governments.  Working with U.S. implementers and directly with local non-governmental organizations (NGOs), U.S. programs build the capacity of government institutions and officials pressing for democratic progress and transparency, and empower citizens and NGOs.  The U.S. government works to ensure that civil society continues to demand government accountability, transparency, and services, and engages in their respective political systems.  The U.S. government promotes fiscal transparency to improve accountability and citizens’ understanding of economic governance and fiscal policy choices.  The U.S. government supports rigorous program evaluations to identify promising, effective democratization strategies and to conduct needs assessments and other research to guide program decisions.  U.S. rapid response funds and flexible foreign assistance funding mechanisms allows the United States to intercede as unforeseen backsliding or opportunities arise.</p>
<p>Many factors could affect achievement of these goals.  Democratic progress can take decades, and setbacks are common.  It is difficult to quantify our impact in accomplishing our diplomatic objectives or our medium to longer-term programmatic impact, because success may not be apparent for years and is often the result of the efforts by many contributors.  There will be voices that challenge and impede our multilateral democracy and human rights efforts.</p>
<p>In the short-term, authoritarian non-rights-respecting governments may oppose the U.S. public stance or describe U.S. engagement with opposition parties or civil society as interference.  These governments may balk at democracy-building measures and threaten to delay agreements or progress on other priorities, be they security, political, or economic priorities. Consistent engagement is necessary for success.</p>
