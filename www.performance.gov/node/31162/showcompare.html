As we work together, our relationships must continue to be based on integrity, trust, and shared accountability to make the most effective use of our respective bodies of knowledge, our existing authorities, our resources, and our talents.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Successful partnerships will be based on four working principles: consultation, collaboration, cooperation, and accountability. By <em>consulting</em>, we will engage our partners in a timely fashion as we consider approaches to our environmental work so that each partner can make an early and meaningful contribution toward the final result. By <em>collaborating</em>, we will not only share information, but we will actively work together with our partners to develop innovative approaches that use and leverage all available resources to achieve our environmental and human health goals. As our work progresses, we will <em>cooperate</em>, viewing each other with respect as allies who must work successfully together if our goals are to be achieved. Through shared <em>accountability,</em> we will ensure that environmental benefits are consistently delivered nationwide. In carrying out these responsibilities, EPA will ensure that state, tribal, and federal implementation of federal laws achieves a consistent level of protection for the environment and human health.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>With States</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Under our federal environmental laws, EPA and the states share responsibility for protecting human health and the environment. With this relationship as a key component of the nation's environmental protection system, EPA will:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Improve implementation of national environmental programs through closer consultation and collaboration to seek the most efficient use of resources, streamline business processes and administrative requirements, develop and promote innovative solutions, and further our shared governance framework by revitalizing the National Environmental Performance Partnership System (NEPPS).[1] We will strengthen joint EPA-state priority setting by better aligning NEPPS with EPA’s national program manager guidances[2], focusing on flexible, innovative approaches to achieve results, and seek ways to leverage all available mutually beneficial opportunities to share work and expertise.</li>
<li>Work collaboratively with state partners to develop innovative strategies and modernize our environmental programs through the E-Enterprise initiative[3], a 21<sup>st</sup> century approach that will support the nation’s environmental protection responsibilities through enhanced information sharing, increased transparency, and reduced regulatory burden, supported by advanced monitoring tools and information technologies.</li>
<li>Consult with state governments early in the rule-making process to ensure that the development and implementation of rules is consistent with “EPA’s Action Development Process: Guidance on Executive Order 13132 (Federalism),” which recognizes the division of governmental responsibilities between the federal government and the states.</li>
<li>Strengthen state-EPA shared accountability by focusing oversight on the most significant and pressing state program performance challenges, using data and analysis to accelerate program improvements.</li>
<li>Ensure a level playing field across states to improve compliance and address the most serious violations.</li>
<li>Collaborate with state research organizations to share information on EPA’s scientific and technical capabilities and solicit input to make our tools, models, and research useful and practical for the states in carrying out their environmental responsibilities.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong>With Tribes</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The relationship between the United States government and federally-recognized tribes is unique—we work with tribes on a government-to-government basis on Agency decisions that may affect tribal interests. Our responsibility to consult with tribal governments is distinct from the general consultations we have with states and nations outside the U.S. border. As such, our consultations with tribes are governed by the EPA Policy for the Administration of Environmental Programs on Indian Reservations (November 8, 1984), Executive Order 13175 on Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments, and the Agency’s Policy on Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribes (May 4, 2011). In strengthening this relationship with tribes, EPA will:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Focus on increasing tribal capacity to establish and implement environmental programs while ensuring that our national programs are as effective in Indian country as they are throughout the rest of the nation.[4]</li>
<li>Enhance our effort to work with tribes on a government-to-government basis, based upon the Constitution, treaties, laws, executive orders, and a long history of Supreme Court rulings.</li>
<li>Strengthen our cross-cultural sensitivity with tribes, recognizing that tribes have cultural, jurisdictional, and legal features that must be considered when coordinating and implementing environmental programs in Indian country.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong>With Local Partners</strong>:</p>
<p>EPA has a unique relationship with local governments given that local governments can be both co-implementers and regulated entities under national and state environmental laws. Recognizing that local governments vary considerably[5], are dealing with significant resource constraints as they work to build capacity (particularly in smaller communities), and often provide innovative leadership in environmental stewardship, EPA will:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Maintain consistent and meaningful communications with local officials and optimize outreach efforts to improve environmental program implementation at the local level and receive recommendations on environmental issues that are important to local governments.</li>
<li>Consult with local governments, as with states, early in the development of rules and policies that impact them, consistent with “EPA’s Action Development Process: Guidance on Executive Order 13132 (Federalism).”</li>
<li>Promote and facilitate best practices among local officials to address pressing local environmental matters with flexible, innovative approaches that advance shared priorities.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong>With International Partners</strong></p>
<p>To achieve our domestic environmental and human health goals, international partnerships, including those with the business community and entrepreneurs, are essential. Pollution is often carried by winds and water across national boundaries, posing risks to human health and ecosystems many hundreds and thousands of miles away. Many concerns, like climate change, are global and, to address these and other environmental challenges in the international arena, EPA will:</p>
<ul><li>Enhance sustainability principles through expanded partnership efforts in multilateral forums and in key bilateral relationships.</li>
<li>Strengthen existing and build new international partnerships to encourage increased international commitment to sustainability goals and to promote a new era of global environmental stewardship based on common interests, shared values, and mutual respect.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>End Notes:</p>
<ol><li>NEPPS is an environmental performance system established in 1995 and designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of state environmental programs and EPA-state partnerships. It is a system of principles and tools to drive performance, efficiency, and flexibility in the EPA-state relationship. It enables EPA and states to leverage their collective resources most efficiently and effectively by taking full advantage of the unique capacities and capabilities of each partner to achieve the maximum environmental and human health protection. The primary tools for establishing priorities and deploying resources are Performance Partnership Agreements (PPAs) and Performance Partnership Grants (PPGs). PPGs allow states and tribes to combine categorical grants for greater spending flexibility on state and tribal priorities. PPAs are strategic negotiated plans that articulate joint goals and priorities, key activities, and roles and responsibilities.</li>
<li>EPA’s national program manager (NPM) guidances translate the Agency’s budget decisions into operational program priorities, strategies, and performance measures. Issued by the five major environmental programs (air, water, waste, chemical safety and pollution prevention, and enforcement and compliance assurance), the NPM guidances inform the development of EPA work plans and grant agreements with states and tribes, including Performance Partnership Agreements, Performance Partnership Grants, and/or programmatic grants.</li>
<li>EPA has developed an FY 2014-2015 Agency Priority Goal for E-Enterprise: Improve environmental outcomes and enhance service to the regulated community and the public. By September 30, 2015, reduce reporting burdens to EPA by one million hours through streamlined regulations, provide real-time environmental data to at least two communities, and establish a new portal to service the regulated community and public. More information on Agency Priority Goals is available at <a href="http://goals.performance.gov/agency/epa">http://goals.performance.gov/agency/epa</a>.</li>
<li>EPA recently issued new guidance for the Indian Environmental General Assistance Program, “Guidance on the Award and Management of General Assistance Agreements for Tribes and Intertribal Consortia,” May 15, 2013. The General Assistance Program (GAP) Guidance is designed to enhance the EPA-tribal partnership by establishing a framework for joint strategic planning, identification of mutual responsibilities, and targeting resources to build tribal environmental program capacities.

As we work together, our relationships must continue to be based on integrity, trust, and shared accountability to make the most effective use of our respective bodies of knowledge, our existing authorities, our resources, and our talents.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Successful partnerships will be based on four working principles: consultation, collaboration, cooperation, and accountability. By <em>consulting</em>, we will engage our partners in a timely fashion as we consider approaches to our environmental work so that each partner can make an early and meaningful contribution toward the final result. By <em>collaborating</em>, we will not only share information, but we will actively work together with our partners to develop innovative approaches that use and leverage all available resources to achieve our environmental and human health goals. As our work progresses, we will <em>cooperate</em>, viewing each other with respect as allies who must work successfully together if our goals are to be achieved. Through shared <em>accountability,</em> we will ensure that environmental benefits are consistently delivered nationwide. In carrying out these responsibilities, EPA will ensure that state, tribal, and federal implementation of federal laws achieves a consistent level of protection for the environment and human health.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>With States</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Under our federal environmental laws, EPA and the states share responsibility for protecting human health and the environment. With this relationship as a key component of the nation's environmental protection system, EPA will:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Improve implementation of national environmental programs through closer consultation and collaboration to seek the most efficient use of resources, streamline business processes and administrative requirements, develop and promote innovative solutions, and further our shared governance framework by revitalizing the National Environmental Performance Partnership System (NEPPS).[1] We will strengthen joint EPA-state priority setting by better aligning NEPPS with EPA’s national program manager guidances[2], focusing on flexible, innovative approaches to achieve results, and seek ways to leverage all available mutually beneficial opportunities to share work and expertise.</li>
<li>Work collaboratively with state partners to develop innovative strategies and modernize our environmental programs through the E-Enterprise initiative[3], a 21<sup>st</sup> century approach that will support the nation’s environmental protection responsibilities through enhanced information sharing, increased transparency, and reduced regulatory burden, supported by advanced monitoring tools and information technologies.</li>
<li>Consult with state governments early in the rule-making process to ensure that the development and implementation of rules is consistent with “EPA’s Action Development Process: Guidance on Executive Order 13132 (Federalism),” which recognizes the division of governmental responsibilities between the federal government and the states.</li>
<li>Strengthen state-EPA shared accountability by focusing oversight on the most significant and pressing state program performance challenges, using data and analysis to accelerate program improvements.</li>
<li>Ensure a level playing field across states to improve compliance and address the most serious violations.</li>
<li>Collaborate with state research organizations to share information on EPA’s scientific and technical capabilities and solicit input to make our tools, models, and research useful and practical for the states in carrying out their environmental responsibilities.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong>With Tribes</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The relationship between the United States government and federally-recognized tribes is unique—we work with tribes on a government-to-government basis on Agency decisions that may affect tribal interests. Our responsibility to consult with tribal governments is distinct from the general consultations we have with states and nations outside the U.S. border. As such, our consultations with tribes are governed by the EPA Policy for the Administration of Environmental Programs on Indian Reservations (November 8, 1984), Executive Order 13175 on Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments, and the Agency’s Policy on Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribes (May 4, 2011). In strengthening this relationship with tribes, EPA will:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Focus on increasing tribal capacity to establish and implement environmental programs while ensuring that our national programs are as effective in Indian country as they are throughout the rest of the nation.[4]</li>
<li>Enhance our effort to work with tribes on a government-to-government basis, based upon the Constitution, treaties, laws, executive orders, and a long history of Supreme Court rulings.</li>
<li>Strengthen our cross-cultural sensitivity with tribes, recognizing that tribes have cultural, jurisdictional, and legal features that must be considered when coordinating and implementing environmental programs in Indian country.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong>With Local Partners</strong>:</p>
<p>EPA has a unique relationship with local governments given that local governments can be both co-implementers and regulated entities under national and state environmental laws. Recognizing that local governments vary considerably[5], are dealing with significant resource constraints as they work to build capacity (particularly in smaller communities), and often provide innovative leadership in environmental stewardship, EPA will:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Maintain consistent and meaningful communications with local officials and optimize outreach efforts to improve environmental program implementation at the local level and receive recommendations on environmental issues that are important to local governments.</li>
<li>Consult with local governments, as with states, early in the development of rules and policies that impact them, consistent with “EPA’s Action Development Process: Guidance on Executive Order 13132 (Federalism).”</li>
<li>Promote and facilitate best practices among local officials to address pressing local environmental matters with flexible, innovative approaches that advance shared priorities.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong>With International Partners</strong></p>
<p>To achieve our domestic environmental and human health goals, international partnerships, including those with the business community and entrepreneurs, are essential. Pollution is often carried by winds and water across national boundaries, posing risks to human health and ecosystems many hundreds and thousands of miles away. Many concerns, like climate change, are global and, to address these and other environmental challenges in the international arena, EPA will:</p>
<ul><li>Enhance sustainability principles through expanded partnership efforts in multilateral forums and in key bilateral relationships.</li>
<li>Strengthen existing and build new international partnerships to encourage increased international commitment to sustainability goals and to promote a new era of global environmental stewardship based on common interests, shared values, and mutual respect.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>End Notes:</p>
<ol><li>NEPPS is an environmental performance system established in 1995 and designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of state environmental programs and EPA-state partnerships. It is a system of principles and tools to drive performance, efficiency, and flexibility in the EPA-state relationship. It enables EPA and states to leverage their collective resources most efficiently and effectively by taking full advantage of the unique capacities and capabilities of each partner to achieve the maximum environmental and human health protection. The primary tools for establishing priorities and deploying resources are Performance Partnership Agreements (PPAs) and Performance Partnership Grants (PPGs). PPGs allow states and tribes to combine categorical grants for greater spending flexibility on state and tribal priorities. PPAs are strategic negotiated plans that articulate joint goals and priorities, key activities, and roles and responsibilities.</li>
<li>EPA’s national program manager (NPM) guidances translate the Agency’s budget decisions into operational program priorities, strategies, and performance measures. Issued by the five major environmental programs (air, water, waste, chemical safety and pollution prevention, and enforcement and compliance assurance), the NPM guidances inform the development of EPA work plans and grant agreements with states and tribes, including Performance Partnership Agreements, Performance Partnership Grants, and/or programmatic grants.</li>
<li>EPA has developed an FY 2014-2015 Agency Priority Goal for E-Enterprise: Improve environmental outcomes and enhance service to the regulated community and the public. By September 30, 2015, reduce reporting burdens to EPA by one million hours through streamlined regulations, provide real-time environmental data to at least two communities, and establish a new portal to service the regulated community and public. More information on Agency Priority Goals is available at <a href="http://goals.performance.gov/agency/epa">http://goals.performance.gov/agency/epa</a>.</li>
<li>EPA recently issued new guidance for the Indian Environmental General Assistance Program, “Guidance on the Award and Management of General Assistance Agreements for Tribes and Intertribal Consortia,” May 15, 2013. The General Assistance Program (GAP) Guidance is designed to enhance the EPA-tribal partnership by establishing a framework for joint strategic planning, identification of mutual responsibilities, and targeting resources to build tribal environmental program capacities. Additionally, it augments existing GAP Guidance with a guidebook of program development indicators, providing “pathways” for capacity building and ways to measure development of programs over time.</li>
<li>Local governments may include counties, cities, water districts, air districts, ports, municipal waste management associations, economic development councils, metropolitan councils of government, and other entities.</li>

The General Assistance Program (GAP) Guidance is designed to enhance the EPA-tribal partnership by establishing a framework for joint strategic planning, identification of mutual responsibilities, and targeting resources to build tribal environmental program capacities. Additionally, it augments existing GAP Guidance with a guidebook of program development indicators, providing “pathways” for capacity building and ways to measure development of programs over time.</li>
<li>Local governments may include counties, cities, water districts, air districts, ports, municipal waste management associations, economic development councils, metropolitan councils of government, and other entities.</li>

</p>
                                          <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>Environmental regulators face ever growing needs to share information within and across agencies, reduce staff burden of data entry, reduce regulatory reporting burdens, and improve environmental and human health protection. There is also an increasing expectation from the public and regulated community for the use of on-line systems and the desire for data transparency and personalized access. Both federal and state agencies recognize that easier access to and use of environmental data will facilitate better environmental protection and decision-making while also increasing overall data transparency.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Consistent with the 2012 White House Digital Government Strategy and Executive Order 13563, EPA seeks to transform the way business is conducted. E-Enterprise for the Environment is a joint initiative of states and EPA to improve environmental outcomes and enhance service to the regulated community and the public by maximizing the use of advanced monitoring and information technologies, optimizing operations, and increasing transparency. E-Enterprise will enable new environmental management approaches by modernizing EPA programs and regulations while streamlining and improving existing business processes. E-Enterprise will use the transformational capabilities of information and advanced monitoring technologies to identify and implement programmatic and service improvements.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>These improvements will include “smart” tools and services that guide the regulated community in understanding and fulfilling their federal, state and, local regulatory reporting obligations, offer basic validations and error checking of entered information, and support electronic signature submissions. E-Enterprise projects that take advantage of tools and practices such as advanced monitoring technology and streamlined data collection will also expand the ability of the government, regulated entities, and the public to see and measure pollutant discharges, emissions and environmental conditions. A fundamental premise of E-Enterprise is that providing a more complete and integrated (cross media - air, water, and land) view of environmental data can support greener behavior of the public and regulated entities. For example, broad availability of high-speed internet allows real-time reporting of emissions and provides unprecedented opportunities for transparency and public involvement in matters affecting local environmental conditions. These technological advances will allow better tracking of environmental progress. Innovative technology can also help regulators improve compliance with environmental laws.</p>
