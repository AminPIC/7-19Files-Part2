            <div class="">
                <p>This Priority Goal advances the Strategic Plan objective to address climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the strategic measure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from light duty vehicles and is a continuation of the FY 2012/2013 Priority Goal.  The FY 2012/2013 Priority Goal focused on the implementation of the first light-duty vehicle standards (Model Years (MY) 2012-2016) and heavy-duty standards (MY 2014-2018) to address greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from transportation activities, which accounted for 27% of U.S. GHG emissions in 2010, with the largest source being from passenger cars, light-duty trucks and freight trucks.  The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report, “Adapting to the Impacts of Climate Change,” indicates that climate change is associated with increased flooding, prolonged drought, more severe heat waves, more frequent wildfires, and changes in wetland, forest, and grassland habitats. These events result in substantial economic consequences through the contamination of drinking water resources, impaired air and water quality and reduced capacity of ecosystems to provide the services to society that we depend upon.</p>
<p>It is important to continue this APG because both the light-duty (MY 2012-2016) and heavy-duty vehicle rules are in the early stages of implementation, and the real benefits of these rules will not be realized until later years. For light-duty rules, the implementation for vehicles started in 2012, and will ramp up each year until 2025. For the heavy-duty rule, EPA is in the early credit earning phase, and will start in 2014/2015 to implement the first standards and assess compliance for the 2014 model year. The next phase includes incorporating the GHG standards in the light-duty vehicle rule for model years 2017-2025 (finalized in August 2012) and transitioning from the voluntary early credit earning phase (i.e., credit banking/trading, off-cycle credits, air-conditioning improvement credits) of the heavy-duty rule to the implementation phase of the 2014 model year standards.</p>

            <!--<div class="teaser collapsed">

            <div class="">
                <p><strong>Ensure that Light-duty Vehicles Comply with the GHG Standards: </strong>EPA’s primary role will be to ensure overall compliance with the GHG standards.  This consists of certifying new light-duty vehicles as meeting the standards, receiving and reviewing manufacturer final GHG reports to ensure that manufacturers meet their vehicle fleet requirements, monitoring manufacturer credit balances and deficits for several years after the close of the model year, and ensuring that the certified GHG results are achieved under actual in-use operation.</p>
<p>In the MYs 2017-2025 light-duty standards, the EPA continued the same comprehensive program for averaging, banking, and trading of credits established in the MYs 2012-2016 program. Together, these provisions help manufacturers in planning and implementing the orderly phase-in of GHG-reducing technology in their production, consistent with typical redesign schedules. Credits may be carried forward, or banked for up to five years, or carried back three years to cover a deficit in a previous year. A manufacturer may transfer credits across all vehicles, both cars and light trucks, it produces. Trading of credits between companies is also permitted. To facilitate the transition to the increasingly more stringent MYs 2017-2025 standards, EPA also finalized a one-time CO2 credit carry-forward provision beyond 5 years, allowing credits generated from MYs 2010 through 2016 to be used through MY 2021.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Certify Light-Duty Vehicles</strong>:  The certification process involves the review of test data submitted from vehicle manufacturers to assure compliance with all applicable emissions standards for the vehicle’s useful life.  It also entails the review of additional information submitted in the application for vehicle certification on vehicle technology, test procedures and processes, durability demonstrations, and other regulatory requirements.  If any of the information is incomplete or questionable, EPA will follow up with the manufacturer to either clarify or fix the issue.  EPA technical staff conducts spot checks by testing pre-production certification vehicles for emissions and fuel consumption at the Agency’s National Vehicle and Fuels Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL).  If a vehicle fails EPA testing, the manufacturer must fix the problem before EPA issues a certificate.  All new vehicles sold in the U.S. need a valid EPA certificate regardless of where the vehicle was manufactured. Because CO2 emissions are highly sensitive to nuances in the way laboratory tests are conducted, EPA will need to scrutinize the calculations, assumptions, and algorithms manufacturers use to derive emission values and establish testing protocols. Accordingly, in the early implementation of any new program, including the Light-Duty Vehicle Rule, it is important for EPA to perform spot checks at a higher rate than under mature certification programs. Spot checks help EPA verify the accuracy of the data submitted by manufacturers during the certification process. A higher rate of these spot checks early in the implementation phase of the program provides EPA with a larger data set in which EPA uses to identify potential concerns, anomalies and make adjustments, where necessary to improve the implementation program.</li>
<li><strong>Ensure Manufacturer meets Fleet-Average Standard</strong>:  Unlike previous emission standards that set a specific threshold for a given pollutant, the GHG regulations establish production-based fleet-average standards.  Thus, full compliance will be assessed only after the close of the model year.  Manufacturers are required to submit final GHG reports to EPA at the end of each model year.  The purpose of the reports is to provide EPA with all the necessary data to determine whether the manufacturer is in compliance with the GHG standards.  This includes GHG test results for all of the various vehicle models, final vehicle production, and a detailed explanation of all credits used from this model year or a past model year, planned to be used from a future model year, or generated for future use.  To successfully implement the rule, EPA must exercise considerable management oversight of the credit program.  Determining whether manufacturers have complied with the rule ultimately depends on actual production and  data compiled and supplied to EPA by the manufacturers.  Once EPA receives these data at the end of a model year, the agency must factor in the credits generated by the manufacturers.  EPA requires several months to combine and analyze the sales and credit data to determine manufacturer compliance.</li>
<li><strong>Perform Quality Control on Vehicle Testing Procedures</strong>: To ensure that the emission results provided by manufacturers to demonstrate compliance with the GHG standards are achieved in-use, it is important that all of the vehicles tested in the laboratory are tested appropriately.  This includes examining whether vehicles are driven appropriately over the test cycles and that the vehicles are tested in a manner that appropriately represents the loads the vehicle would experience in actual operation on the road.  If vehicles are tested with loads that are not reflective of actual operation or do not properly follow the test cycle, actual in-use GHG emissions can be different than what manufacturers projected through the certification process.EPA has an ongoing testing program to test production vehicles at a test track to verify the road load estimates generated by manufacturers for laboratory testing.  This testing can also be used to determine if a manufacturer’s process for measuring and calculating these loads is robust or needs improvements.  Testing can only be performed at a test facility that has a test track capable of allowing vehicles to drive for over two miles non-stop in one direction.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong>Ensure that Heavy-duty Trucks Meet GHG Standards: </strong>As is the case for light-duty, EPA’s primary role will be to ensure overall compliance with the GHG standards.  This involves certifying new heavy-duty engines, and for the first time new heavy-duty vehicles, as meeting the standards.  The addition of heavy-duty vehicle standards introduces a new set of stakeholders, as some truck and other heavy-duty vehicle manufacturers were not previously subject to emissions regulations and are therefore not familiar with EPA compliance processes. In addition, the introduction of vehicle standards requires a new set of test procedures and test facilities capable of measuring emissions from large vehicles that operate under a very broad range of conditions.  Ensuring compliance will also require EPA to receive and review manufacturer final GHG reports to ensure that manufacturers maintain the necessary credit balances to comply with standards and to ensure that the certified GHG results are achieved under actual in-use operation.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Certify Heavy-duty Trucks</strong>:  The certification process involves the review of test data submitted from engine and vehicle manufacturers to assure compliance with all applicable emissions standards for the full useful life of the engine or vehicle.  It also entails the review of additional information submitted in the application for certification on vehicle technology, test procedures and processes, durability demonstrations, and other regulatory requirements.  If any of the information is incomplete or questionable, EPA will follow up with the manufacturer to either clarify or fix the issue.  EPA technical staff will manage review of data submissions for certification and ensuring fleet compliance with the GHG standards.</li>
<li><strong>Develop data system to support certification</strong>:  To implement the program, EPA must design, construct, and manage complex credit banking and trading program that allows manufacturers different pathways for demonstrating compliance with the fleet average standards.  The complexity of the credit program means that EPA will be establishing an electronic system for banking and trading that will assist EPA in tracking the different types of credits that carry forward and backward in time. This will require technical staff familiar with components of the certification program to develop data elements and business rules to support development of the data system.  Also, EPA serves as the sole source of collection for both GHG emissions data and fuel consumption data. As part of this development, EPA will automate sending the relevant data to National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA).</li>
<li><strong>Conduct confirmatory testing to verify manufacturer results</strong>: EPA technical staff will also conduct spot-checks for engine compliance through issuance of test orders to confirm the validity of manufacturer emission test results.  Tests will be conducted at the Agency’s National Vehicle and Fuels Emissions Laboratory, at contract facilities, or at the manufacturer’s facility as part of a broader lab audit.  If an engine fails EPA testing, the manufacturer will have to fix the problem before EPA issues a certificate.  All new engines sold in the U.S. need a valid EPA certificate regardless of where they were manufactured.  As EPA begins to implement the heavy-duty rule, we anticipate performing spot checks of engines at rates consistent with our existing compliance program for engine. Tests for greenhouse gases and criteria air pollutants can be run concurrently.This confirmatory testing for heavy-duty vehicle GHG compliance will differ from those used for engine compliance and light-duty vehicle compliance.  As opposed to conducting tests for GHG emissions on a complete vehicle, as is done with light-duty, testing for heavy-duty vehicles is performed only for specific variables that serve as inputs to EPA’s greenhouse gas emissions (GEM) model.  Compliance for heavy-duty vehicles is determined by validating the various inputs to the model, including aerodynamic drag and tire rolling resistance, through testing. While the heavy-duty GHG rule offers some voluntary early compliance options, emission standards under the heavy-duty rule do not become mandatory until the 2014 model year.  Therefore, the milestones EPA is projecting for the current goals cycle primarily address preparation and development rather than certification and compliance assessment activity.</li>

            <h2>Progress Update</h2>
            <div>
                <p>In EPA’s Action Plan and quarterly reports for FY 2015, we established quarterly milestones for both light-duty and heavy-duty standards that track critical actions in this phase of implementing the GHG standards.  The remainder of this report outlines our progress on Quarter 4 milestones, highlights challenges we faced, and explains strategic shifts, if any, that were made to address these challenges. </p>
<p><strong>4<sup>th</sup> Quarter, FY 2015</strong></p>
<p><em><u>Light-Duty GHG Standards</u></em></p>
<p>In our Action Plan and previous quarterly reports, we set the following milestones and targets for Q4 for light-duty GHG standards:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Continue issuing certificates for light-duty models that meet testing criteria.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confirmatory (spot check) test approximately 20-25 manufacturer pre-production certification vehicles to confirm their greenhouse gas emissions results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Begin compiling 2015 Model Year Performance Report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Annual target in FY 2015 for light-duty coastdown testing is 15-20 vehicles. Actual number of tests conducted per quarter will be dependent on a number of factors such as securing testing sites and weather conditions.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>For light-duty standards, we do not set targets for number of certificates issued because it is dependent on the number of requests submitted by manufacturers. However, we continue to issue light duty certificates in a timely manner and in pace with the numbers of requests that we receive.  In Q4 of FY 2015, we issued 208 light-duty certificates of conformity, and confirmatory tested 55 manufacturer pre-production certification vehicles to confirm their greenhouse gas emissions results. For the light duty coastdown surveillance testing, two vehicles were tested.  A draft of the 2014 Model Year performance report was completed. The report will be published in the first half of Fiscal Year 2016.</p>
<p><em><u>Heavy-Duty GHG Standards</u></em></p>
<p>In our Action Plan and previous quarterly reports, we set the following milestones and targets for Q4 heavy-duty GHG standards:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Continue issuing certificates for heavy-duty engines, vehicles, tractors and vocational trucks that meet all greenhouse gas requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deploy data system for certification for heavy-duty engines.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>For heavy-duty standards, we do not set targets for number of certificates issued because it is dependent on the number of requests submitted by manufacturers. However, we continue to issue heavy duty certificates in a timely manner and in pace with the numbers of requests that we receive. In Q4, EPA issued a total of 30 heavy-duty certificates of conformity.</p>
<p>The EPA is meeting the commitment to continue developing data systems for certification and end-of-year compliance calculations for heavy-duty tractors and vocational vehicles.  These systems will be used by the manufacturers for submitting required information and by EPA for assessing compliance with the GHG requirements. From July 2015 through September 2015, EPA continued developing greenhouse gas certification data systems. System development for the heavy-duty engine module was completed and the system was deployed in August. This module is part of the Verify System, a comprehensive data management system that facilitates EPA certification and compliance oversight and replaces the interim solutions that were developed when the heavy-duty greenhouse gas rule was promulgated.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Overall Results</strong></p>
<p>At the end of this two year goal period, the EPA successfully achieved its milestones for early implementation of the LD program and the optional early credit phase for heavy duty program. The earliest EPA vehicle and truck CO2 standards represent the first time that the Agency regulated greenhouse gas emissions. The scope of the GHG program and the requisite evolution of the vehicle and engine industries meant that EPA was working with stakeholders (truck, vehicle and engine manufacturers) that had varying levels of experience with EPA and with mobile source emissions compliance programs.  These circumstances required EPA to develop entirely new internal and external oversight and compliance capabilities. These early challenges continue as the program matures, particularly with respect to developing testing protocols and IT systems necessary to assist with reporting on the status of manufacturers’ compliance with the program.</p>
<p>In addition, the EPA successfully achieved its annual performance targets set for FY 2014 and FY 2015. As of September 30, 2015 EPA issued 1,706 certificates of conformity for vehicles and engines that complied with the requirements of both the LD and HD GHG programs, 331 manufacturer pre-production certification vehicles that were confirmatory (spot check) tested to confirm their greenhouse gas emissions results and values, and 35 production vehicles were surveillance tested at a test track to determine accuracy of manufacturer’s road load calculations. Over the two year goal period, we implemented the following key components of the LD and HD GHG vehicle program:</p>
<p><u>Light-Duty</u></p>
<ul><li>
<p>EPA continued the test program to test production vehicles at a test track to verify the road load estimates generated by manufacturers for laboratory testing. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EPA collected and analyzed light duty manufacturer submissions for GHG reports for 2012, 2013, and 2014 model years.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>EPA completed the 2013 Model Year performance report (published during the third quarter FY 2015)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EPA completed a draft of the 2014 Model Year performance report. The report will go out in the first half of Fiscal Year 2016.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EPA will begin compiling 2015 Model Year performance report.</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p><u>Heavy-Duty</u></p>
<ul><li>
<p>From October 2013 through September 2015, EPA continued developing greenhouse gas certification data systems. System development for the heavy-duty engine module and the system was deployed into production in August. This module is part of the Verify System, a comprehensive data management system that facilitates EPA certification and compliance oversight and replaces the interim solutions that were developed when the heavy-duty greenhouse gas rule was promulgated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EPA serves as the sole source of collection for both GHG emissions data and fuel consumption data.  EPA developed an automated process for transmitting fuel consumption data to DOT’s National Highway and Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) to allow them to implement portions of the joint HD rule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the Heavy-Duty Tractor and Vocational Vehicle Production Volume Reports we have also implemented a GEM validation feature which allows the Cert Reps to audit the manufacturers GEM values. To date, 6 manufacturers have submitted ABT reports and 1 manufacturer submitted a Production Volume report.</p>
</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong>Looking Ahead to FY 2016-2017</strong></p>
<p>The FY 2014-2015 APG focused on incorporating the light-duty GHG standards for model years 2017-2025 and transitioning from the voluntary early credit earning phase (i.e., credit banking/trading, off-cycle credits, air-conditioning improvement credits) to full implementation of the 2014-2018 heavy-duty rule. This Priority Goal is a continuation of the FY 2012-2013 APG, which focused on the implementation of the first light-duty vehicle standards (MY 2012-2016) and preparing for the implementation of heavy-duty standards (MY 2014-2018). It was important to continue this APG because both the light-duty (MY 2012-2016) and heavy-duty vehicle rules are in the early stages of implementation, and the real benefits of these rules will not be realized until later years.</p>
<p>Looking forward, the FY 2016-2017 APG will build upon the successes of the related FY 2014-2015 and FY 2012-2013 Agency Priority Goals.  The focus of the FY 2016-2017 APG will be on manufacturer compliance with the standards, the natural progression as the programs mature. EPA will continue to track issuing certificates and confirmatory testing but will also track new reporting metrics to capture compliance activities.</p>
<p>The EPA will also be facing new challenges associated with this new focus. The key challenges include management of the extensive effort required to develop the annual manufacturer’s performance report for the light duty program and, for the first time, developing a similar report for the heavy-duty program. These reports require EPA to track, analyze, and compile considerable amounts of compliance data and credit transactions reported by manufacturers for each model year and to ensure data accuracy and completeness of submissions. To date, EPA has issued three manufacturer’s performance reports for the early credit program (2009-2011 model years), the 2012 model year, and the 2013 model year under the light-duty program and continues to work on ways to effectively streamline the data collection, verification, and production of these reports. For the heavy duty program, EPA will break new ground as we build these reports from the reported manufacturer’s compliance data under varying program requirements and multiple program flexibilities.</p>

</p>
                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>EPA’s strategies to address climate change reflect the President’s call to action in his <em>Climate Action Plan</em> (June 2013), which, among other initiatives, tasks EPA with setting carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) standards for power plants and applying the Agency’s authorities and other tools to address hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and methane.  These strategies support the President's goal to reduce GHG emissions by 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020.[1]  EPA and its partners are developing and implementing approaches to reduce GHG emissions domestically and internationally through cost-effective, voluntary programs while pursuing additional regulatory actions as needed.  Our efforts address the following areas:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mobile Sources</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Implementing three sets of GHG standards for vehicles and trucks, including:  two sets of GHG standards for light-duty cars and trucks (model years 2012-2016 and 2017-2025); and the first set of standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks and buses (model years 2014-2018).  These emission standards, finalized jointly with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) fuel economy standards, will result in substantial reductions in new vehicle GHG emissions from model years 2012 through 2025.  (Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks is an FY 2014-2015 Agency Priority Goal.[2])</li>
<li>Carrying out the next phase of the GHG vehicle emission standards.  Consistent with the President’s <em>Climate Action Plan</em>, the Agency plans to propose in March 2015 a second phase of fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emission standards for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles for model years 2018 and beyond, and plans to finalize the standards in March 2016.  This second phase of regulations will build upon the success of the first phase and offer further opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and decrease transportation fuel consumption, and is expected to benefit consumers and business by reducing the cost of transporting goods while spurring job growth and innovation in the clean energy technology sector.</li>
<li>Assessing GHG control options for non-road sources, including evaluating whether and when to commence work on standards setting for GHG emissions from a wide range of non-road equipment, locomotives, marine vessels and aircraft, and transportation fuels.</li>
</ul><p>Stationary Sources</p>
<ul><li>Using authority under Section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act, EPA  issued a new proposal on September 20, 2013 for GHG performance standards for new power plants and will subsequently finalize that rule after consideration of public comment as appropriate.  Using authority under Sections 111(b) and 111(d) of the Act, EPA will issue proposed GHG standards, regulations, or guidelines, as appropriate, for modified, reconstructed, and existing power plants by June 1, 2014, and finalize these standards, regulations, or guidelines by June 1, 2015.</li>
<li>Collecting and publishing high-quality GHG emissions data from large direct emitters and suppliers of GHGs through the greenhouse gas reporting program to inform the public and support sound, data-driven, policy decisions on climate change.</li>
<li>Implementing permitting requirements for facilities that emit large amounts of GHGs to encourage design and construction of more sustainable, efficient, and advanced processes that will contribute to a clean energy economy.</li>
<li>Applying the Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) program to promote the use of low global warming potential HFCs and similar chemicals.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>International and Other Efforts</p>
<ul><li>Implementing proven voluntary programs that maximize GHG reductions through the greater use of technologies, products, and practices that promote energy efficiency, and renewables programs and policies that benefit the environment and human health.</li>
<li>Identifying and assessing substitute chemical and ozone-depleting substances and processes for their global warming potential.</li>
<li>Collaborating with countries and other international partners to reduce methane emissions and deliver clean energy to markets around the world through the Global Methane Initiative.</li>
<li>Collaborating with international partners to reduce short-lived climate pollutants, including methane, black carbon, and hydrofluorocarbons, through the Climate and Clean Air Coalition.</li>
<li>Educating the public about a changing climate and actions people can take to reduce GHG emissions.</li>
<li>Collaborating with state, local, and tribal governments on regulatory and policy initiatives, technical assistance, and voluntary programs related to climate change mitigation and adaptation.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>Adaptation</p>
<p>Much of EPA’s work is sensitive to weather and climate.  Consequently, the various actions EPA takes to meet its obligations and achieve its goals, including promulgating regulations and implementing programs, take these variables into consideration.  For example, potential increases in ground-level ozone due to a changing climate could make attainment or maintenance of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) more challenging.  Similarly, attaining water quality standards will become more difficult as water temperatures increase in response to climate change.</p>
<p>EPA must adapt and plan for future changes in climate to continue fulfilling its statutory, regulatory, and programmatic requirements.  The Agency will implement its Climate Change Adaptation Plan, and consider where it is appropriate to integrate and mainstream considerations of a changing climate into the full range of its programs to ensure they are effective under future climatic conditions.  EPA will work with state, tribal, and local partners to enhance their capacity to adapt to a changing climate.  Each of the EPA national programs and ten regional offices will implement new climate adaptation implementation plans to carry out the work called for in the Agency’s Climate Change Adaptation Plan.  EPA will also continue to collaborate with the U.S. Global Change Research Program and the Council on Climate Change Preparedness and Resilience to support the development and implementation of climate change adaptation plans by all federal agencies.[3]</p>
<p>Adaptation initiatives undertaken by EPA national programs and regional offices will carry out key elements of the President’s <em>Climate Action Plan</em> (June 2013) and aim to increase the resilience of communities and ecosystems to climate change by increasing their ability to anticipate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from the impacts of a changing climate.  EPA is encouraging and supporting smarter, more resilient investments by integrating considerations of climate change impacts and adaptive measures into major grant, loan, contract, and technical assistance programs, consistent with existing authorities.  For example, EPA is integrating climate adaptation criteria into the Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Funds and grants for brownfields cleanup.  EPA is also partnering with states, tribes, and urban and rural communities to integrate climate change data, models, information, and other decision-support tools into their planning processes in ways that empower them to anticipate, prepare for, and adapt to a changing climate.  As an example, EPA developed a stormwater calculator that will enable users to evaluate the effectiveness of alternative strategies for limiting stormwater runoff that can overwhelm sewer systems and spill into rivers and streams, and to identify strategies that ensure the systems are effective under future climatic conditions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u>External Factors and Emerging Issues</u></p>
<p>External influences on EPA’s efforts to improve air quality and address climate change issues include the evolution of state and local transportation and energy-related policies and the impacts of a changing climate, such as changes in rainfall amount and intensity, shifting weather and seasonal patterns, and increases in flood plain elevations and sea levels.  Some of these external influences present significant challenges to the EPA’s work, whereas others, such as the growth of alternative energy sources and increased investments in energy efficiency, can improve local air quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

</p>
                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>Taking into account the most current health effects research findings[1], EPA has completed new, more health-protective national ambient air quality standards for particulate matter (December 2012), lead (October 2008), sulfur dioxide (June 2010), nitrogen dioxide (January 2010), and carbon monoxide (August 2011), and is currently reviewing the standard for ozone.  Over the next 4 years, we will work with states and tribes to develop and implement plans to achieve and maintain these standards.  Our efforts provide the tools and information necessary for EPA, states, and tribes to implement air quality standards and controls.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>EPA will work with states and tribes to decrease the emissions that contribute to interstate transport of air pollution.  These efforts will help many areas of the country attain the standards and achieve significant improvements in human health.  Working with states and tribes, EPA will continue implementing cost-effective multi-state regional programs designed to control the significant contributions of power plant and other stationary source emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) and nitrogen oxide (NO<sub>x</sub>) to air quality problems (i.e., nonattainment and interference with maintenance of ozone and PM<sub>2.5 </sub>NAAQS) in downwind areas.  Operating programs in 2014 will include the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) or a replacement program for control of transported ozone and PM<sub>2.5 </sub>pollution[2], in addition to the national acid rain SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>x </sub>emission reduction programs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As we implement national air quality standards, we will seek ways to increase efficiency and maximize results.  These efforts include:  working with states to improve the state implementation plan approval process, including the use of full-cycle analysis (i.e., identifying specific actions along a time line needed to facilitate the timely issuance of implementation rules and guidelines); modernizing our training program for state, local, and tribal agencies through an e-learning system; and implementation of electronic emission reporting as part of the Agency’s E-Enterprise initiative.</p>
<p>Additionally, EPA will work to ensure that our efforts to improve air quality consider low-income and minority communities that are disproportionately impacted by pollution.  The Agency will continue to implement the goals of the Environmental Justice (EJ) 2014 strategy that focus on protecting health in communities overburdened by pollution, empowering communities to take action to improve their health and environment, and establishing partnerships with local, state, tribal, and federal organizations to achieve healthy and sustainable communities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>EPA has finalized a number of air pollution control standards over the last decade that have substantially reduced, and will continue to reduce, PM, NO<sub>x</sub>, volatile organic chemicals (VOCs), air toxics, and GHG emissions.  These standards will cut emissions from new vehicles and engines by over 90 percent, with an estimated $290 billion in net health benefits by 2030.  In addition, EPA partnership programs such as the SmartWay Transport program, are achieving important reductions in emissions from the existing fleet of diesel engines that are not subject to the new standards.[3]</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Looking forward, EPA will collect and evaluate mobile source emission data to help guide future program priorities.  Other factors to consider include the health and environmental effects of emissions and future advancements in technology that could provide opportunities for further emission reductions.</p>
<p>The Agency also recognizes the importance of fuels work and the critical need to understand the challenges and opportunities this work presents.  EPA will continue to coordinate with the Department of Energy (DOE), Department of Agriculture (USDA), and other interagency partners on these issues as appropriate.  The Agency plans to focus on streamlining the implementation processes of the renewable fuel standard (RFS) program, including the annual standard-setting process and new fuel pathway approvals.  EPA will also strengthen its oversight of industry compliance with RFS standards and core fuels and fuels additive registration mandates through a voluntary third-party quality assurance program to verify that renewable identification numbers (RINs) have been validly generated.  In addition, proposed modifications to the exporter provisions of the RFS program will help to ensure that an appropriate number and type of RINs are retired whenever renewable fuel is exported.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Air toxics and other air pollutants can be widespread and/or community specific.  They are emitted by large industry, small businesses, motor vehicles, and many other common activities. Although certain chemicals are ubiquitous throughout the country, in some areas of concentrated industrial and/or mobile source activity, concentrations may be significantly greater.  To support effective air toxics reduction policies, EPA uses data from our national toxics monitoring network and from national and local assessments to provide key information to better characterize risks and assess priorities.  EPA also leverages pollution prevention and green expertise to reduce air toxics emissions and associated risk.</p>
<p>   EPA recognizes that air toxics pose unique challenges both nationally and at the community level, and we focus on relatively high-risk sources, pollutants, and exposure situations.  EPA will continue to set and enforce control technology-based air toxics emissions standards and, where needed, amend those standards to address residual risk and technology advancements.  These regulations are aimed at reducing toxic air pollution from stationary sources and targeted priority source categories, reducing pollution in communities, utilizing a more cost-effective “sector-based” approach, and providing tools to help communities and other stakeholders participate in rulemaking.  Priority categories include petroleum refining, iron and steel manufacturing, chemical manufacturing, and Portland cement.  EPA takes advantage of the natural overlap of certain air toxics and criteria pollutant rules and coordinates the development and implementation of Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards and New Source Performance Standards (NSPSs) where appropriate.  By coordinating MACT standard development for specific source categories with other rulemaking efforts, EPA can substantially reduce the resources needed to develop standards; provide more certainty and lower cost for industry; simplify implementation for state, local, and tribal agencies; and, enhance cost-effective regulatory approaches.  To address unacceptable risks that may remain after implementing national strategies, EPA works with states, tribes, and local agencies and organizations to understand the risks at the local level, target the problem areas, and tailor reduction strategies and approaches to the unique situations in those areas.</p>
<p>To improve indoor air quality, EPA deploys programs that educate the public about indoor air quality concerns, including radon, and promotes public action to reduce potential risks in homes, schools, and workplaces.  Included among the people most exposed to indoor air pollutants are  those most susceptible to the effects—the young, the elderly, and the chronically ill.  In addition, EPA collaborates with state and tribal organizations, environmental and public health officials, housing, energy, and building organizations, school personnel who manage school environments, and health care providers who treat children prone to or suffering disproportionately from asthma.  The focus of these efforts is to create, expand, and leverage systems already in place to support community efforts to address indoor air quality health risks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u>External Factors and Emerging Issues</u></p>
<p>External factors that will affect air quality program implementation include the outcome of the appeal of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) decision and continuing legal challenges to stationary source rules.[4]  Also, impacts from a changing climate may worsen existing indoor environmental problems and introduce new ones as temperatures change and the frequency and/or severity of adverse outdoor events increase.  These impacts include increased mold from water damage and more time spent indoors where air may be of poorer quality.</p>

<li>In 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit remanded CAIR to EPA, but allowed the rule to remain in effect pending replacement by a valid rule.  In August 2012, the same court vacated EPA’s replacement rule (CSAPR).  The Agency successfully petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to hear an appeal of the D.C.

There is also an increasing expectation from the public and regulated community for the use of on-line systems and the desire for data transparency and personalized access. Both federal and state agencies recognize that easier access to and use of environmental data will facilitate better environmental protection and decision-making while also increasing overall data transparency.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Consistent with the 2012 White House Digital Government Strategy and Executive Order 13563, EPA seeks to transform the way business is conducted. E-Enterprise for the Environment is a joint initiative of states and EPA to improve environmental outcomes and enhance service to the regulated community and the public by maximizing the use of advanced monitoring and information technologies, optimizing operations, and increasing transparency. E-Enterprise will enable new environmental management approaches by modernizing EPA programs and regulations while streamlining and improving existing business processes. E-Enterprise will use the transformational capabilities of information and advanced monitoring technologies to identify and implement programmatic and service improvements.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>These improvements will include “smart” tools and services that guide the regulated community in understanding and fulfilling their federal, state and, local regulatory reporting obligations, offer basic validations and error checking of entered information, and support electronic signature submissions. E-Enterprise projects that take advantage of tools and practices such as advanced monitoring technology and streamlined data collection will also expand the ability of the government, regulated entities, and the public to see and measure pollutant discharges, emissions and environmental conditions. A fundamental premise of E-Enterprise is that providing a more complete and integrated (cross media - air, water, and land) view of environmental data can support greener behavior of the public and regulated entities. For example, broad availability of high-speed internet allows real-time reporting of emissions and provides unprecedented opportunities for transparency and public involvement in matters affecting local environmental conditions. These technological advances will allow better tracking of environmental progress. Innovative technology can also help regulators improve compliance with environmental laws.</p>

</p>
                        <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>EPA’s strategies to address climate change reflect the President’s call to action in his <em>Climate Action Plan</em> (June 2013), which, among other initiatives, tasks EPA with setting carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) standards for power plants and applying the Agency’s authorities and other tools to address hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and methane.  These strategies support the President's goal to reduce GHG emissions by 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020.[1]  EPA and its partners are developing and implementing approaches to reduce GHG emissions domestically and internationally through cost-effective, voluntary programs while pursuing additional regulatory actions as needed.  Our efforts address the following areas:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mobile Sources</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Implementing three sets of GHG standards for vehicles and trucks, including:  two sets of GHG standards for light-duty cars and trucks (model years 2012-2016 and 2017-2025); and the first set of standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks and buses (model years 2014-2018).  These emission standards, finalized jointly with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) fuel economy standards, will result in substantial reductions in new vehicle GHG emissions from model years 2012 through 2025.  (Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks is an FY 2014-2015 Agency Priority Goal.[2])</li>
<li>Carrying out the next phase of the GHG vehicle emission standards.  Consistent with the President’s <em>Climate Action Plan</em>, the Agency plans to propose in March 2015 a second phase of fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emission standards for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles for model years 2018 and beyond, and plans to finalize the standards in March 2016.  This second phase of regulations will build upon the success of the first phase and offer further opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and decrease transportation fuel consumption, and is expected to benefit consumers and business by reducing the cost of transporting goods while spurring job growth and innovation in the clean energy technology sector.</li>
<li>Assessing GHG control options for non-road sources, including evaluating whether and when to commence work on standards setting for GHG emissions from a wide range of non-road equipment, locomotives, marine vessels and aircraft, and transportation fuels.</li>
</ul><p>Stationary Sources</p>
<ul><li>Using authority under Section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act, EPA  issued a new proposal on September 20, 2013 for GHG performance standards for new power plants and will subsequently finalize that rule after consideration of public comment as appropriate.  Using authority under Sections 111(b) and 111(d) of the Act, EPA will issue proposed GHG standards, regulations, or guidelines, as appropriate, for modified, reconstructed, and existing power plants by June 1, 2014, and finalize these standards, regulations, or guidelines by June 1, 2015.</li>
<li>Collecting and publishing high-quality GHG emissions data from large direct emitters and suppliers of GHGs through the greenhouse gas reporting program to inform the public and support sound, data-driven, policy decisions on climate change.</li>
<li>Implementing permitting requirements for facilities that emit large amounts of GHGs to encourage design and construction of more sustainable, efficient, and advanced processes that will contribute to a clean energy economy.</li>
<li>Applying the Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) program to promote the use of low global warming potential HFCs and similar chemicals.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>International and Other Efforts</p>
<ul><li>Implementing proven voluntary programs that maximize GHG reductions through the greater use of technologies, products, and practices that promote energy efficiency, and renewables programs and policies that benefit the environment and human health.</li>
<li>Identifying and assessing substitute chemical and ozone-depleting substances and processes for their global warming potential.</li>
<li>Collaborating with countries and other international partners to reduce methane emissions and deliver clean energy to markets around the world through the Global Methane Initiative.</li>
<li>Collaborating with international partners to reduce short-lived climate pollutants, including methane, black carbon, and hydrofluorocarbons, through the Climate and Clean Air Coalition.</li>
<li>Educating the public about a changing climate and actions people can take to reduce GHG emissions.</li>
<li>Collaborating with state, local, and tribal governments on regulatory and policy initiatives, technical assistance, and voluntary programs related to climate change mitigation and adaptation.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>Adaptation</p>
<p>Much of EPA’s work is sensitive to weather and climate.  Consequently, the various actions EPA takes to meet its obligations and achieve its goals, including promulgating regulations and implementing programs, take these variables into consideration.  For example, potential increases in ground-level ozone due to a changing climate could make attainment or maintenance of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) more challenging.  Similarly, attaining water quality standards will become more difficult as water temperatures increase in response to climate change.</p>
<p>EPA must adapt and plan for future changes in climate to continue fulfilling its statutory, regulatory, and programmatic requirements.  The Agency will implement its Climate Change Adaptation Plan, and consider where it is appropriate to integrate and mainstream considerations of a changing climate into the full range of its programs to ensure they are effective under future climatic conditions.  EPA will work with state, tribal, and local partners to enhance their capacity to adapt to a changing climate.  Each of the EPA national programs and ten regional offices will implement new climate adaptation implementation plans to carry out the work called for in the Agency’s Climate Change Adaptation Plan.  EPA will also continue to collaborate with the U.S. Global Change Research Program and the Council on Climate Change Preparedness and Resilience to support the development and implementation of climate change adaptation plans by all federal agencies.[3]</p>
<p>Adaptation initiatives undertaken by EPA national programs and regional offices will carry out key elements of the President’s <em>Climate Action Plan</em> (June 2013) and aim to increase the resilience of communities and ecosystems to climate change by increasing their ability to anticipate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from the impacts of a changing climate.  EPA is encouraging and supporting smarter, more resilient investments by integrating considerations of climate change impacts and adaptive measures into major grant, loan, contract, and technical assistance programs, consistent with existing authorities.  For example, EPA is integrating climate adaptation criteria into the Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Funds and grants for brownfields cleanup.  EPA is also partnering with states, tribes, and urban and rural communities to integrate climate change data, models, information, and other decision-support tools into their planning processes in ways that empower them to anticipate, prepare for, and adapt to a changing climate.  As an example, EPA developed a stormwater calculator that will enable users to evaluate the effectiveness of alternative strategies for limiting stormwater runoff that can overwhelm sewer systems and spill into rivers and streams, and to identify strategies that ensure the systems are effective under future climatic conditions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u>External Factors and Emerging Issues</u></p>
<p>External influences on EPA’s efforts to improve air quality and address climate change issues include the evolution of state and local transportation and energy-related policies and the impacts of a changing climate, such as changes in rainfall amount and intensity, shifting weather and seasonal patterns, and increases in flood plain elevations and sea levels.  Some of these external influences present significant challenges to the EPA’s work, whereas others, such as the growth of alternative energy sources and increased investments in energy efficiency, can improve local air quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:<span class="acc_content_label"><p>Combined with DOT’s fuel efficiency standards, EPA’s vehicle GHG standards enable historic progress to be made in reducing carbon pollution and addressing climate change which threatens the public health and welfare of the American people. These standards will cut GHG emissions by about 6 billion metric tons and reduce U.S. oil consumption by about 12 billion barrels while saving consumers more than $1.7 trillion at the gas pump over the lifetime of the light-duty vehicles for model year 2012-2025. For commercial trucks, the estimated combined standards will reduce CO2 emissions by about 270 million metric tons and save about 530 million barrels of oil over the life of model year 2014 to 2018.</p>
<p>For the passenger vehicle GHG and fuel economy standards, individual consumers will save an estimated $8,000 on fuel over the lifetime (i.e., approximately 200,000 average vehicle miles traveled (VMT)) of a model year (MY) 2025 vehicle. For the heavy-duty truck standards, the average operator of a semi-truck can pay for the technology upgrades in under a year, and have net savings of up to $73,000 over the lifetime of the truck</p>
<p>This FY 2016-2017 APG builds upon the successes of the related FY 2014-2015 and FY 2012-2013 Agency Priority Goals related to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transportation activities.

For the heavy-duty rule, EPA is in the early credit earning phase, and will start in 2014/2015 to implement the first standards and assess compliance for the 2014 model year. The next phase includes incorporating the GHG standards in the light-duty vehicle rule for model years 2017-2025 (finalized in August 2012) and transitioning from the voluntary early credit earning phase (i.e., credit banking/trading, off-cycle credits, air-conditioning improvement credits) of the heavy-duty rule to the implementation phase of the 2014 model year standards.</p>
