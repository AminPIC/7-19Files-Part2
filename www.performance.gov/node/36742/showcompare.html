            <!--<div class="teaser collapsed">
                                            </div>-->
            <div class="">
                <p><strong>Problem / Opportunity:</strong></p>
<p>Valuing and accurately reporting over $2.2 trillion in assets, reporting over $2.4 trillion liabilities, and preparing full financial statements for audit. Audit readiness priorities expand from budgetary data reported on the Statement of Budgetary Resources (SBR) to all financial transactions reported on the Balance Sheet, Statement of Net Cost, and statement of Change in Net Position.</p>
<p><strong>Relationship to Strategic Goal and Objective:</strong></p>
<p>Achieving audit readiness supports the DoD Strategic Goal to Reform and Reshape the Defense Institution, and the Strategic Objective to improve financial processes, controls, and information via audit readiness.</p>
<p><strong>Congressional Highlights:</strong></p>
<p>As addressed in the NDAA (starting with 2010), directed requirements related to:</p>
<ul><li>The development of a plan that includes interim objectives and a schedule of milestones for each military department and for the defense agencies, supporting audit readiness goals, to include improvements and business systems modernization efforts necessary for the DoD to consistently prepare timely, reliable, and complete financial management information.</li>
<li>Developing a plan that should include corrective actions for any identified weaknesses or deficiencies to include identifying near- and long-term measures for resolving any such weaknesses or deficiencies; assign responsibilities within the DoD to implement such measures; specify implementation steps for such measures; and provide timeframes for implementation of such measures.</li>
<li>The Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness Plan describing specific actions to be taken and the costs associated with ensuring that the financial statements of the DoD are validated as ready for audit not later than September 30, 2017. Upon the conclusion of FY 2018, the Secretary of Defense shall ensure that a full audit is performed on the financial statements of the DoD for such FY. The Secretary shall submit to Congress the results of that audit not later than March 31, 2019.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong>Laws, Regulations, and Policies:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 (FFMIA)</li>
<li>OMB Circular No. A-123, Management's Responsibility for Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Control</li>
<li>National Defense Authorization Act</li>
<li>Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990</li>
<li>Government Management Reform Act of 1994</li>
<li>DoD Financial Management Regulation</li>
<li>Financial Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) Handbook of Accounting Standards and other pronouncements</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong>Key Barriers and Challenges:</strong></p>
<p>The size, diverse functional scope of business operations and frequently non-standard, decentralized execution of support operations makes this an extremely challenging endeavor.</p>
<p><u><em>Valuation of Assets:</em></u>  Valuation of General Property, Plant, and Equipment and of Inventory and Related Property is critical. Many of the Department’s assets were acquired decades ago and before there was a requirement to produce financial statements. As a result, the acquisition (cost) documents required for supporting valuation and audit are often no longer available. The Department must use alternative valuation methods.</p>
<p><em><u>Fund Balance with Treasury</u></em>:  Due to the size of the Department’s budget and the enormous amount of funds expended and collected, the number of accounting transactions that must be reconciled between the Department’s accounts and Treasury is very large and complex, compounded by nonstandard data, weak system controls, and edits at the end of the process instead at the beginning.</p>
<p><em><u>Universe of Transactions:</u></em>  Providing complete universes of transactions is especially challenging for the Components because of the numerous accounting systems used to initiate and record transactions as well as hundreds of feeder systems where most transactions originate. Components must verify that open obligations for all active and expired appropriations (beginning balances) are supported before starting SBR and full financial statement audits.</p>
<p><u><em>IT Systems:</em></u> The Department has nearly 500 individual IT systems relevant to audit. Meeting the needs of the auditors requires too many manual workarounds and stretches limited resources even more thinly. These systems are costly to maintain and result in substantial IT control issues. To efficiently audit the Department, auditors must be able to rely on the IT environment. The more systems DoD uses, the more difficult the task becomes.</p>
<p><u><em>Environmental Liabilities:</em></u> The Department has not been able to provide assurance that clean-up costs for all of its ongoing, closed, and disposal operations are identified, consistently estimated, and appropriately reported. Additionally, the Department is not able to consistently report environmental liability disclosures and supporting documentation is not properly maintained and readily available for all environmental sites.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation Efforts:</strong></p>
<p>A strategy has been implemented that includes close engagement with standards setters and audit community such as the DoD Office of the IG, the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB), and independent public accounting firms to define cost efficient solutions for audit “show stoppers.” In addition, the Department has collaborated with Independent Public Accountants and the FASAB to issue policies governing Existence, Completeness, and Rights. Further, the Department has established working groups to address critical capabilities needed for audit and is in the process of developing detailed implementation plans. The Department will continue to assess risks against these critical capabilities and adjust corrective actions accordingly.</p>
<p class="rteindent1"><u>Critical Capabilities Include:</u></p>
<p class="rteindent2">• Critical systems internal controls that impact financial statements<br />
• Fund Balance with Treasury Reconciliation<br />
• Complete Universe of Accounting Transactions<br />
• Property Existence, Completeness, Rights and Valuation<br />

                <p>The implementation plan to address the critical path tasks, corrective actions, and corresponding initiatives include ongoing monitoring and reporting of achieving milestones including Reporting Entity Audit Readiness Assertion, Validation, and Audit/Examination Start for each critical path area. </p>
<p>As the Department reinforced the importance of internal controls over areas of significant risk, the OUSD(C) FIAR Directorate responded by updating the FIAR Guidance and issuing memos related to property valuation and information technology controls. Further, the OUSD(C) FIAR Directorate deployed a Notice of Finding and Recommendation tracking database to monitor corrective actions.</p>
<p>
<strong>Targeted Efficiencies:  </strong>This initiative supports statutory compliance intended to enhance public confidence and trust along with providing accurate and timely information for decision-making.  Experience has demonstrated that there is measurable value that accrues from strengthening business processes, systems and controls. </p>
<p><strong>Internal Partners:</strong>  Senior leaders and technical experts from OUSD(C), the MilDeps, Defense Agencies, DoD Office of the IG. To facilitate the successful implementation of the audit readiness plans and enterprise-wide initiatives, working groups and reporting platforms with the aforementioned stakeholders have been established to evaluate these capabilities and ensure Department-wide policies and processes are revised / implemented as necessary.</p>
<p><strong>External Partners:</strong> Senior leaders and technical experts from U.S. Department of Treasury, the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board, and independent public accounting firm consultants.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>FY16 Q4 Progress Update</u></strong></p>
<p>Components continue to strengthen controls; improve cooperation across multiple DoD entities; reduce the number of outdated, stove-piped systems; perform update to data coding and interfaces to ensure general ledger accounts are accurate and complete and transactions are tied to the correct accounts; resolve the systemic issues of reducing journal vouchers and manual corrections; implement methodologies for consistent and relative valuation of our property and other assets; and determine the universe of transactions to include ensuring detailed supporting transactions are properly reconciled to support accurately recording transactions in the general ledgers.</p>
<p>Unsupported journal vouchers have been a self-reported material weakness since 2007. Remediating this challenge requires significant changes in the Department’s processes and how systems record accounting transactions. Although process changes and systems fixes are being identified and tracked, addressing journal vouchers in the near-term is very labor intensive, placing further demands on limited resources.</p>
<p>The Department negotiated a one-time exception with the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB), allowing DoD to forgo the valuation of existing land and software. However, for some categories of property, the Department must continue to ensure all property assets are properly recorded in property systems, valued, and supported. To address this challenge, the Department must automate solutions to capture the full cost of acquiring and maintaining assets. Contracts must be structured in such a way that the full cost of property can be readily determined, and automated solutions must be implemented to ensure that the cost of property is recorded and reconciled in both the general ledger and the property sub-ledger. Sustainable solutions must also be in place before the Department is allowed to execute the one-time exception.</p>
<p>The Department conducted extensive training and collaboration efforts with the Components and Agencies for the implementation of G-invoicing. Dashboards were created and interim reports were distributed on progress to date. In addition, the percentage of systems and data exchanges assessed for compliance against the Standard Fiscal Information Structure (SFIS) has progressed well, and target systems continue to be assessed by DoD’s Joint Interoperability Certifier (JITC). Also, the FM community continued to reduce legacy financial management systems by retiring 11 systems in fiscal year 2016.</p>
<p><strong>Specific Performance Measure Progress:</strong></p>
<p class="rteindent1"><strong><em>Universe of Transactions, Reconciliations to GL Systems, Schedule of Budgetary Activity</em> </strong>- All large Defense agencies and several mid-sized and smaller agencies have completed this reconciliation in preparation for FY16 audits and examinations. However, several mid-sized and smaller agencies have not completed this metric measurement area and the overall progress between Q3 and Q4 was not substantial enough to meet the goal.</p>
<p class="rteindent1">The Components that have not completed this measurement area include: U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), Office of the Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), DoD Education Activity (DoDEA), and Washington Headquarters Services (WHS).</p>
<p class="rteindent1">In partnership with CIO, DCMO, and OUSD(C), the Department is taking a new approach to UoT. OUSD(C). The Department experienced a delay in acquisition and funding for the enterprise UoT solution. However, funding has been received and the solution will be implemented in FY18.</p>

            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            <div>
                <p><u><strong>Overview</strong></u></p>
<p>With less than two years to go before the FY2018 audit begins, this year the Department prioritized our audit readiness strategy on those critical areas that have the most impact on the Department's ability to achieve its overall audit readiness goals.  By doing so, the Department isolated these critical path areas, determined a critical path timeline for achieving milestones related to these areas, and now the Department is measuring progress against those milestones.  Examples of these areas include identifying and reconciling the universe of financial transactions, creating greater transparency and resolution of journal vouchers, and developing and implementing a valuation methodology for property asset (such as equipment and buildings).  In terms of "next steps," each Component within the Department has identified clear and measureable interim milestones, coupled with targeted completion dates of these milestones (by quarter) through the end of FY2017.</p>
<p>As these were new targets at the close of FY15, measurement information did not become available until FY16, thus creating the "baseline" for future measurements.  Additionally, as the Department set these as the "critical path areas," the Department expects accelerated attention to these areas, and for the associated issues to be resolved prior to the start of the FY2018 audit.</p>

<p><u><strong>FY16 Q4 Next Steps</strong></u></p>
<p>Over the next year, the Department must support a number of concurrent activities, including ongoing audits, fixing issues identified in earlier audits, and planning for future audits—all simultaneously. Management must ensure financial statements are ready and presented accurately and an audit infrastructure is in place to support the independent public accounting firm audit. The Department will continue develop processes and controls to reconcile transactions posted to the Department’s FBWT accounts with the Department of Treasury’s records. Plans include (1) tracking and reconciling collection/disbursement activity from the core financial systems and associated feeder systems to the Department’s general ledgers and to Treasury accounts and (2) developing an auditable FBWT reconciliation process, to include implementation of internal controls that ensure reconciling differences are resolved in a timely and accurate manner.</p>
<p>Additionally, Components are unable to collect, exchange, and reconcile buyer and seller intragovernmental transactions, resulting in adjustments that cannot be verified or substantiated. To improve this process reporting entities will perform gap analysis on key processes, build and enter GT&amp;C’s agreements in G-Invoicing system. Components’ entities will also fund, design, and build all accounting system interfaces in alignment with Treasury’s G-Invoicing release schedule.</p>
<p>Components will continue to improve real property processes, controls and supporting documentation by completing floor-to-book and book-to-floor baseline reconciliation of real property, thus supporting existence and completeness rights and obligations. Additionally, Components will document go-forward processes and control environment for all lifecycle processes to include, acquisition (and construction in progress (CIP)), inventory, reconciliation with financial statements, and disposal.</p>
<p>The OUSD(C) has requested JITC to test additional accounting systems to encompass material financial and accounting activity across the DoD. In addition, the OUSD(C) will establish a portfolio management governance process to ensure legacy systems are retired on schedule. 11 systems are planned for retirement in FY17.</p>

<p>Generally, DFAS and DoD Agencies continue to work together to:</p>
<ul><li>Properly identify the necessary purchase order funding and source document information required for transactions necessary to properly identify obligation and source data (these areas are aligned to the Office of the Deputy Chief Financial Officer (ODCFO) Procure to Pay and G-Invoicing initiatives)</li>
<li>Addressing enterprise resource planning/target system conversion issues regarding proper loading of appropriation information to ensure proper posting of disbursements (these areas area aligned to the Joint Test Interoperability Command and Standard Line Of Accounting (SLOA) validation service initiatives). </li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>Progress on specific supporting initiatives:</p>
<ul><li>SLOA validation service was completed for SCS in January 2016.</li>
<li>Direct Treasury Disbursing, which specifically addresses where currently non-standard processes and inaccurate data for in-transits that must flow through various systems, was piloted by Army and DLA.  The Office of the Joint Chief of Staff organization went live for Direct Treasury Disbursing</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><u>Next Steps</u>:</p>
<p>The components and agencies are to submit their implementation strategies for G-invoicing, build requirements for general terms and conditions, and identify FY17 and 18 estimated systems requirements.  Army, Navy and Air Force have submitted plans for implementation.</p>
<p>In an effort to address the current issues enterprise wide with respect to lack of complete/proper data, the ODCFO (as coordinated with the agencies) is in the process of establishing complete data schema for interfaces via G-invoicing.</p>

Implement CAPs to include training relevant accounting personnel (Q2 2017).</p>
<p><u>Mitigation Strategy</u>: Target for Q2 2016 was 39%; actual is 31% which results in an 8% variance.  Although actions for the reconciliations requirements implementation continued in Q2, the ODCFO FIAR team identified a progress change (i.e. decrease) for one component, which has been identified for Q2. </p>

Implement CAPs to include training relevant accounting personnel (Q2 2017).</p>
<p><u>Mitigation Strategy:</u> Target for Q2 2016 was 49%; actual is 35% which results in a 14% variance.  Although actions for the reconciliations requirements implementation continued in Q2, the ODCFO FIAR team identified a progress change (i.e. decrease) for one component, which has been identified for Q2. </p>

<p>Army is working to develop a template for inventory reconciliations at each plant/physical location and will continue discovery work for program owned assets and assets that are located on contractor operated sites. Army will also continue to implement corrective actions identified through monthly testing. Army is also planning to achieve a physical count of 95% of the inventory balance (by value) at industrial operations sites while working to develop a template for inventory reconciliations at each plant/physical location. Navy will continue to perform quantitative assessments on unrecorded assets to develop a complete population. Air Force will establish OM&amp;S (contractor managed/possessed) baseline by obtaining asset level data from contractors (Q1 FY17).</p>
