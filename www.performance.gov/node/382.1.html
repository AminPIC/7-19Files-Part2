            <h2>Goal Overview</h2>
            <!--<div class="teaser collapsed">
                                            </div>-->
            <div class="">
                <p>The Obama Administration’s coordinated strategy to develop all appropriate sources of renewable and conventional energy on U.S. public lands calls for development of onshore and offshore renewable energy under a ‘Smart from the Start’ approach that prioritizes and processes existing applications in a coordinated, focused manner with full environmental analysis and public review.</p>
<p>As manager of one-fifth of the nation’s landmass and 1.7 billion acres of the outer continental shelf, the U.S. Department of the Interior has the resources to help America produce more energy at home, thereby supporting a growing economy and job creation and reducing dependence on foreign oil and increasing sustainable practices with reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Secretary Sally Jewell has placed a priority on “Powering Our Future,” emphasizing the responsible development of conventional and renewable resources on our nation’s public lands and waters.</p>
<p>Onshore, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has identified 20.6 million acres of public land with wind energy potential in 11 western states, 30 million acres with solar energy potential in six southwestern states, and 111 million acres of public land in western states and Alaska with geothermal resource potential.  Offshore, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) manages the Outer Continental Shelf, 1.7 billion acres of federal-offshore lands with enormous wind-energy potential, and approved in 2011 the construction plan for Cape Wind Energy off the coast of Massachusetts.</p>
<p>In addition to the multiple renewable energy efforts on public lands, the Department of Interior is reducing energy consumption within its own buildings while also self-generating renewable energy at over 1,000 Interior sites nationwide, including locations such as visitor centers, wildlife refuges, recreation centers, and tribal facilities.  Developing such renewable energy resources responsibly could help support a growing economy and protect our national interests while reducing our dependence on foreign oil and climate-changing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p><strong>Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives</strong></p>
<p>As the means for advancing the Administration’s ‘all-of-the-above’ strategy to develop domestic energy resources, realizing one of the Secretary of the Interior’s key priorities in creating a new energy frontier and as reflected in Interior’s Strategic Plan’s mission area to “Powering Our Future and Responsible Use of the Nation’s Resources,” this goal continues to expand upon the efforts started with the initial FY 2010/2011 Priority Goal to, “Increase approved capacity authorized for renewable (solar, wind, and geothermal) energy resources on Department of the Interior managed lands, while ensuring full environmental review, by at least 9,000 megawatts through 2011.”  As part of securing America’s energy future, DOI is helping to move our nation toward a clean-energy economy. At Interior, this means changing the way we do business by opening our doors to responsible development of renewable energy on our public lands. This means using a ‘Smart from the Start’ approach that prioritizes and processes existing applications in a coordinated, focused manner with full environmental analysis and public review.  Efforts include facilitating environmentally appropriate renewable-energy projects involving solar, wind and waves, geothermal, and hydropower. These resources, developed in the right ways and the right places, will help curb our dependence on foreign oil, reduce our use of fossil fuels and promote new industries and jobs here in America.</p>
<p><strong>Key barriers and challenges </strong></p>
<p>Renewable energy projects, especially solar and wind, are complex.  The Department is committed to permitting renewable energy projects on public lands in an environmentally responsible manner.  As a result, proposed projects are sometimes rejected or reduced in size and scope to avoid or minimize impacts to tribal and cultural resources, threatened and endangered species and their habitat, or areas near or adjacent to lands designated by Congress, the President, or Secretary for the protection of sensitive viewsheds, resources, and values that could be adversely affected by development.  Additionally, renewable energy companies sometimes decide to scale down, modify timelines and develop their projects in phases, or otherwise modify or withdraw projects for reasons unrelated to the permitting process.</p>
<p>By tracking progress on a quarterly basis, Interior is aware of the emerging complex issues and challenges associated with the formulation of renewable energy projects that require time and resources to address—including for example, rerouting and modification of plans to avoid impacts to natural resources like sensitive avian and wildlife species and tribal concerns.  Further, while Interior agencies play a critical role in facilitating the siting and permitting of renewable energy projects on public lands, there are other factors that impact a potential project’s progress, including the project proponent’s ability to secure financing and to obtain power purchase agreements with electric utility companies.  Technology and transmission constraints, such as an applicant needing to upgrade a transmission line, can also impact the overall schedule.</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong></p>
<p>This goal includes a broad number of stakeholders within Interior and externally.  It is a continuation of a FY 2012-2013 goal that was developed by BLM in concert with the Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management.  Other Federal agencies including DOI, USDA, EPA, NOAA; Interior bureaus including FWS, NPS, USGS; as well as States, local entities, conservation groups, industry and others  are engaged to advance the Administration’s ‘all-of-the-above’ strategy to develop domestic energy resources and to achieve one of the Secretary of the Interior’s top priorities for “Powering Our Future.”</p>

                <p>The goal tracks the approval of capacity for generation and transmission of power from renewable energy resources (solar, wind, and geothermal).  It expands on a Priority Goal Interior originally established in FY 2010.  Building on lessons learned over the past four years, Interior aims to increase authorized capacity of renewable energy resources to 18,000 mega­watts, which includes the approximately 1,500 mw approved from the 1970’s to FY 2010, by the end of 2015 toward the President’s goal of 20,000 mw by 2020.</p>
<p>Interior developed a Priority Project List, which focuses on renewable energy project applications most likely to complete the environmental review process in a timely manner so the project approval is likely.  Interior is tracking all of these priority projects through bi-weekly multi-bureau meetings to ensure issues are resolved in a timely manner and projects are kept on schedule as much as possible.  To see a list of active/pending projects, go to: <a href="http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/energy/renewable_energy/2014-15_Renewable_Energy_Projects.html">http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/energy/renewable_energy/2014-15_Renewable_Energy_Projects.html</a></p>
<p>To see a list of approved projects, go to: <a href="http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/energy/renewable_energy/Renewable_Energy_Projects_Approved_to_Date.html">http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/energy/renewable_energy/Renewable_Energy_Projects_Approved_to_Date.html</a></p>
<p>Management of the goal includes assessment of progress against the milestones associated with authorizing approved capacity for renewable energy development, tracking expedited approval or authorization of projects while ensuring full environmental review.  Environmental review is facilitated by the following:</p>
<p>Release of draft environmental assessment documents: every renewable energy development project must include either an Environmental Analysis (EA) or Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). This measure tracks the release of draft EAs and EISs and thereby the number of renewable energy projects under consideration.</p>
<p>Issue of Decision and Authorization: every renewable energy development project must have a decision issued either in the form of a Decision Record (DR) and Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) or a Record of Decision (ROD). Additionally, for wind and solar projects, a Right of Way (ROW) authorization must be issued based on the DR or ROD.</p>

            <h2>Progress Update</h2>
            <div>
                <p>During Q4 FY 2015, the Department authorized 485 additional megawatts of transmission capacity for renewable energy.   A total 15,615 MW of onshore and offshore generation and transmission capacity has now been approved since the start of FY 2010.  The FY 2015 results for megawatts of approved capacity fell short of target by approximately 900 megawatts due to protests received through the National Environmental Protection ACt (NEPA) process and a developer revising a development plan which delayed final approval of these projects.  Consideration of these projects will continue in FY 2016.  This Priority Goal will continue in FY 2016-2017 in expanding the development of renewable energy resources.</p>
<p><strong>Significance of the Accomplishment (through the Priority Goal) especially in relation to past experience and benefit to the public</strong></p>
<p>Advancing clean energy options remains a key component of the Department’s climate change efforts.  The Department is providing clean energy permitting on public lands and supporting extension of a modern electric grid to meet the President’s challenge to double renewable energy generation by 2020.  Since 2009, the Department has approved wind, solar, and geothermal utility-scale projects and connected actions on public or tribal lands and offshore areas, enough to power approximately 5 million homes.  </p>

<p>Progress depended upon each proposal successfully satisfying the technical feasibility and environmental suitability requirements, including environmental impact assessments and public comment stages required under the National Environmental Policy Act.  Each individual proposal progresses at its own pace in meeting these requirements, concluding with a Record of Decision.   Progress is typically made on a quarterly basis, dependent upon the number of projects being processed, the size and composition of the projects, and the ability of the proposer to meet the requirements, therefore making it difficult to predict the timing for when a project will be approved.  Over the past six years, the approved renewable energy capacity has continued to progress as follows:</p>

                <h2>Contributing Programs & Other Factors</h2>
                <div>
                    <p><strong>Contributing Programs within the agency</strong></p>
<p>Along with BLM’s efforts, the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) is engaged in energy planning and review to assist other agencies and the energy industry in avoiding and otherwise mitigating the impacts of energy development on fish and wildlife Federal trust resources.  FWS has issued onshore wind energy guidelines to help developers avoid and minimize impacts to land-based wind projects on wildlife and their habitats.  The voluntary guidelines were developed through an intensive public process with help from the wind energy, industry states, and wildlife conservation groups.</p>
<p>The National Park Service (NPS) also plays a special role in renewable energy to ensure that any leasing, siting, and permitting of energy facilities on the public lands near parks and other special status areas is done in a way that safeguards their resources and values. When the permitting of energy development could impact adjacent park units and other special status areas, the NPS is active in park protection and the decision mak­ing process.</p>
<p>BOEM held two offshore wind lease sales in 2013 in lands offshore of Virginia, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island for future wind energy development and continues assessments for potential future permitting for the generation of power from renewable resources in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).  BOEM has worked closely with state, tribal and local stakeholders and industry to develop and implement a regulatory framework for offshore ocean wind, wave and current energy development and identified several Wind Energy Areas along the Mid-Atlantic OCS that have the highest potential wind resources and fewest competing use conflicts.  Focusing development in these pre-approved areas will expedite the development of the region’s ample wind resources.</p>
<p><strong>Contributing programs or partners outside the agency</strong></p>
<p>Interior works with a number of agencies coordinating renewable energy work, including other Federal, State and local land managers and resource management agencies with responsibilities in the outer continental shelf.  The United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Forest Service manages 193 million acres of National Forest System lands that are important sources of both conventional and renewable forms of en­ergy.  In 2011, Interior and USDA issued a joint report to Congress highlighting the potential for responsible renewable energy development on Federal lands and a framework for interdepartmental cooperation.    The Department of Energy (DOE) has been a long-standing partner with both DOI and USDA.  The cooperation with DOE falls into several areas including training, direct tech­nical assistance, policy support, transmission planning, siting of large scale projects, research and development of new technologies, and spon­soring research and development of wind turbine impacts on wildlife.</p>
<p>The Department of the Interior, the Department of the Army, and the Department of Energy have significantly advanced potential development of hydropower generation in the United States with implementation of an interagency Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on hydropower.  The interagency cooperation has enabled the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Department of the Interior, and the Department of Energy to coordinate their hydropower research and development efforts that led to advances in hydropower technology, streamlining of the licensing and permitting process, assessment of the potential for adding hydropower generation at existing facilities, and the development of a database for all existing U.S. hydropower infrastructure.</p>

<p>As manager of one-fifth of the nation’s landmass and 1.7 billion acres of the outer continental shelf, the U.S. Department of the Interior has the resources to help America produce more energy at home, thereby supporting a growing economy and job creation and reducing dependence on foreign oil and increasing sustainable practices with reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Secretary Sally Jewell has placed a priority on “Powering Our Future,” emphasizing the responsible development of conventional and renewable resources on our nation’s public lands and waters.</p>
<p>Onshore, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has identified 20.6 million acres of public land with wind energy potential in 11 western states, 30 million acres with solar energy potential in six southwestern states, and 111 million acres of public land in western states and Alaska with geothermal resource potential.  Offshore, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) manages the Outer Continental Shelf, 1.7 billion acres of federal-offshore lands with enormous wind-energy potential, and approved in 2011 the construction plan for Cape Wind Energy off the coast of Massachusetts.</p>
<p>In addition to the multiple renewable energy efforts on public lands, the Department of Interior is reducing energy consumption within its own buildings while also self-generating renewable energy at over 1,000 Interior sites nationwide, including locations such as visitor centers, wildlife refuges, recreation centers, and tribal facilities.  Developing such renewable energy resources responsibly could help support a growing economy and protect our national interests while reducing our dependence on foreign oil and climate-changing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p><strong>Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives</strong></p>
<p>As the means for advancing the Administration’s ‘all-of-the-above’ strategy to develop domestic energy resources, realizing one of the Secretary of the Interior’s key priorities in creating a new energy frontier and as reflected in Interior’s Strategic Plan’s mission area to “Powering Our Future and Responsible Use of the Nation’s Resources,” this goal continues to expand upon the efforts started with the initial FY 2010/2011 Priority Goal to, “Increase approved capacity authorized for renewable (solar, wind, and geothermal) energy resources on Department of the Interior managed lands, while ensuring full environmental review, by at least 9,000 megawatts through 2011.”  As part of securing America’s energy future, DOI is helping to move our nation toward a clean-energy economy. At Interior, this means changing the way we do business by opening our doors to responsible development of renewable energy on our public lands. This means using a ‘Smart from the Start’ approach that prioritizes and processes existing applications in a coordinated, focused manner with full environmental analysis and public review.  Efforts include facilitating environmentally appropriate renewable-energy projects involving solar, wind and waves, geothermal, and hydropower. These resources, developed in the right ways and the right places, will help curb our dependence on foreign oil, reduce our use of fossil fuels and promote new industries and jobs here in America.</p>
<p><strong>Key barriers and challenges </strong></p>
<p>Renewable energy projects, especially solar and wind, are complex.  The Department is committed to permitting renewable energy projects on public lands in an environmentally responsible manner.  As a result, proposed projects are sometimes rejected or reduced in size and scope to avoid or minimize impacts to tribal and cultural resources, threatened and endangered species and their habitat, or areas near or adjacent to lands designated by Congress, the President, or Secretary for the protection of sensitive viewsheds, resources, and values that could be adversely affected by development.  Additionally, renewable energy companies sometimes decide to scale down, modify timelines and develop their projects in phases, or otherwise modify or withdraw projects for reasons unrelated to the permitting process.</p>
<p>By tracking progress on a quarterly basis, Interior is aware of the emerging complex issues and challenges associated with the formulation of renewable energy projects that require time and resources to address—including for example, rerouting and modification of plans to avoid impacts to natural resources like sensitive avian and wildlife species and tribal concerns.  Further, while Interior agencies play a critical role in facilitating the siting and permitting of renewable energy projects on public lands, there are other factors that impact a potential project’s progress, including the project proponent’s ability to secure financing and to obtain power purchase agreements with electric utility companies.  Technology and transmission constraints, such as an applicant needing to upgrade a transmission line, can also impact the overall schedule.</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong></p>
<p>This goal includes a broad number of stakeholders within Interior and externally.  It is a continuation of a FY 2012-2013 goal that was developed by BLM in concert with the Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management.  Other Federal agencies including DOI, USDA, EPA, NOAA; Interior bureaus including FWS, NPS, USGS; as well as States, local entities, conservation groups, industry and others  are engaged to advance the Administration’s ‘all-of-the-above’ strategy to develop domestic energy resources and to achieve one of the Secretary of the Interior’s top priorities for “Powering Our Future.”</p>

                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Statement:</span><p><strong>Oil and gas resources management.  </strong>By September 30, 2015, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) will increase the completion of inspections of federal and Indian high risk oil and gas cases by 9 percent over FY 2011 levels, which is equivalent to covering as much as 95% of the potential high risk cases.</p>
</p>
                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p><strong>Problem or opportunity being addressed</strong></p>
<p>The inspection of high risk producing oil and gas cases is paramount to help ensure that hydrocarbon production on federally managed lands are properly accounted for and results in accurate royalty payments to the public and Indian owners of such minerals.Oil and gas production on federally supervised lands represent a significant part of the nation’s hydrocarbon production.Operating regulations at 43 CFR 3161.3 (a) require the BLM to inspect all leases which produce high volumes of oil or natural gas and those leases that have a history of non-compliance at least once a year.The high risk cases are determined by four risk factors: production rating; number of missing Oil and Gas Operations Reports (OGOR); non-compliance rating; and, last production inspection date rating.</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>This effort is a component of addressing the deficiencies identified in the GAO High Risk report, which identified the areas for needed improvement including:</div>
</div>
</div>
<ol><li>ensuring data on production verification and royalties are consistent and reliable,</li>
<li>meeting goals for oil and gas verification inspections, and</li>
<li>ensuring that informal employee training is supported by formalized training courses offered on a consistent basis.</li>
</ol><p><strong>Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives</strong></p>
<p>Achieving a high rate of inspecting high risk producing cases will advance the BLM’s mission by ensuring that oil and gas operations are conducted in compliance with lease terms, with the regulations in title 43 CFR 3161.3 (a), and all other applicable regulations.  The BLM is charged, in Section 101. (a) of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982, with procedures to ensure that each federal and Indian lease site which is producing or is expected to produce significant quantities of oil or gas in any year or which has a history of non-compliance be inspected at least once annually.</p>
<p><strong>Key barriers and challenges </strong></p>
<p>The Bureau is limited in its ability to meet the requirement of inspecting all high risk cases by the number of certified inspectors available to inspect these cases.  Competing priorities take time from these inspectors in completing high risk production inspections.  High priority drilling and abandonment inspections must be completed prior to high risk production inspections.  In addition the Bureau has historically had a high turnover of certified inspectors.</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong></p>
<p>The Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Department of the Interior Office of Inspector General (OIG) has pointed out the failure of the BLM to adequately ensure production of federal and Indian minerals.  The BLM answered the requests from both the GAO and OIG.  This Priority Goal was created to help address some of the identified concerns while providing a forum by which the Department can continue to track the progress toward addressing the other concerns identified by GAO.  The goal was developed in concert with the White House and released with the President’s FY 2013 Budget.</p>

<p>As manager of one-fifth of the nation’s landmass and 1.7 billion acres of the outer continental shelf, the U.S. Department of the Interior has the resources to help America produce more energy at home, thereby supporting a growing economy and job creation and reducing dependence on foreign oil and increasing sustainable practices with reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Secretary Sally Jewell has placed a priority on “Powering Our Future,” emphasizing the responsible development of conventional and renewable resources on our nation’s public lands and waters.</p>
<p>Onshore, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has identified 20.6 million acres of public land with wind energy potential in 11 western states, 30 million acres with solar energy potential in six southwestern states, and 111 million acres of public land in western states and Alaska with geothermal resource potential.  Offshore, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) manages the Outer Continental Shelf, 1.7 billion acres of federal-offshore lands with enormous wind-energy potential, and approved in 2011 the construction plan for Cape Wind Energy off the coast of Massachusetts.</p>
<p>In addition to the multiple renewable energy efforts on public lands, the Department of Interior is reducing energy consumption within its own buildings while also self-generating renewable energy at over 1,000 Interior sites nationwide, including locations such as visitor centers, wildlife refuges, recreation centers, and tribal facilities.  Developing such renewable energy resources responsibly could help support a growing economy and protect our national interests while reducing our dependence on foreign oil and climate-changing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p><strong>Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives</strong></p>
<p>As the means for advancing the Administration’s ‘all-of-the-above’ strategy to develop domestic energy resources, realizing one of the Secretary of the Interior’s key priorities in creating a new energy frontier and as reflected in Interior’s Strategic Plan’s mission area to “Powering Our Future and Responsible Use of the Nation’s Resources,” this goal continues to expand upon the efforts started with the initial FY 2010/2011 Priority Goal to, “Increase approved capacity authorized for renewable (solar, wind, and geothermal) energy resources on Department of the Interior managed lands, while ensuring full environmental review, by at least 9,000 megawatts through 2011.”  As part of securing America’s energy future, DOI is helping to move our nation toward a clean-energy economy. At Interior, this means changing the way we do business by opening our doors to responsible development of renewable energy on our public lands. This means using a ‘Smart from the Start’ approach that prioritizes and processes existing applications in a coordinated, focused manner with full environmental analysis and public review.  Efforts include facilitating environmentally appropriate renewable-energy projects involving solar, wind and waves, geothermal, and hydropower. These resources, developed in the right ways and the right places, will help curb our dependence on foreign oil, reduce our use of fossil fuels and promote new industries and jobs here in America.</p>
<p><strong>Key barriers and challenges </strong></p>
<p>Renewable energy projects, especially solar and wind, are complex.  The Department is committed to permitting renewable energy projects on public lands in an environmentally responsible manner.  As a result, proposed projects are sometimes rejected or reduced in size and scope to avoid or minimize impacts to tribal and cultural resources, threatened and endangered species and their habitat, or areas near or adjacent to lands designated by Congress, the President, or Secretary for the protection of sensitive viewsheds, resources, and values that could be adversely affected by development.  Additionally, renewable energy companies sometimes decide to scale down, modify timelines and develop their projects in phases, or otherwise modify or withdraw projects for reasons unrelated to the permitting process.</p>
<p>By tracking progress on a quarterly basis, Interior is aware of the emerging complex issues and challenges associated with the formulation of renewable energy projects that require time and resources to address—including for example, rerouting and modification of plans to avoid impacts to natural resources like sensitive avian and wildlife species and tribal concerns.  Further, while Interior agencies play a critical role in facilitating the siting and permitting of renewable energy projects on public lands, there are other factors that impact a potential project’s progress, including the project proponent’s ability to secure financing and to obtain power purchase agreements with electric utility companies.  Technology and transmission constraints, such as an applicant needing to upgrade a transmission line, can also impact the overall schedule.</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong></p>
<p>This goal includes a broad number of stakeholders within Interior and externally.  It is a continuation of a FY 2012-2013 goal that was developed by BLM in concert with the Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management.  Other Federal agencies including DOI, USDA, EPA, NOAA; Interior bureaus including FWS, NPS, USGS; as well as States, local entities, conservation groups, industry and others  are engaged to advance the Administration’s ‘all-of-the-above’ strategy to develop domestic energy resources and to achieve one of the Secretary of the Interior’s top priorities for “Powering Our Future.”</p>
