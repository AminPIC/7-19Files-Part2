            <div class="">
                <p>HUD has committed to creating energy efficient, green, and healthy housing as part of a broader effort to foster the development of inclusive, sustainable communities. The residential sector is responsible for fully 21 percent of the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions.<a href="41782.html#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a> With approximately 5.6 million housing units assisted through its rental assistance programs, HUD’s share of this total is significant. HUD spends an estimated $6.4 billion annually on utilities (both water and energy) in the form of allowances for tenant-paid utilities, direct operating grants for public housing, and housing assistance payments for privately-owned assisted housing. Utility costs account for around 22 percent of public housing operating budgets, and a similar share in the assisted housing sector.</p>
<p>Reducing these rising costs—generating savings for residents and owners, as well as for taxpayers—is a key HUD priority. Significant progress has been made over the past five years with energy retrofits, healthy housing interventions, or new energy projects completed in more than 510,000 housing units.</p>
<p>In FY 2016-17, HUD will continue or expand energy investments in the residential sector to support the goals of the President’s Climate Action Plan to cut energy waste in half by 2030 and accelerate clean energy leadership—both in HUD-assisted housing, as well as in market-rate housing. We will reduce barriers to financing energy efficiency as well as on-site renewable energy generation, help unlock innovative and traditional sources of capital, and strengthen codes and standards that promote energy efficiency and healthy housing.</p>
<p>The need to retrofit HUD-assisted housing is not limited to the efforts to increase energy efficiency and reduce costs. Housing is also an important determinant of health, and poor housing conditions are associated with a wide range of health conditions, including respiratory infections, asthma, lead poisoning, and injuries. HUD makes homes healthy and safe through several programs, led by the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes’ (OLHCHH) lead hazard control grant programs and Lead Safe Housing Rule (LSHR) compliance. OLHCHH also educates the general public about healthy homes through a public communications campaign to help people connect the dots between their health and their home.</p>
<p>The production of lead-safe housing units will continue to depend strongly on the level of funding for the lead hazard control grant programs and the rehabilitation programs that make required lead hazard reduction measures in assisted housing covered by the LSHR. With funding for OLHCHH grant activities projected to be approximately level through FY 2016, and the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and Home Investment Partnership Program (HOME) experiencing significant funding reductions in recent years, the number of pre-1978 housing units made lead-safe in 2016 is expected to decrease.</p>

            <div class="">
                <p><strong>Boost Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Strengthen HUD’s programs and policies in new and existing HUD-assisted housing to support the President’s goal of cutting energy waste in half by 2030.</strong> In order to achieve this goal, HUD will be pursuing a number of actions, including:
<ul><li>Updating energy codes and standards;</li>
<li>Implementing a green Physical Needs Assessment (PNA) in public housing within the parameters established by Congress, as well as a uniform Capital Needs Assessment (CNA) “e-tool” for privately-owned, HUD-assisted and/or FHA-insured multifamily housing when a CNA is required by the Office of Multifamily Housing;</li>
<li>Supporting the adoption of comprehensive utility benchmarking protocols across HUD’s portfolio;</li>
<li>Providing incentives for energy efficient and green building through HUD’s competitive grant programs, such as Choice Neighborhoods;</li>
<li>Continued implementation of voluntary leadership efforts, such as the multifamily Better Buildings Challenge;</li>
<li>Strengthening partnerships with the Department of Energy (DOE), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and other federal agencies; and</li>
<li>Making available HUD’s technical assistance (TA) resources to support energy upgrades and healthy housing.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul><li><strong>Implement national partnerships to at least triple the amount of on-site renewable energy across the federally assisted housing stock by 2020.</strong> This joint effort of HUD, DOE, USDA, and the Treasury Department will for the first time focus on solar and renewable energy in public and assisted housing, as well as Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) properties, by implementing a key goal of the President’s Climate Action Plan, to reach 300 megawatts—equivalent to the energy used by over 90,000 homes<a href="41782.html#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a>—of renewable energy in federally-assisted housing.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul><li><strong>Leverage private sector and other innovative sources of capital for energy efficiency and renewable energy investments.</strong> HUD, working with federal and state partners, will help expand the pool of private and public capital investment for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs across the residential spectrum. This includes expanding multifamily Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) guidance and FHA guidance for single family PACE. In FY 2016 FHA announced guidance for single family PACE, providing eligibility for homes with a PACE obligation that is structured as a special assessment. Congress has also authorized the first Pay for Success demonstration to support energy and water efficiency investments in up to 20,000 units of HUD-assisted multifamily housing. The demonstration will allow HUD to enter into contracts with outside entities, which would raise private capital for water and energy upgrades in aging HUD-assisted apartment buildings.</li>
<li><strong>Support and expand the Better Buildings Challenge for multifamily buildings.</strong> In June 2013, HUD partnered with DOE to expand the Better Buildings Challenge to multifamily housing. The Better Buildings Challenge is a voluntary initiative that asks building owners and managers to commit to lowering energy use across their portfolio by 20 percent over the next 10 years.  Multifamily partners include owners or managers of market rate as well as well as affordable housing.  As of July 2016, 110 partners representing more than 690,000 units with 600 million square feet have joined the Challenge.</li>
</ul><p>HUD’s Annual Report to Congress, <em>Moving to the Next Level: Progress Report and Energy Update</em> (August 2016), provides an in-depth description of HUD’s energy strategies, and detailed results.  See <a href="http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/documents/huddoc?id=Report_Congress8-9-16.pdf">http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/documents/huddoc?id=Report_Congress8-9-16.pdf</a></p>
<p><strong>Enhance Safe and Healthy Housing</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Embed healthy and safe housing principles and research in all HUD programs.</strong> HUD will work at the Department-wide level to ensure that the health and safety of housing is embedded in HUD programs by making available information on best practices and healthy homes research findings.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul><li><strong>Support lead and healthy homes interventions and research. </strong>HUD will provide grants to states and local communities to conduct lead hazard control activities in older housing units. HUD will encourage applicants for its Lead Hazard Control grant programs to apply for Healthy Homes Supplemental Funding, which can be used to address housing-related health and safety hazards that may cause or contribute to a wide range of illnesses and diseases, including asthma, injuries, and cancer. OLHCHH will also fund research for developing and assessing cost-effective methods for identifying and mitigating housing-related health and safety hazards.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul><li><strong>Expand housing management practices that protect the health of residents. </strong>Housing management practices that promote healthier environments for residents include practices that use integrated pest management systems for pest control, utilize low toxic cleaners for regular maintenance, and adopt in-building smoke free policies that create healthier breathing environments throughout multifamily buildings.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul><li><strong>Review HUD’s existing physical condition assessment methods for opportunities to improve HUD’s ability to identify health hazards. </strong>HUD’s existing physical condition assessment methods focus on traditional physical safety hazards, which may miss certain recognized conditions that can result in health hazards. Consistent with the <em>Surgeon General’s Call to Action to Promote Healthy Homes</em>,<a href="41782.html#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="" id="_ftnref2"><sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup></a> HUD’s <em>Leading Our Nation to Healthier Homes: The Healthy Homes Strategic Plan</em>,<a href="41782.html#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="" id="_ftnref3"><sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup></a> and the federal <em>Advancing Healthy Housing: A Strategy for Action</em>,<a href="41782.html#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="" id="_ftnref4"><sup><sup>[4]</sup></sup></a> HUD will conduct a review of existing physical condition assessment methods for potential improvements in identifying health hazards. This review will include HUD’s physical condition assessment protocols, such as the Uniform Physical Condition Standards for Voucher Programs (UPCS‑V).</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul><li><strong>Ensure that all HUD programs and grantees comply with Lead Safe Housing Rule (LSHR) requirements, </strong>and other lead safety and disclosure requirements by 1) providing training on LSHR requirements and other lead safety and disclosure requirements to public housing agencies, HUD-assisted housing owners, HUD grantees, and HUD employees, and by (2) ensuring that HUD programs provide information on LSHR requirements and other lead safety and disclosure requirements to grantees.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul><li><strong>Work with Administration partners to encourage an interagency focus on addressing lead hazard prevention</strong> for both paint and other sources, including tap water. </li>

<p>A total of 80,661 energy efficient and healthy units were reported for FY 2016, against the FY 2016 target of 79,537 units, and against the two-year FY 2016-17 APG target of 160,000 units. Of these, energy efficient completions reported through the fourth quarter (Q4) totaled 61,829 units, while healthy home completions totaled 18,832 units. The data available for Q4 of FY 2016 includes an estimated 13,208 annual Energy Performance Contract (EPC) units. This data is still being reviewed and will be revised if necessary for the <em>FY 2016 Annual Performance Report </em>in early 2017. HUD does not anticipate this total changing significantly.</p>
<p>Given the Department's robust FY 2016-17 APG target of 160,000, HUD has made significant progress. Moving forward, HUD's production volume will continue to be driven by FHA endorsements, the growing RAD production pipeline, and Energy Performance Contracts. Meanwhile, HUD has seen the production begin to wrap up for older projects (FY2010 NOFA funded 202/811 units; Hope VI) and has discontinued other programs (PowerSaver; Green Preservation Plus). Given this incremental decrease in direct "green production" activities, HUD will shift its focus in FY 2017 to strategies which 1) institutionalize energy and water reduction, such as utility benchmarking and improved building code requirements, and 2) increase the adoption and effectiveness of current programs, through more outreach and TA.</p>
<p><strong><em>FY 2016-17 Energy-Related Units Completions by Program Office, through September 30, 2016:</em></strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>The Office of Community Planning and Development (CPD): </strong>CPD reported 8,708 energy efficient units in FY 2016, exceeding its year-one target by 1,057 energy efficient units. Completed CPD units consist of new HOME and Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)-funded units meeting the Energy Star Certified New Homes standard, as well as energy efficient CDBG-DR units built for Hurricane Sandy Disaster Relief. HUD also counts HOME units in California built to the Title 24 energy efficiency standard. (We are not currently tracking Title 24 non-Energy Star CDBG units) Although the HOME program saw its funding increase by $50 million from FY 2015 to FY 2016, this amount was still $50 million below the President’s budget request. Since FY 2010, the HOME program has seen its funding cut by over 50 percent. In light of these challenges, HUD has begun developing TA to help participating jurisdictions to identify local energy efficiency partners, incentives, and programs to make building to the Energy Star standard more attractive. HUD expects CDBG-DR Sandy substantial rehabilitation projects to continue past 2020 given the pipeline of planned and recently underway projects.</li>
</ul><ul><li><strong>Housing:</strong> The Office of Housing completed 26,491 energy efficient units in FY 2016, over 4,500 short of its year-one target. The shortfall is primarily due to the Office of Multifamily Housing Programs’ RAD program, which continue to see a slower than expected adoption of Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) and the lingering impact of the previous production cap of 60,000 units. A RAD project is considered "green" if the conversion includes LIHTC funding and takes place in states with passing Qualified Allocation Plan (QAP), as graded by <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5548ed90e4b0b0a763d0e704/t/57f692a403596e4942b96612/1475777194555/2016_QAPReport_Template_MG-10-41.pdf">Global Green USA</a>. As a result of the 2015 appropriations act, HUD can now convert up to 185,000 units through RAD’s first component. Given the existing waitlist of projects and time needed to complete the conversion process, many of these “new” units won’t be counted towards the APG until 2017.</li>
</ul><p class="rteindent1">In addition to the RAD program, the following multifamily programs are included in this total: FHA Multifamily Endorsements with energy efficient features, the Mark-to-Market Program Green Initiative, Section 202 and Section 811 projects funded under the FY 2009 and FY 2010 NOFAs and completed in FY 2016. These 202/811 projects required energy efficiency and water conservation measures and were encouraged to use green building design and features. With over 10,700 units and growing, the strong pipeline of "green" FHA Multifamily Endorsements reflects the industry's positive response to the mortgage insurance premium (MIP) reduction first implemented in April 2016. HUD anticipates serving 40,000 families over the next three years through this incentive alone.</p>
<p class="rteindent1">FHA’s Office of Single Family Housing reported 6,583 energy efficient units in FY 2016. The overwhelming majority of these units (6,382) were from the Section 203(k) mortgage program, which finance rehabilitation and home improvements in conjunction with home purchases (or refinancing of existing mortgages). Reporting for the 203(k) program operates on a significant delay, therefore HUD anticipated the final FY 2016 total to increase by hundreds of units by the next time HUD reports on progress (early 2017) due to completions that have yet to be manually entered into the system. The remaining single family housing units came from the Energy Efficient Mortgage (EEM) program.</p>
<ul><li><strong>The Office of Public and Indian Housing (PIH</strong>): PIH reported 26,630 energy efficient units in FY 2016, well below the year-one target of 21,485. This total includes estimated Energy Performance Contracts (EPC) units, which report in December of each year. Reported PIH units also include energy upgrades of existing public housing funded through the Public Housing Capital Fund (PHCF), counted as “unit equivalents”, as well as primarily new “developed energy efficient units” through mixed financing streams, HOPE VI, and Choice Neighborhoods. The PHCF in particular saw a very successful year, highlighted by the New York City Housing Authority’s efforts to implement energy-saving measures across a number of large developments. </li>
</ul><p><strong><em>FY 2016-17 Healthy Homes Units, through September 30, 2016:</em></strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes (OLHCHH) and CPD:</strong> OLHCHH and CPD reported an estimated 18,832 units made lead safe in FY 2016. These include lead hazard interim control or abatement activities carried out by OLHCHH under lead hazard control grants as well as such activities carried out by CPD under the Lead Safe Housing Rule with HOME and CDBG funds. OLHCHH grantees work to mitigate environmental hazards for improved health outcomes in housing, prioritizing units where young children are present. In addition to reporting on a variety of lead hazard control and healthy housing grant programs, OLHCHH also reports data on its Lead Disclosure Rule enforcement actions. HUD expects to publish an update to the Lead Safe Housing Rule in Q2 FY 2017 that will lower the children’s blood lead level threshold at which owners of HUD-assisted housing promptly identify and control lead-based paint hazards. OLHCHH is preparing training and guidance efforts to support this rule change.</li>

<p>Depending upon the program, many grantees have 30+ days after the end of the quarter to provide HUD with their data. In addition to this 30-day window, program offices often require additional time to process and verify the data. Therefore, a complete record of completions by quarter is not generally available until at least 60-days after the close of the quarter.</p>
<p><strong>Number of properties participating in utility data benchmarking</strong> (supporting indicator)</p>
<p>There is no HUD-wide system for currently collecting and reporting utility data. HUD is working to improve this indicator for the <em>FY 2017 Annual Performance Plan</em> to align with HUD's internal benchmarking strategy. A PRA for this strategy is currently in the public commenting period. Once the PRA process is complete, HUD will have a better idea of its annual targets. </p>

<p><u><strong>9/30/2016: </strong><strong>Implement HUD portfolio-wide utility data collection and benchmarking policies.</strong></u></p>
<p>This activity is <em>making progress.</em>This strategy includes benchmarking targets through FY 2019 for the Office of Multifamily Housing and the Office of Public and Indian Housing. Public comment is currently underway for the PRA for this initiative.</p>
<p><u><strong>10/31/2016: Issue Pay for Success NOFA.</strong></u></p>
<p>This activity is<em> making progress.</em>Multifamily Energy and Water Conservation Pay For Success Pilot PRA completed Public Comment in August 2016. HUD is working to publish the NOFA in early 2017.</p>

<p><em>Achieved. </em>CDBG, HOME, and other grant programs that conduct renovation and rehabilitation of older homes that may contain lead hazards are required to use standard wording on lead safety requirements (e.g. HUD and EPA regulations) in their program NOFAs. HUD uses the departmental clearance process to ensure that program NOFAs include the appropriate language on lead and healthy homes regulations and practices.</p>

                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>One of America’s fundamental ideals is that hard work and determination will open the doors to opportunity. However, for too long and for too many people, access to opportunity is still not within reach. Americans all want the same basic things for their families: a safe, affordable place to call home, a quality education for our kids, and access to transportation, jobs, retail, and services. Despite genuine progress and a landscape of communities transformed in the more than 40 years since the Fair Housing Act was enacted, the ZIP code in which a child grows up, all too often, remains a strong predictor of that child’s success. To this end, HUD seeks to significantly increase the number of housing providers, lenders, members of the real estate community, and others that fully comply with the Fair Housing Act and other applicable fair housing and civil rights laws and do not discriminate on any basis prohibited by those laws and regulations. While housing discrimination still takes on blatant forms in some instances, it has become more subtle through the years, resulting in under¬reporting and complicating effective enforcement. </p>
<p>In addition to enforcement, HUD works proactively to make access to important neighborhood assets measurably fairer in neighborhoods where HUD invests, and to ensure that policies and practices are in place to provide equal access to persons with disabilities.</p>

</p>
                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>HUD has committed to creating energy efficient, green, and healthy housing as part of a broader effort to foster the development of inclusive, sustainable communities. The residential sector is responsible for fully 21 percent of the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions.  With approximately 5.5 million housing units assisted through its rental assistance programs, HUD’s share of this total is significant. HUD spends an estimated $6.4 billion annually on utilities (both water and energy) in the form of allowances for tenant-paid utilities, direct operating grants for public housing, and housing assistance payments for privately-owned assisted housing. Utility costs account for around 22 percent of public housing operating budgets, and a similar share in the assisted housing sector. </p>
<p>Reducing these rising costs—generating savings for residents and owners, as well as for taxpayers—is a key HUD priority. Significant progress has been made over the past five years with energy retrofits, healthy housing interventions, or new energy projects completed in more than 510,000 housing units. </p>
<p>In FY 2016-17, HUD will continue or expand energy investments in the residential sector to support the goals of President Obama’s Climate Action Plan to cut energy waste in half by 2030 and accelerate clean energy leadership—both in HUD-assisted housing, as well as in market-rate housing. We will reduce barriers to financing energy efficiency as well as on-site renewable energy generation, help unlock innovative and traditional sources of capital, and strengthen codes and standards that promote energy efficiency and healthy housing.</p>
<p>The need to retrofit HUD-assisted housing is not limited to the efforts to increase energy efficiency and reduce costs. Housing is also an important determinant of health, and poor housing conditions are associated with a wide range of health conditions, including respiratory infections, asthma, lead poisoning, and injuries. HUD makes homes healthy and safe through several programs, led by the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes’ (OLHCHH) lead hazard control grant programs and Lead Safe Housing Rule (LSHR) compliance. OLHCHH also educates the general public about healthy homes through a public communications campaign to help people connect the dots between their health and their home. </p>
<p>The production of lead-safe housing units will continue to depend strongly on the level of funding for the lead hazard control grant programs and the rehabilitation programs that make required lead hazard reduction measures in assisted housing covered by the LSHR. With funding for OLHCHH grant activities projected to be approximately level through FY 2016, and the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and Home Investment Partnership Program (HOME) experiencing significant funding reductions in recent years, the number of pre-1978 housing units made lead-safe in 2016 is expected to decrease.</p>

The residential sector is responsible for fully 21 percent of the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions.  With approximately 5.5 million housing units assisted through its rental assistance programs, HUD’s share of this total is significant. HUD spends an estimated $6.4 billion annually on utilities (both water and energy) in the form of allowances for tenant-paid utilities, direct operating grants for public housing, and housing assistance payments for privately-owned assisted housing. Utility costs account for around 22 percent of public housing operating budgets, and a similar share in the assisted housing sector. </p>
<p>Reducing these rising costs—generating savings for residents and owners, as well as for taxpayers—is a key HUD priority. Significant progress has been made over the past five years with energy retrofits, healthy housing interventions, or new energy projects completed in more than 510,000 housing units. </p>
<p>In FY 2016-17, HUD will continue or expand energy investments in the residential sector to support the goals of President Obama’s Climate Action Plan to cut energy waste in half by 2030 and accelerate clean energy leadership—both in HUD-assisted housing, as well as in market-rate housing. We will reduce barriers to financing energy efficiency as well as on-site renewable energy generation, help unlock innovative and traditional sources of capital, and strengthen codes and standards that promote energy efficiency and healthy housing.</p>
<p>The need to retrofit HUD-assisted housing is not limited to the efforts to increase energy efficiency and reduce costs. Housing is also an important determinant of health, and poor housing conditions are associated with a wide range of health conditions, including respiratory infections, asthma, lead poisoning, and injuries. HUD makes homes healthy and safe through several programs, led by the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes’ (OLHCHH) lead hazard control grant programs and Lead Safe Housing Rule (LSHR) compliance. OLHCHH also educates the general public about healthy homes through a public communications campaign to help people connect the dots between their health and their home. </p>
<p>The production of lead-safe housing units will continue to depend strongly on the level of funding for the lead hazard control grant programs and the rehabilitation programs that make required lead hazard reduction measures in assisted housing covered by the LSHR.
