                <p>The Violent Crime Priority Goal supports the Administration’s plan to protect our communities by reducing gun violence with smart prevention and investigative strategies in order to prevent violent acts from occurring.  Gun-related violence continues to constitute a serious threat to public safety throughout the United States.  While data shows that overall violent crime in the United States has decreased in the past thirty years, many communities continue to experience high levels of gun violence.  The Department recognizes that the challenges confronting each community are different and require solutions tailored to each community’s needs.  The Department will focus its actions and resources on 1) gun-violence prevention, by effecting an increase in the number of records submitted to NICS Index, which in turn supports the Department’s efforts to accurately and expeditiously identify persons who are legally prohibited from possessing firearms and (2) enhanced and more effective investigation by substantially increasing the number of records entered into NIBIN that contribute to investigative leads.  Collectively, accomplishment of these goals will demonstrate and facilitate our progress in preventing and investigating gun-related violent crime.</p>

            <div class="">
                <p>The Department’s efforts to protect our citizens from gun-related violence will be carried out in collaboration with our state, local and tribal partners.  Through the United States Attorneys’ Offices and the Department’s violent crime task forces, which bring together federal, state, local and tribal law enforcement, the Department will work with individual jurisdictions to address the impact of criminal organizations and gun-related crimes on communities.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol><li><strong> Strategies Relating to Prevention of Firearms Violence</strong></li>
</ol><p> </p>
<p>Central to Law Enforcement work preventing gun violence is taking steps to ensure that the individuals who are legally prohibited from possessing firearms, and who otherwise might commit acts of violence, cannot easily access guns.  The NICS is a critical tool in achieving this goal.  When a prohibited person is prevented from obtaining a firearm from a Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL), based upon a NICS background check, a crime – possession of a firearm by a prohibited person – is prevented, and a potentially violent act is averted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Federal law requires FFLs to conduct background checks to ensure that they are not transferring firearms to persons prohibited by state or federal law from possessing or receiving them.  Under federal law, persons prohibited from possessing or receiving firearms include, but are not limited to: persons under felony indictment, persons who have been adjudicated incompetent, and persons who have been convicted of a felony.  The NICS, which is managed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), is required to conduct its background check within three business days of the FFL contacting the system.  If the NICS transaction is not resolved within three business days, the Brady Act allows the FFL to legally transfer the firearm. Accordingly, it is critically important that the NICS has timely access to accurate and complete records, so that it can complete its check within the required three-day window.  The NICS has consistently completed over 95% of all background checks within three days, with approximately 92% of all checks being completed within minutes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For most checks, the NICS queries three databases:  the Interstate Identification Index (III), which is a general law enforcement database containing criminal history information; the National Crime Information Center (NCIC), also a general law enforcement database containing a number of relevant files, including those on persons subject to warrants and under restraining orders; and the NICS Index, a specialized database that contains records that do not require fingerprints. <br />

<p>The Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs administers two grant programs -- the National Criminal History Improvement Program (NCHIP) and the NICS Act Record Improvement Program (NARIP) -- which provide funds to states to encourage them to submit or otherwise make available relevant records to the three databases queried during a firearms-related background check, including the NICS Index.  At the federal level, federal agencies are required by the Brady Act, as amended by the NICS Improvement Amendments Act, to share relevant records with the NICS no less than quarterly. The President recently issued a memorandum to federal agencies to ensure compliance with this mandate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Violent Crime Priority Goal’s first performance metric is to increase by 10% the total number of records submitted by federal and state agencies to the NICS Index over a two-year period.  An increase for the period FY 2014 – FY 2015 is obtainable due to a variety of factors:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1) the administration of the Bureau of Justice Statistic’s (BJS) NCHIP and NARIP  provides grants to the states to improve the automation, completeness, quality, and accessibility of criminal history and related records for availability at the time of a national background check;  2) NCHIP and NARIP grant funding enables states to submit final disposition data to criminal history records, records of disqualifying protection orders, and prohibiting mental health information into the databases accessible to NICS; 3) training and technical assistance programs provided to the states and state court systems to enhance and improve criminal history systems and related records; 4) additional assistance Bureau of Justice Assistance provides to states that seek to improve the information accessible to NICS;<a href="http://prep3.uat.performance.reisys.com/node/464/edit?destination=agency-goals#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a>  5) the increased emphasis on federal reporting, underscored by the President’s Memorandum to federal agencies to ensure compliance with the statutory information-sharing mandate; and  6) weekly extraction of federal records from all U.S. Attorney’s Offices, on persons legally prohibited from possessing firearms, and the  monthly records submitted to the NICS Index by the states and federal agencies provided monthly to BJS by the FBI.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By working to achieve our stated goal, the Department will continue to ensure that the NICS Index remains a comprehensive source of data from federal and state agencies that prevents prohibited persons from illegally possessing guns.  Consequently, the Department’s goal of increasing the total number of records submitted to the NICS Index complements our efforts to ensure that prohibited individuals, who otherwise might commit acts of violence, cannot get access to guns is supported by NICS’ expeditious and accurate background check process.  In addition, as stated previously, because possession of a firearm by a prohibited person is itself a federal crime, the NICS background check that results in a denial effectively prevents a crime from occurring.  As an indicator for this performance goal, the Department will track and report the number of identified persons legally prohibited from possessing firearms due to the expeditious and accurate NICS background check and denial process.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol><li><strong> Strategies Relating to the Investigation of Firearms Violence</strong></li>
</ol><p> </p>
<p>The second and third Violent Crime Priority Goals’ performance metrics center on the Department’s use and promotion of NIBIN, which is managed by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), to enhance the investigation of firearms violence.  NIBIN automates ballistics evaluations and provides actionable investigative leads in a timely manner. When NIBIN is used to examine evidence from crime scenes, connections between pieces of evidence are established, perpetrators are identified, and criminals are apprehended.  Both the prevention of violent crime and the apprehension of violent offenders are vital components of the Department’s commitment to public safety.  NIBIN is rendered all the more robust and effective when more crime scene evidence is entered into it.  By increasing the number of NIBIN entries, the Department can also increase the number of NIBIN “hits”, that is, the linkage of two or more separate crime scene investigations, thus helping to identify more suspects and shooters and solve more violent crimes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To obtain an increase in the number of records entered into NIBIN, and the number of NIBIN “hits,” ATF will train state and local law enforcement personnel on NIBIN; train investigators and analysts on how NIBIN can assist in the violent gun related investigations; and work directly with sites where NIBIN is installed to ensure that they understand the entire NIBIN process and that they will be able to utilize the system to its full potential.</p>

            <h2>Progress Update</h2>
            <div>
                <p>The Department exceeded its 2-year targets for all three performance measures for the Violent Priority Goal.</p>
<p>The Department exceeded its 2-year target (a 10% increase for the “Number of records submitted to the NICS Index” over the FY 2013 baseline of 1,051,834 records), achieving an increase of 27.1%. The Department exceeded FY 2014 targets (1,104,426 records) for this measure by 43.1%.</p>
<p>For the second measure (a 3% increase for the “Number of entries in NIBIN” over the FY 2013 baseline of 171,115 records) achieving an increase of 21.3%. The Department exceeded its FY 2014 target (172,826 records) for this measure by 19.5%.</p>
<p>For the third performance measure (a 3% increase for “Number of “hits” in NIBIN over the FY 2013 baseline of 5,713 “hits”) the Department achieved an increase of 37.2%. The Department exceeded its FY 2014 target (5,769 “hits”) for this measure by 99.5%.</p>
<p>As a result of these efforts, a two year total of 187,879 identifed persons were legally prohibited from possessing firearms due to the expeditious and accurate NICS background check and denial process. In addition during this two year period, 6,190 federal, state, and local users were trained in NIBIN and 4,527 investigators and analysts were trained to identify how NIBIN can assist them in the investigation process.</p>
<p>FY 2015 4th Quarter Progress Update</p>
<p>In FY 2015 4th quarter, the Department exceeded its quarterly performance targets for two of the three performance measures for the Violent Crime Priority Goal and achieved 95% of its target for the third measure.</p>
<p>For the first performance measure “Number of records submitted to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) Index”, the Department submitted 276,157 records in FY 2015 4th quarter, achieving 95% of its quarterly target (289,254 records). This slight decrease in submitted records is largely attributed to records submitted by some federal agencies containing an expiration date, which requires their removal from the system and a slowdown in state participation and submission rates. However, over the last two fiscal years, the total NICS submissions has exceeded the projected goal. The submission of records by state agencies will fluctuate from one reporting period to another depending on whether new states begin submitting records into the NICS Index files, enter a backlog of records into the system, or simply supply the typical quarterly submissions. It is expected that state submissions will rise in the future as more states process their backlogs in this area.</p>
<p>For the second performance measure, “Number of entries in the National Integrated Ballistic Information (NIBIN) System, the Department submitted 55,654 entries in FY 2015 4th quarter, exceeding its quarterly target (44,062 entries) by 26% or 11,592 entries. ATF works regularly with their field divisions and local law enforcement agencies to stress the importance of entering ballistic evidence into the system and provide support in enforcement efforts where NIBIN is a key component in removing violent criminals off the streets.</p>
<p>For the third performance measure “Number of hits in NIBIN”, the Department submitted 2,175 hits in FY 2015 4th quarter exceeding its quarterly target (1,471 NIBIN hits) by 48% or 704 hits. Hits are defined as the linkage of two or more separate crime scene investigations, thus helping to identify more suspects and shooters and solve more violent crimes. The number of hits is a correlation with the number of NIBIN entries – as additional NIBIN entries are made, additional hits are normally generated for the similar reasons as the number of NIBIN submissions increase or decrease.</p>
<p>For the indicator, “Number of identified persons legally prohibited from possessing firearms due to the expeditious and accurate NICS background check and denial process”, 22,866 people were legally prohibited from possessing firearms in the FY 2015 4th quarter for an FY 2015 total of 100,719 individuals, exceeding the FY 2013 total of 92,111 and the FY 2014 total of 87,160.</p>
<p>For the indicators, “Number of Federal, State and local users trained in NIBIN” and “Number of investigators and analysts trained to identify how NIBIN can assist in the investigation process:, 764 persons were trained in NIBIN throughout the United States, while 631 persons were given presentations that focused on how NIBIN technology can assist in the investigation process.</p>
<p>Training –</p>
<p>A breakdown of training the NIBIN Branch provided includes Crime Gun Intelligence (CGI) training for 99 State, Federal and City law enforcement officers at the Arizona Narcotics Officers Association in Tempe, Arizona, and a gun intelligence class at the Department of Public Safety for 37 law enforcement officers from various law enforcement agencies. Additionally, 75 individuals from various Arizona Police agencies were educated in the benefits of NIBIN at the Arizona Chiefs of Police Conference and 64 New Mexico Property and Evidence technicians were provided CGI training.</p>
<p>Training was also conducted in Denver, Colorado for 15 participants at a NIBIN Roundtable Conference, and a NIBIN meeting was held at the ATF Detroit Field Division for approximately 10 individuals to include Michigan State Police, the Detroit Police Department, ATF, AUSA and the Wayne County Prosecutors Office.</p>
<p>The benefits of NIBIN were discussed with 30 individuals from the Flint area law enforcement working group. The NIBIN Branch also provided training to the ATF Detroit Field Division during working group discussions between state and federal agencies in Detroit for 30 individuals, and at a separate meeting between ATF and the Detroit Police Department regarding NIBIN for 30 law enforcement officers.</p>
<p>There were two separate NIBIN meetings held in Crown Point, Indiana at Lake County, Indiana High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) with approximately 20 individuals in attendance. The second meeting was attended by 25 individuals and included several high ranking police officials from various Lake County, Indiana Police Agencies. One meeting was held with a Chicago Police Department (CPD) Tactical Officer regarding NIBIN Leads related to the 46 Terror Street Gang. A meeting was also held with the CPD Detective Bureau Command Staff at the CPD Headquarters regarding the benefits of the NIBIN program. Approximately 20 people attended this meeting. NIBIN Training was also provided to 70 Task Force Officers and 20 Wilmington Police Department Detectives in Wilmington Delaware. Additionally, 95 special agent recruits were provided NIBIN training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Glynco, Georgia for Special Agent Basic Training.</p>
<p>NIBIN Training was also provided to 70 ATF Task Force Officers at Headquarters during the 4th Quarter of 2015</p>
<p>The Ammendale NIBIN Laboratory trained 6 individuals, the Atlanta Laboratory trained 8 individuals, and the Walnut Creek NIBIN Laboratory trained 8 individuals for acquisitions of ballistic evidence into NIBIN technology. NIBIN Training was also provide to 31 individuals though Forensic Technology and NIBIN Authorized trainers.</p>
<p>Presentations –</p>
<p>NIBIN presentations included a class presentation on CGI for 159 law enforcement officers at the Lawton, Oklahoma Police Department. A NIBIN presentation was provided to the San Diego Police Chief, the San Diego Sheriff, the San Diego District Attorney, and the Southern District U.S. Attorney. Three NIBIN presentations were also given to 60 Indianapolis Police Department homicide and aggravated assault detectives, 32 Palm Springs, California, Detectives, and 15 Portland, Oregon participants to include the Sheriff, District Attorney and Assistant United States Attorney.</p>
<p>NIBIN and eTrace presentations were given to the Palm Beach County, Florida, Sheriff’s Office during in-service training. The presentations were provided to 100 police officers and supervisors and took place in West Palm Beach, Florida. This presentation was also provided to the Palm Beach County, Florida, Sheriff’s Office to 60 deputies, sergeants, and lab personnel in West Palm Beach, Florida.</p>
<p>A presentation was given at a Camden County Police Intelligence Group meeting to approximately 25 detectives and street police officers. Topics discussed were crime gun intelligence and the importance of both tracing weapons and submitting weapons to labs for NIBIN, DNA and fingerprint identification. A NIBIN training/presentation was also given in Wilmington, Delaware to 30 Wilmington Police Department Homicide Detectives and State Police, and 150 ATF personnel were provided a NIBIN presentation at the Atlanta all hands conference.</p>
<p>A total of 631 persons were given NIBIN presentations throughout the United States in the 4th quarter of 2015.</p>

ICE has been working with FBI/NICS management staff to revamp its NICS submission format in preparation for future NICS enhancements. ICE performed a complete refresh of their data which has generated additional records submissions to NICS.  It is unlikely that ICE's 3rd quarter submission rate will be sustained for future quarters once the refresh process is completed. Nonetheless, the increased number of ICE submissions greatly contributed to attaining the measure's FY 2014 3rd quarter and FY 2014 annual targets.</p>

<p>During FY 2014, 4th quarter, NIBIN Branch personnel provided informational training on NIBIN and Crime Gun Intelligence, including eTrace training, to State and local police department executives, detectives, analysts, and police officers; and the Arizona Police Chiefs Association. A total of 1,103 individuals were trained throughout the United States.  While the 4th quarter's total of 1,103 individuals trained is lower than the 1,205 individuals trained in the 3rd quarter of 2014, this decrease can be attributed to several possible factors, i.e., end of budget year, and major conferences for laboratory and law enforcement personnel have already taken place. For FY 2014, a total of 2,726 individuals received training in this area.</p>

<p>In June 2014, the NIBIN Branch held the annual NIBIN Users Congress Meeting, the first in 2 years, to present ATF's Crime Gun Intelligence strategy to regional representatives of NIBIN sites. Sixty people attended and discussed the need for greater strategic usage of NIBIN equipment to provide timely leads to investigators that would result in targeted removal of active shooters off the street in their communities.</p>
<p>NIBIN staff continues to provide basic Crime Gun Intelligence training for Special Agenct Basic Training classes at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLEC) in Glynco, Georgia. An additional 48 new agent trainees were trained, and each new class will have this training incorporated into their curriculum.  This curriculum is in the process of being certified at FLETC, and if approved, will become an official part of their basic training course.  It is expected that the curriculum will be certified in either FY 2014 4th quarter or FY 2015 1st quarter.</p>
<p>Training and education about ballistic imaging and its use in Crime Gun Intelligence have become a centerpiece to ATF's NIBIN program not only with State and local law enforcement, but also in the ATF community.  ATF's NIBIN program has presented its strategies and successes to large groups of law enforcement, prosecutors, and laboratory personnel. This ongoing outreach is critical to communicating the message of their mission and strategy for targeting shooters.</p>
<p>When necessary, NIBIN equipment is repositioned to locations where it can be better utilized by law enforcement staff.  ATF St. Louis is in the process of repositioning equipment to Savanah, Georgia by the end of FY 2014 4th quarter.  Additional locations are being evaluated to include the three ATF laboratory sites.  An example of the use of NIBIN to link crime scene investigations and homicides in New Jersey and Seattle, Washington was cited in the recent artilce <a href="http://lnkd.in/dYjfVie">http://lnkd.in/dYjfVie</a> . This article refers to a "national ballistic database", which is NIBIN.  Since the beginning of FY 2014, 13 NIBIN sites have been upgraded with new equipment to replace outdated equipment. An additional 27 sites are scheduled to be updated through the FY 2014 4th quarter and continue into FY 2015. Having current equipment will maximize the use of NIBIN and generate submissions and hits.</p>

<p>Additionally, ATF is an active participant in the Violence Reduction Network (VRN) and hosted the kickoff meeting at the end of September 2014 at the Headquarters building in Washington, DC.  A total of 300 law enforcement personnel, prosecutors, and political figures participated in the meeting to begin the initiative in the first 5 cities identified -- Chicago, Detroit, Camden, Wilmington (DE), and Oakland/Richmond (CA). NIBIN is actively involved in these 5 cities and working with local law enforcement to improve and perfect the Crime Gun Intelligence process. ATF field division personnel are working with NIBIN Branch representatives to provide support to these cities to further the VRN mission.</p>
<p>Presentations on NIBIN and Crime Gun Intelligence were given to 295 Task Force Officers during their training at ATF this quarter. NIBIN continued to provide basic Crime Gun Intelligence training for Special Agent Basic Training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) in Glynco, Georgia, during the 4th quarter of FY 2014.  An additional 96 new agent trainees were provided the training, and each new class will also have the training incorporated into their curriculum.  The curriculum is in the final phase of the certification process under FLETC as an addition to their basic training course.</p>

This figure represents a decrease from 1,368 persons identified in the FY2015 1st quarter. This decrease can be attributed to several reasons, including: difficulties faced in scheduling travel to many locations due to inclement weather and the fact that many conferences and meetings will be held in the remaining two quarters of the fiscal year.</p>
<p>During this period, NIBIN presentations were given at various Crime Gun Intelligence Seminars and Meetings in California, Arizona, Louisiana and the Safe Neiborhoods Research Partner Orientation course in Phoeniz, Arizona.  At the Louisiana meeting, a visit to the New Orleans Police Laboratory was also included for attendees to discuss the Laboratory's timely processisng of ballistic material for entry into NIBIN and its effectiveness in providing leads in violent firearms crimes.</p>

</p>
                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>Violent crime remains a serious problem in many rural and urban areas and throughout much of Indian Country.  It continues to inflict a heavy toll on communities across America, limiting the quality of life for U.S. citizens, paralyzing neighborhoods, and stretching state and local law enforcement resources to their limits.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The vast majority of violent crime in this country falls within the jurisdiction of state and local agencies, and the vast majority of resources to combat it are provided by state and local governments.  While some cities are well-equipped to handle issues involving violent gangs, many smaller cities and towns are easily overwhelmed by the violence and criminal activity that gangs bring to their communities.  Each community faces different challenges that will require different solutions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Department will combat violent crime through vigorous investigation and prosecution of those who engage in violent criminal acts.  It will work with its law enforcement partners at the federal, state, local, tribal, and international level to combat all types of violence, from the neighborhood-based street gangs, to increasingly brutal and prevalent violence along the Southwest Border, to the transnational gangs operating throughout the United States and abroad, to violent criminals seeking haven in the United States.  It will also employ a comprehensive strategy that focuses on investigation, prosecution, and prevention efforts to address violence in America.</p>

</p>
                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>The Department must continue to be vigilant in supporting and protecting the most vulnerable segments of our population that may fall victim to crime.  Children are the most vulnerable and most exploited members of our society.  The criminal victimization of children impacts not only the children, but also their families, community, and society at large.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unfortunately, children are but one segment of society that is at risk.  In the United States and across the globe, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, human trafficking, and stalking occur in all ages, races, socioeconomic classes, genders, and sexual orientations.  Research shows that these crimes are overwhelmingly committed against women.  In addition, elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation is an area that has been overlooked but research suggests it is an ongoing problem in the United States.  Further, victims of crime committed on tribal lands is also an area that has been overlooked for far too long as research suggests violent crime rates may be two, four, and in some cases, 10 times the national average.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Department continues to stress efforts to reduce and respond to violence against vulnerable populations.  In April of 2013, the Department issued a revised Sexual Assault Forensic Examination Protocol to standardize up-to-date approaches to victim-centered forensic medical examinations.  DOJ will also work with the FBI to support states’ implementation of the revised Uniform Crime Report definition of “rape.”  As part of the Attorney General’s Defending Childhood Initiative, the Department will: launch a public awareness and community action campaign to stem youth violence; establish a Task Force on American Indian/Alaska Native Children Exposed to Violence; and partner with select states to form “State Commissions” that will implement model public policy initiatives at the state and local level to reduce the impact of children’s exposure to violence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All victims deserve to be treated with respect and support.  The Department will address the needs of victims by investigating and prosecuting matters impacting vulnerable groups while leading the way in providing innovative training, resources, and support to victims of crime.</p>

                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>The Department’s drug strategy will leverage the collective talent and expertise of several federal law enforcement agencies to identify and target drug supply organizations nationwide, to attack their financial infrastructure, and to disrupt and ultimately dismantle them.  Through the formation of prosecutor-led, multi-agency task forces that conduct intelligence-driven, multi-jurisdiction investigations, the Department will continue to mount a comprehensive, multilevel, organizational attack on the drug trafficking and money laundering organizations that pose the greatest threat to the Nation.  The Department will disrupt and dismantle major drug trafficking organizations responsible for the supply of illegal or diverted drugs in the United States.  Additionally, it will use the skills of prosecutors and agents from federal, state, local, and tribal agencies to combat the most prolific drug trafficking and money laundering organizations.  Partnerships with state, local, and tribal governments, along with grants and technical assistance will help reduce the use of illegal drugs and the violence associated with that use.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Southwest Border region is a particularly vulnerable area and has increasingly become a focal point in the national security strategy due to the considerable cross-border law enforcement challenges in the region.  The flow of narcotics north into the United States, along with the smuggling of criminal monetary proceeds and the illegal trafficking of firearms south out of the United States has had a devastating effect on the United States and Mexico, particularly along the Southwest Border.  Much of the violence along the Southwest Border region and in Mexico is perpetuated by drug trafficking organizations vying for control of trafficking routes to the United States and engaging in turf battles for disputed distribution territories.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The vast 5,225-mile border between the United States and Canada, and the evolving drug trafficking trends on both sides of that border, provide numerous challenges for law enforcement and intelligence entities operating along the Northern border under differing authorities, protocols, and expertise.  Marijuana and Ecstasy remain the most significant Northern border drug threats to the United States, while the United States remains the primary transit country for cocaine into Canada from South America.</p>

                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>The Nation’s recent economic crisis has had significant and devastating effects on mortgage markets, credit markets, and the banking system.  The Department will protect Americans from the financial fraud and corruption that devastates consumers, siphons taxpayer dollars, weakens our markets, and impedes our ongoing economic recovery.  The impact of financial crime is not confined to Wall Street – and many times the victims of fraud have worked hard and played by established investment rules, only to see their retirement and life savings vanish at the hands of white-collar criminals.  Additionally, the rapid expansion of Internet use throughout the Nation, including business and government, creates a continually growing risk of unlawful acts.  The Department will focus its white collar enforcement resources on these areas of potential fraud and associated corruption.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>These offenses represent separate and very severe threats to the United States’ economy.  The corruption of federal, state, and locally elected, appointed, or contracted officials, whether foreign or domestic, undermines democratic institutions and may threaten the condition of the economy, public safety, and national security, while wasting many taxpayer dollars.  As businesses, governments, educational institutions, and individual citizens continue to integrate the Internet and other global network computer systems, extortionists, hostile insiders, identity thieves, and other criminals have new opportunities and new venues to commit unlawful acts.  The increased presence of fraud such as corporate fraud, securities fraud, healthcare fraud, and mortgage fraud have escalated and will continue to hamper economic recovery and persist long after any recovery occurs.  IP crime poses a grave threat to the country’s economic well-being, as well as the health and safety of U.S. citizens.  Finally, transnational crime has expanded dramatically in size, scope, and influence, and transnational criminal networks pose a significant threat to national and international security.  In response, the Department will implement actions to support the Administration’s <em>Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime</em>, which seeks to build, balance, and integrate the tools of American power to combat transnational organized crime and related threats to national security and urge America’s foreign partners to do the same.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Department will pursue fraud and corruption committed against the Federal Government and state and local governments and their programs and will protect consumers through vigorous investigations and civil and criminal enforcement of federal laws.  These efforts will return significant amounts to the Treasury, Medicare, and other entitlement programs every year and provide deterrence to those contemplating defrauding federal programs, businesses, and individual citizens.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Crimes committed in the United States often have ties to networks or operations in other countries.  To address these threats, the Department is committed to expanding the scope and depth of international partnerships by enhancing collaboration; helping to establish rule of law through international treaties and training and assistance; and using international working groups to foster communication to enhance investigations, intelligence sharing, and threat awareness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Overall, the Department will continue to ensure that law enforcement at every level, domestic and international, is engaged in the fair, impartial, efficient, and transparent administration of justice.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Crimes of mass violence often lead to international instability, which puts the United States’ security and interests at risk.  Lack of accountability for past mass human rights violations increases the risk that such crimes will be repeated.  For more than 60 years, the U.S. Government has been a worldwide leader in efforts to end impunity for genocide, torture, war crimes, and other egregious human rights violations by holding perpetrators accountable in the United States through prosecutions or other available means.  The Department will continue its longstanding efforts to prevent the United States from becoming a safe haven for the perpetrators of mass human rights violations and to support foreign and international efforts to hold such perpetrators accountable.  The Department will also coordinate with other U.S. Government agencies to achieve an effective, whole-of-government approach to preventing genocide and mass atrocity.</p>

<p>In addition to these efforts, the Civil Division’s Office of Immigration Litigation (OIL) expertly defends government agencies in immigration-related litigation and issues that arise from EOIR decisions, such as when aliens file petitions for review in the circuit courts of appeals.  The caseload for OIL is directly tied to DHS’s adjudications and immigration enforcement, to the Department of State’s adjudication of passport applications, to the number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement referrals for denaturalization, to Department of Labor actions regarding immigrant labor, and to the immigration adjudication rates of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA).  OIL will continue to implement efficiencies and effectively manage its resources to meet this demanding workload.</p>

</p>
                        <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>Violent crime remains a serious problem in many rural and urban areas and throughout much of Indian Country.  It continues to inflict a heavy toll on communities across America, limiting the quality of life for U.S. citizens, paralyzing neighborhoods, and stretching state and local law enforcement resources to their limits.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The vast majority of violent crime in this country falls within the jurisdiction of state and local agencies, and the vast majority of resources to combat it are provided by state and local governments.  While some cities are well-equipped to handle issues involving violent gangs, many smaller cities and towns are easily overwhelmed by the violence and criminal activity that gangs bring to their communities.  Each community faces different challenges that will require different solutions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Department will combat violent crime through vigorous investigation and prosecution of those who engage in violent criminal acts.  It will work with its law enforcement partners at the federal, state, local, tribal, and international level to combat all types of violence, from the neighborhood-based street gangs, to increasingly brutal and prevalent violence along the Southwest Border, to the transnational gangs operating throughout the United States and abroad, to violent criminals seeking haven in the United States.  It will also employ a comprehensive strategy that focuses on investigation, prosecution, and prevention efforts to address violence in America.</p>
