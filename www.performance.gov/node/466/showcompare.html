<p>By September 30, 2015, working with federal, state, local, and tribal partners, protect potential victims from abuse and exploitation through three sets of key indicators:</p>
<ul><li>Open investigations concerning non-compliant sex offenders (4% over average of FYs 2012, 2013), sexual exploitation of children (3% over average of FYs 2011, 2012, 2013), and human trafficking (2% over FY 2013).</li>
<li>Open litigation matters concerning sexual exploitation of children and human trafficking (5% increase over baseline (TBD))</li>
<li>Percent of children recovered within 72 hours of issuance of an AMBER alert (90%)</li>

                <p>The abuse, neglect, exploitation, and trafficking of children, the elderly, and other vulnerable populations, causes irrevocable harm to victims and society.  Ensuring that our children, seniors, and all citizens can live without being disturbed by sexual trauma, physical abuse, or financial exploitation is more than a criminal justice issue; it is a societal and moral imperative.  Despite efforts to date, the threat of these crimes remains very real.  In the broadest terms, the goal of the Department of Justice (the Department or DOJ) is to prevent child sexual exploitation, elder abuse, and human trafficking from occurring in the first place, in order to protect every person from the physical and mental traumas associated with these crimes.</p>

                <p>The Department will address these issues by efficiently leveraging law enforcement and prosecutorial assets across the Department in a coordinated manner, including but not limited to: vigorously pursuing those who prey on our children; combating human trafficking crimes; enforcing federal law concerning unregistered sex offenders; increasing our understanding and capacity to address exploitation of the elderly; and working to provide comprehensive services to these particularly vulnerable victims.</p>
<p>The Department combats the exploitation of vulnerable populations by building partnerships, coordinating law enforcement efforts, training partners, and increasing public awareness.  In the fight to prevent and aggressively prosecute crimes against children, the Department will continue to use federal resources to target the most sophisticated and dangerous offenders and provide guidance and support to partners, including state and local task forces.  The Department will proactively identify and assist human trafficking victims; develop victim-centered, multi-disciplinary human trafficking investigations; and produce high-impact human trafficking prosecutions resulting in the conviction of traffickers, the dismantling of trafficking organizations, and the forfeiture of proceeds and instrumentalities of trafficking offenses.  The Department will continue to collaborate with federal partners to develop strategies to combat elder abuse, a critical issue given our country’s aging population.</p>

            <div>
                <p>The Department exceeded its 2-year FY 2014-2015 targets for five of its six performance measures, and achieved 89% of its target for the sixth performance measure.</p>
<p>The Department surpassed its 2-year targets for its three investigations performance goals. Achieve a 5% increase in open investigations concerning non-compliant sex offenders exceeded its 2 year target (1,841) by 26 for a total of 1,867; and exceeded its FY 2015 4th quarter target (424) by 27 for a total of 451. Open investigations concerning sexual exploitation of children exceeded its 2-year target (3,051) by 5,680 for a total of 8,731; and surpassed it FY 2015 4th quarter target (763) by 270%. Open investigations of human trafficking exceeded its 2-year target (218) by 47 for a total of 265; and achieved 98%, 53 open investigations, of its FY 2015 4th quarter target (55). The FBI’s numerous global investigations resulted in an increase of child sexual exploitation cases. The FBI engaged in extensive training and media efforts which, in addition to its strong network of law enforcement partners, also resulted in the surge of opened cases. The FBI also had several successful operations contribute to the increase in open cases. For example, FBI’s “Operation Pacifier” generated over 1,100 leads in the last half of 2015, many of which led to open investigations. The combination of all these efforts directly led to the dramatic rise in open investigations concerning sexual investigations. The FBI’s success stemmed from its efforts to provide training and education programs to raise awareness and expertise surrounding human trafficking.</p>
<p>For the two litigation performance measures, DOJ exceeded its 2-year target (5,424) for achieve a 5% increase in litigation matters concerning the sexual exploitation of children by 360 for a total of 5,784; realizing 1,575 open litigation matters in the 4th quarter of FY 2015. The Department achieved 89% or 152, of its 2-year target (171) for achieve a 5% increase in litigation matters concerning human trafficking; opening 23 litigation matters in Q4. The missed target reflects a temporary fluctuation due to a delay in transitioning new-matter intake duties to the newly hired investigator within the Department’s Civil Rights Division/Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit. Moving forward, the Department will continue its efforts to proactively identify and assist human trafficking victims producing high-impact prosecutions resulting in the conviction of traffickers and the dismantling of trafficking organizations. To further these efforts, the Department announced Phase II of the Anti-Trafficking Coordination Team (ACTeam) Pilot Program, in 2015. DOJ remains committed to the safety and well-being of children. Recent cases brought as part of Project Safe Childhood have resulted in convictions of child sex offenders; including the recent convictions of Yusef Yunosovich Abramov; a Los Angeles man convicted of sexually abusing minors while In Russia, and Patrick Killean, Jr. who was sentenced to 139 years in prison for producing, distributing and possessing child pornography and extortion.</p>
<p>For the sixth performance measure, percent of children recovered within 72 hours of issuance of an AMBER alert, DOJ exceeded its target of 90%, with an annual average of 94.6%. The AMBER Alert program has been extremely successful; the Department continuously exceeds its quarterly target.</p>
<p>Milestones</p>
<p>Elder Abuse: “DOJ will lead an interagency working group to increase the identification of crimes against the elderly in order to formulate a collaborative strategy to address these crimes by the end of FY 2015. In FY15/Q4, the Bureau of Statistics (BJS) will complete a pilot assessment of criminal victimization of the elderly and disabled adults living in institutionalized group quarters.” •</p>
<ul><li>Not Complete – The assessment is currently underway, however the completion has been delayed until FY 2017, due to survey work obstacles relating to gaining access to nursing homes for adults with disabilities.</li>
</ul><p>Improve the federal response to the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native children: “The American Indian and Alaska Native Children Exposed to Violence Task Force working group will focus on actions to improve the federal response to the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native children exposed to violence. In FY15/Q4, a cross-agency working group, including representatives from DOJ, will be reactivated under the GenI initiative. The working group will track the factsheets disseminated at the Tribal Youth event held in July.”</p>
<ul><li>Complete – A cross-agency working group, including DOJ, was reactivated under the White House-led GenI initiative. The working group updated the Tribal Youth factsheet for the annual White House Tribal Nations Conference, which was held on November 4-5, 2015.</li>
</ul><p>Human Trafficking victim services: “DOJ, with Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Homeland Security (DHS) will provide leadership to identify human trafficking victim services needed at the federal, regional, state, territorial, tribal, and local levels, as well as support interagency collaboration and communication aimed at enhancing federal agency victim services. In FY15/Q4, the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) will release a Georgetown University study of the effectiveness of interventions to stabilize, rehabilitate, and integrate foreign national victims of human trafficking in the wider society, and a Colorado College study that assesses the elements of state-level legislation that are most effective at improving successful prosecutions. Also in Q4, in conjunction with the rule revisions for the Victims of Crime Act Assistance and Compensation Programs, the Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) will revise grantee and sub-grantee data collection forms which will, for the first time, include human trafficking, where appropriate. OVC will coordinate with the Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) to align grantee guidance on new data collection instruments, as closely as possible.”</p>
<ul><li>Not Complete – The release of the Georgetown Study has been delayed until December 2015. </li>
<li>Complete – OVC worked with OVW and HHS/Family Violence and Prevention Services (FVPSA) to align Victims of Crime Act grantee reporting with the reporting required by these two agencies.</li>

The FBI has engaged in extensive training and media efforts which, in addition to its strong network of law enforcement partners, also resulted in the increase of opened cases. The FBI has also had several successful operations contribute to the increase in open cases. For example, FBI's "Operation Pacifier" generated over 1,100 leads in the last half of 2015, many of which led to open investigations. The combination of all these efforts directly led to the dramatic rise in open investigations.</p>

CRT - In FY 2015, CRT/HTPU transitioned new matter intake duties to a newly hired investigator who entered on duty during FY15/Q4, filling an investigator position that was vacant for much of FY15. Due to time-sensitive demands in already-pending investigations, cases, and enforcement initiatives, there was a delay in transitioning new-matter intake duties to the newly hired investigator, resulting in a temporary decline in new matters opened. However, the temporary decline has been entirely offset by subsequent increases once intake duties were transitioned.</p>

                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>Violent crime remains a serious problem in many rural and urban areas and throughout much of Indian Country.  It continues to inflict a heavy toll on communities across America, limiting the quality of life for U.S. citizens, paralyzing neighborhoods, and stretching state and local law enforcement resources to their limits.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The vast majority of violent crime in this country falls within the jurisdiction of state and local agencies, and the vast majority of resources to combat it are provided by state and local governments.  While some cities are well-equipped to handle issues involving violent gangs, many smaller cities and towns are easily overwhelmed by the violence and criminal activity that gangs bring to their communities.  Each community faces different challenges that will require different solutions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Department will combat violent crime through vigorous investigation and prosecution of those who engage in violent criminal acts.  It will work with its law enforcement partners at the federal, state, local, tribal, and international level to combat all types of violence, from the neighborhood-based street gangs, to increasingly brutal and prevalent violence along the Southwest Border, to the transnational gangs operating throughout the United States and abroad, to violent criminals seeking haven in the United States.  It will also employ a comprehensive strategy that focuses on investigation, prosecution, and prevention efforts to address violence in America.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Unfortunately, children are but one segment of society that is at risk.  In the United States and across the globe, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, human trafficking, and stalking occur in all ages, races, socioeconomic classes, genders, and sexual orientations.  Research shows that these crimes are overwhelmingly committed against women.  In addition, elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation is an area that has been overlooked but research suggests it is an ongoing problem in the United States.  Further, victims of crime committed on tribal lands is also an area that has been overlooked for far too long as research suggests violent crime rates may be two, four, and in some cases, 10 times the national average.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Department continues to stress efforts to reduce and respond to violence against vulnerable populations.  In April of 2013, the Department issued a revised Sexual Assault Forensic Examination Protocol to standardize up-to-date approaches to victim-centered forensic medical examinations.  DOJ will also work with the FBI to support states’ implementation of the revised Uniform Crime Report definition of “rape.”  As part of the Attorney General’s Defending Childhood Initiative, the Department will: launch a public awareness and community action campaign to stem youth violence; establish a Task Force on American Indian/Alaska Native Children Exposed to Violence; and partner with select states to form “State Commissions” that will implement model public policy initiatives at the state and local level to reduce the impact of children’s exposure to violence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All victims deserve to be treated with respect and support.  The Department will address the needs of victims by investigating and prosecuting matters impacting vulnerable groups while leading the way in providing innovative training, resources, and support to victims of crime.</p>

                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>The Department’s drug strategy will leverage the collective talent and expertise of several federal law enforcement agencies to identify and target drug supply organizations nationwide, to attack their financial infrastructure, and to disrupt and ultimately dismantle them.  Through the formation of prosecutor-led, multi-agency task forces that conduct intelligence-driven, multi-jurisdiction investigations, the Department will continue to mount a comprehensive, multilevel, organizational attack on the drug trafficking and money laundering organizations that pose the greatest threat to the Nation.  The Department will disrupt and dismantle major drug trafficking organizations responsible for the supply of illegal or diverted drugs in the United States.  Additionally, it will use the skills of prosecutors and agents from federal, state, local, and tribal agencies to combat the most prolific drug trafficking and money laundering organizations.  Partnerships with state, local, and tribal governments, along with grants and technical assistance will help reduce the use of illegal drugs and the violence associated with that use.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Southwest Border region is a particularly vulnerable area and has increasingly become a focal point in the national security strategy due to the considerable cross-border law enforcement challenges in the region.  The flow of narcotics north into the United States, along with the smuggling of criminal monetary proceeds and the illegal trafficking of firearms south out of the United States has had a devastating effect on the United States and Mexico, particularly along the Southwest Border.  Much of the violence along the Southwest Border region and in Mexico is perpetuated by drug trafficking organizations vying for control of trafficking routes to the United States and engaging in turf battles for disputed distribution territories.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The vast 5,225-mile border between the United States and Canada, and the evolving drug trafficking trends on both sides of that border, provide numerous challenges for law enforcement and intelligence entities operating along the Northern border under differing authorities, protocols, and expertise.  Marijuana and Ecstasy remain the most significant Northern border drug threats to the United States, while the United States remains the primary transit country for cocaine into Canada from South America.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>These offenses represent separate and very severe threats to the United States’ economy.  The corruption of federal, state, and locally elected, appointed, or contracted officials, whether foreign or domestic, undermines democratic institutions and may threaten the condition of the economy, public safety, and national security, while wasting many taxpayer dollars.  As businesses, governments, educational institutions, and individual citizens continue to integrate the Internet and other global network computer systems, extortionists, hostile insiders, identity thieves, and other criminals have new opportunities and new venues to commit unlawful acts.  The increased presence of fraud such as corporate fraud, securities fraud, healthcare fraud, and mortgage fraud have escalated and will continue to hamper economic recovery and persist long after any recovery occurs.  IP crime poses a grave threat to the country’s economic well-being, as well as the health and safety of U.S. citizens.  Finally, transnational crime has expanded dramatically in size, scope, and influence, and transnational criminal networks pose a significant threat to national and international security.  In response, the Department will implement actions to support the Administration’s <em>Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime</em>, which seeks to build, balance, and integrate the tools of American power to combat transnational organized crime and related threats to national security and urge America’s foreign partners to do the same.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Department will pursue fraud and corruption committed against the Federal Government and state and local governments and their programs and will protect consumers through vigorous investigations and civil and criminal enforcement of federal laws.  These efforts will return significant amounts to the Treasury, Medicare, and other entitlement programs every year and provide deterrence to those contemplating defrauding federal programs, businesses, and individual citizens.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Unfortunately, children are but one segment of society that is at risk.  In the United States and across the globe, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, human trafficking, and stalking occur in all ages, races, socioeconomic classes, genders, and sexual orientations.  Research shows that these crimes are overwhelmingly committed against women.  In addition, elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation is an area that has been overlooked but research suggests it is an ongoing problem in the United States.  Further, victims of crime committed on tribal lands is also an area that has been overlooked for far too long as research suggests violent crime rates may be two, four, and in some cases, 10 times the national average.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Department continues to stress efforts to reduce and respond to violence against vulnerable populations.  In April of 2013, the Department issued a revised Sexual Assault Forensic Examination Protocol to standardize up-to-date approaches to victim-centered forensic medical examinations.  DOJ will also work with the FBI to support states’ implementation of the revised Uniform Crime Report definition of “rape.”  As part of the Attorney General’s Defending Childhood Initiative, the Department will: launch a public awareness and community action campaign to stem youth violence; establish a Task Force on American Indian/Alaska Native Children Exposed to Violence; and partner with select states to form “State Commissions” that will implement model public policy initiatives at the state and local level to reduce the impact of children’s exposure to violence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All victims deserve to be treated with respect and support.  The Department will address the needs of victims by investigating and prosecuting matters impacting vulnerable groups while leading the way in providing innovative training, resources, and support to victims of crime.</p>
