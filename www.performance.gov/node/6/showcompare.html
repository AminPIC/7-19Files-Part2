<div class="intro_text">
<p>Established by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goals are a tool used to accelerate progress on a limited number of priority areas where implementation requires active collaboration between multiple agencies, overcoming organizational barriers to achieve better performance than one agency can achieve on its own.</p>
<p>Set or revised at least every four years, CAP Goals include outcome-oriented goals that cover a limited number of crosscutting policy areas as well as management goals focused on management improvements across the Federal Government in areas of financial management, strategic human capital management, information technology management, procurement and acquisition management, and real property management.</p>
<p>A series of 16 CAP Goals were announced in the 2015 Budget with clearly named accountable officials, data-driven reviews that incorporated a broad range of quantitative and qualitative inputs, and reporting to the public through a common website as a framework to drive performance improvements on cross-government collaboration and tackle government-wide management challenges affecting most agencies.</p>

<p>On June 30, 2016, the President signed into law the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 – nearly 50 years after President Johnson signed the original FOIA into law.  This critical legislation reflects the progress made by the Administration, codifies a number of openness and transparency principles, and ensures that the Administration’s track record of openness is institutionalized throughout government and carries forward for years to come.  Concurrent with the signing of the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, the White House released a Fact Sheet committing the Administration to:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Utilizing the Chief FOIA Officers Council and FOIA Advisory Committee to address FOIA’s greatest challenges;</p>

</div>  </div>  
  <div class="views-field views-field-field-cag-overview-revision-id">    <span class="views-label views-label-field-cag-overview-revision-id">Overview: </span>    <div class="field-content"><p>On March 19, 2015, the President issued Executive Order 13693, <em>Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade</em>, which set forth ambitious climate, energy, and environmental sustainability goals for Federal agencies over the next decade.  Executive departments and agencies have been among our Nation’s leaders as the United States works to build a clean energy economy that will sustain our prosperity and the health of our people and our environment for generations to come. Federal leadership in energy, environmental water, transportation fleets, buildings, and acquisition management will continue to drive national greenhouse gas reductions and support preparations for the impacts of climate change. The Federal Government has the opportunity to significantly reduce direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2025, while at the same time fostering innovation, reducing spending, and strengthening the communities in which our Federal facilities operate. </p>
<p>Employing this strategy for the next decade calls for expanded and updated Federal environmental performance goals with a clear overarching objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions across Federal operations and the Federal supply chain.  Goals for greenhouse gas emissions reduction (40% by 2025), renewable electricity (30% by 2025), clean energy (25% by 2025), and performance contracting ($4 billion in awarded contracts by Dec. 2016) are already well established in the Federal community. The enhanced target for each of these goals will require agencies to sharpen their focus on achieving the goals through existing mechanisms and new technologies that enhance efficiency and use of clean energy.</p>
<p>CEQ and OMB have worked closely to ensure that Federal agencies understand the necessary steps to pursuing the new environmental sustainability goals and those efforts are supported by an interagency Steering Committee.  Pursuit of these sustainability goals will involve at least 25 of the largest Federal agencies. Success will be greatly enhanced by the cross-cutting nature of the goals and the similarity in the tools and procedures used for implementation.</p>
<p>While all Federal agencies have an important role to play in ensuring the Government meets its energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets, key delivery agencies include: The General Services Administration, Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Energy, National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Department of Homeland Security.</p>

In the wake of increasing threats and incidents, the President directed a series of reviews to examine current security, suitability/fitness, and credentialing processes and to recommend areas in need of reform. The interagency reviews identified problem areas and made specific recommendations, which were approved by the Performance Accountability Council (PAC). The PAC developed the Strategic Intent to build upon these efforts and create a lasting impact by providing overarching strategic direction to personnel security, suitability/fitness, and credentialing reform efforts for the next five years.  </p>
<p>The Strategic Intent represents our framework for sustaining progress mandated by the February 2014 Suitability and Security Processes Review Report to the President, the January 2016 PAC Review of Background Investigations, relevant legislation, and other key drivers. It builds on progress since the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 and the subsequent, significant reform efforts that resulted in greater standardization and alignment of suitability and security processes. Through this framework, the PAC will work with other members of the Executive Branch to drive continuous process improvement to personnel security, suitability/fitness, and credentialing programs and address evolving threats. While we cannot eliminate risk altogether, it is imperative that we work across disciplines to maximize our collective efforts to mitigate the risks we face, while ensuring appropriate protections for privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. We must ensure measures to improve these programs avoid imposing unreasonable burdens on the Federal workforce that could negatively impact operations. Therefore, the Federal Government will pursue a balanced approach by addressing the risks posed by personnel who could do significant harm by virtue of the nature of their position.</p>
<p>These reforms will further support ongoing Insider Threat Program implementation by providing earlier detection and improving the quality of vetting. The improved attention to cybersecurity will reinforce efforts to protect sensitive mission data, including personally-identifiable information. </p>

According to AT Kearney’s Foreign Direct Investment Confidence Index, confidence in the U.S. as a location for FDI is high, ranking as the top destination for investment ahead of China, Brazil, Canada, and India.<sup>1 </sup>The U.S. remains the world’s largest economy and is also the largest recipient of foreign direct investment in the world. Over the last ten years, U.S. affiliates of foreign companies have employed more than five million workers, the majority of which are high-paying manufacturing jobs. On average, jobs created by FDI in United States pay up to 30% more.<sup>2</sup>  However, due to global capital mobility and increased foreign competition, we need to take steps to maintain and grow our share of global investment.</p>
<p>Historically, we have left our states and cities to compete for investments with a country’s investment promotion agency, limiting our opportunities to clearly demonstrate our commitment to attracting investment and to leverage our advantages as a top destination for investment. In 2011, through Executive Order, the U.S. launched SelectUSA, the first Federal effort to promote and facilitate inbound business investment. The E.O. created the Interagency Investment Working Group (IIWG) to further design and implement the first-ever coordinated U.S. investment promotion authority. As a driver for success, the global investment team, consisting of both SelectUSA headquarters in DC and investment teams at posts led by Ambassadors, will increase the number of active investment cases touched to encourage business investments.</p>
<p>At the first SelectUSA Investment Summit in Oct 31-Nov. 1 2013, the President reformed SelectUSA, creating a number of firsts: for the first time there will be a clear system for advocacy for high-priority, job-creating investments, driven by the most senior Administration officials all the way up to the President; for the first time there will be a single point of contact for ready investors looking to bring jobs and production to the U.S.; lastly, the Administration is engaging in unprecedented coordinated support for states and localities to attract investment.</p>
<p>Key contributing agencies to the Job-Creating Investment CAP goal include the Department of Commerce, Small Business Administration, US Department of Agriculture, Department of State, Department of Homeland Security, and Export-Import Bank of the U.S.</p>

Over time, the process and legal requirements for the permitting and review of major infrastructure projects have developed in a siloed and ad-hoc way, creating complex processes that in some cases have taken years or longer to complete.  Although there are several reasons why a major infrastructure project may be delayed (including applicant funding uncertainty and state and local reviews), over the past three years the Administration has undertaken an ambitious effort to modernize the Federal government’s role in permitting and review processes.</p>
<p>To ensure his Administration took action to modernize these permitting and review processes, on March 22, 2012, the President signed Executive Order 13604, Improving Performance of Federal Permitting and Review of Infrastructure Projects and subsequently a Presidential Memorandum on May 17, 2013, charging an interagency Steering Committee to lead the development of a plan to turn best practices into standard practice.  This Implementation Plan identifies four strategies, 15 reforms, and nearly 100 both near-term and long-term milestones.  The strategies are:</p>
<ul><li>Strategy 1: Institutionalize Interagency Coordination and Transparency, by formalizing interagency coordination policies, including early identification of a lead agency; synchronizing Federal review and permitting processes and decisions; standardizing the use of the Infrastructure Permitting Dashboard; and identifying best practices for early engagement with State, Local and Tribal governments.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Strategy 2:  Improve Project Planning, Siting, and Application Quality by developing tools to assist project applicants in planning for a major infrastructure project and support effective and timely decision-making by agency staff once the Federal processes begins. </li>

Advances in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) have long been central to our Nation’s ability to manufacture better and smarter products, improve health care, develop cleaner and more efficient domestic energy sources, preserve the environment, safeguard national security, and grow the economy. For the United States to maintain its preeminent position in the world it will be essential that the Nation continues to lead in STEM, but evidence indicates that current educational pathways are not leading to a sufficiently large and well-trained STEM workforce to achieve this goal, nor is the U.S. education system cultivating a culture of STEM education necessary for a STEM-literate public. Thus it is essential that the United States enhance U.S. students’ engagement in STEM disciplines and inspire and equip many more students to excel in STEM fields.</p>
<p>A number of Federal agencies place a high priority on STEM education and have developed education initiatives unique to their agency’s mission, needs, and resources.  To better leverage Federal assets, expertise, and partnerships toward a goal of national importance, a cross agency priority to improve STEM education has been developed to increase agency coordination and use of evidence-based approaches to improve P-12 STEM instruction, increase and sustain youth and public engagement in STEM, enhance the STEM experience of undergraduate students, better serve groups historically underrepresented in STEM fields, design graduate education for tomorrow’s STEM workforce, build new models for leveraging assets and expertise, and build and use evidence-based approaches. </p>

</div>  </div>  
  <div class="views-field views-field-field-cag-overview-revision-id">    <span class="views-label views-label-field-cag-overview-revision-id">Overview: </span>    <div class="field-content"><p>The American people deserve a Government that is responsive to their needs. Citizens and businesses expect government services to be well-designed, efficient, and generally comparable to the services they receive from leading private sector organizations. Whether they call the IRS for an answer to a tax question or visit a Social Security Administration office to adjust their benefits, they should experience high-quality interactions with the Federal Government. Despite some important strides to improve customer service over the past fifteen years, too often many Federal Government services fail to meet the expectations of citizens and business, creating unnecessary hassle and cost for citizens, businesses, and the government itself.  The Federal Government must keep pace with the public’s expectations and transform its customer services – soliciting regular customer feedback, streamlining processes, and delivering consistent quality service across customer channels.</p>
<p>To that end, in April 2011 the President issued an<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/27/executive-order-streamlining-service-delivery-and-improving-customer-ser" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/27/executive-order-streamlining-service-delivery-and-improving-customer-ser">Executive Order</a> requiring each agency to develop a customer service plan that identified implementation steps for their customer service activities, including a "signature initiative" that uses technology to improve the customer experience. Agencies posted the plans on their Open Government websites in October 2011, and this goal will build on these plans to streamline and improve customer service delivery.</p>
<p>To build upon the progress being made by individual agencies, the Administration is taking action to deliver improved customer service across the Federal enterprise.  The Administration will:</p>
<ul><li><em>Streamline transactions.</em>  Too often the processes and procedures of government have been developed piecemeal over time, and have not been regularly reexamined to ensure they are designed with the user experience in mind.  The Administration will identify transactions with a high impact on a significant number of citizens and streamline processes, better meet customer needs, and use performance measures to improve services.  This includes areas such as TSA security screening, veterans’ pension and disability applications, income-based repayment of student loans, Social Security, and taxpayer assistance.</li>
<li><em>Develop standards for high impact services.</em>  Citizen expectations for government services are continually increasing, driven by improvements in technology and the high quality services provided by the private sector.  Government leaders have a responsibility to understand customer expectations and service needs, and continually evaluate and improve their effectiveness in meeting those needs.  To facilitate this, many government programs that provide direct services to the public can benefit from setting customer service standards, clearly communicating these standards to customers, and ensuring these standards are being met.  The Administration will identify best practices in setting customer service standards, such as placing an emphasis on first contact resolution, and facilitate implementation of these practices for high impact services.</li>
<li><em>Utilize technology to improve the customer experience.</em>  The Administration will work to deliver world-class customer services to citizens by making it faster and easier for individuals and businesses to complete transactions with government online.  Given the continually growing importance of online services, the Administration has established a separate Cross-Agency Priority Goal to focus resources and attention on this priority area. </li>

The Administration will work with agencies to utilize existing authorities to attract top talent and consult with Agencies, the Office of Personnel Management, and Congressional stakeholders to expand the use of flexible hiring authorities. The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will also work with Agencies to incubate and scale new approaches to the design, development and delivery of top digital services and transactions.</li>
<li>Get the best companies working with government. The Administration’s efforts in this area will focus on streamlining the Federal IT acquisition process. Specific initiatives include creating more visibility of contracting opportunities for small, innovative companies; maximizing the use of available contracting flexibilities and best practices; and recommending administrative changes to the IT procurement processes.</li>
<li>Put the right processes and practices in place to drive outcomes and accountability. OMB will create and apply a new oversight and management process to highest impact IT investments in the Federal government. This process will include the best IT development and management approaches employed by the public and private sectors.  Lessons learned from this oversight process will be used to expand best practices across all agency IT investments.</li>

Today, proposals for contracts are lengthy, overly prescriptive, and laden with Government-specific requirements. There is also staggering duplication of contracts across Government and very little information sharing between agencies on pricing or other important contractual information. In order to fundamentally improve how taxpayer dollars are used in the Federal contracting space, the Administration is embarking on a comprehensive initiative to enhance collaboration and cooperation and drive greater innovation and improved performance through the implementation of Category Management.</p>
<p>This cross-agency priority (CAP) goal is focused on category management and will build on the progress made in the strategic sourcing initiative, leveraging the consolidated purchasing power of the Government to buy smarter and reduce duplication.  Category management is a new, more strategic approach that will enable the federal government to buy smarter and more like a single enterprise.  It involves identifying core areas of spend, developing heightened levels of expertise, leveraging shared best practices, providing streamlined solutions for acquisition, and managing supply and demand.  The objective is to increase efficiency and effectiveness while reducing costs and redundancies.  The first area of focus for category management is information technology and the CAP goal will support this initiative.  The objectives of the Category Management CAP goal will be expanded as the Category Management Leadership Council endorses other areas of focus.  The CAP Goal metrics can be found on the “supporting materials tabs” and progress updates will begin in the final Quarter of FY15.  </p>

If we are focused, committed, systematic, and intentional, we can make the sort of transformative changes in our service delivery approach that have altered the course of the commercial retail marketplace and reinvigorated American manufacturing. </p>
<p>We need to commit to driving efficiencies by creating opportunities to leverage existing resources and pool the government’s buying power.  This involves building common standards for underlying support activities and systems and driving out redundancy in administrative service provision.  It means changing agency expectations and incentives for spending.  And it means rethinking the way that the government considers and funds long-term investments in the systems and infrastructure that support customer service delivery. </p>
<p>The Federal Government will leverage the Executive Councils to develop common standards and benchmarks to measure shared service utilization, performance, and cost. Mandate those standards and benchmarks for common administrative services. From these standards and benchmarks we will drive efficiencies and greater performance by: 1) increasing the capacity of the Federal Shared Service Providers (SSPs) at DOI, USDA, Treasury, HHS, DOT and DOD; and 2) requiring use of lower-cost, higher-performing Shared Services for all agencies and SSPs which cannot meet established targets. We will target the following areas for Shared Services (listed in order of priority): financial, HR, technology, and acquisition.</p>

<p>The Administration will sustain and intensify these efforts in the second term by:</p>
<ul><li>Establishing cost and quality benchmarks for core/administrative operations, such as HR, Finance, Acquisition, and IT.  We will leverage the agency executive councils to develop common standards and benchmarks to measure shared service utilization, performance, and cost.  We will then use those standards and benchmarks for common administrative services as the baseline for driving continuous improvements in performance.</li>
<li>Cutting improper payments.

<p>The Administration has made significant progress in improving the management of information resources to increase interoperability and openness. In executive order 13642 President Obama outlined a clear vision for “Making Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information” wherever possible and legally permissible. The subsequently released Open Data Policy (OMB memorandum M-13-13) directed agencies to effectively “manage the information as a strategic asset” throughout its lifecycle and make data open by default to the extent permitted by law, while ensuring strict controls to safeguard individual privacy, confidentiality, and national security. </p>
<p>As a direct result, Americans are getting better access to government information and services they need. Homeowners who are struggling to pay their mortgages now get prompt, clear responses because companies are competing based on open consumer financial product complaint data published by CFPB, and can stay in their homes. Similarly, patients can now comparison shop to see which hospitals have the best outcomes and best prices thanks to data published by Medicaid and HHS—including a new dataset that for the first time shows what hospitals charge for inpatient services associated with the 100 most common kinds of hospital stays, revealing huge variations in hospital charges across the country and even within metro areas.</p>
<p>To drive further impact and results, the Open Data CAP Goal will focus on a series of government-wide objectives, strategies and major metrics that facilitate and gauge the outcome-oriented and management improvement goals of Open Data.  Metrics will prioritize three channels of impact measurement: impact on economic value creation organizations, impact on existing public program outcomes, and impact on internal government efficiency.  </p>

<p><strong>Physical Capital </strong></p>
<p>Through loans, grants, and technical assistance, the Department will provide support for decent housing and homeownership; health care, school, library, and safety investments; and broadband infrastructure in unserved and underserved areas.  USDA also supports utility deployment of smart grid, renewable energy, energy efficiency, and carbon capture and storage for maintaining reliable electric systems in rural communities.  Construction of electric, telecommunications, and water and waste system infrastructure and of farm storage facilities are also a priority for USDA.</p>
<p><strong>Human and Social Capital </strong></p>
<p>To assist rural residents to find jobs and start small business, USDA will provide educational opportunities, job training programs, and technical support and tools.  For youth, USDA promotes non-formal education programs, 4-H, and other youth development programs to transfer knowledge and develop leaders. The Department supports job corps centers and youth corps programs through the America’s Great Outdoors initiative.  Human and social capital formation is also assisted by USDA funding and oversight of rigorous agricultural research, education, and extension programs.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Capital</strong></p>
<p>To help build financial capital, USDA will undertake a variety of efforts.  The Department will pursue public -private partnerships including by structuring investment in rural communities to attract capital from third-party investors.  USDA will participate in marketing efforts to reach national lenders (capital markets) and leverage USDA resources with private capital.  USDA programs will provide business and industry development opportunities to develop a local economy and create well-paying jobs.  To facilitate strategic decision making to support livable communities, USDA will provide economic analyses and promote successful economic development models.  USDA will also provide equitable access to capital for rural minority farmers and business owners and target outreach to underserved and minority populations.</p>
<p><strong>Natural Capital</strong></p>
<p>Clean air, clean water, productive farmlands, and outdoor recreation opportunities result from USDA’s efforts working with partners and producers in our national forests and on working lands.  Goal 2 of this strategic plan provides a detailed look at USDA’s contributions to natural capital.</p>

                                                                                    <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>The economic vitality and quality of life in rural America depends on a healthy agricultural production system.  Farmers and ranchers face a challenging global, technologically advanced, and competitive business environment.  USDA works to ensure that producers are prosperous and competitive, have access to new markets, can manage their risks, and receive support in times of economic distress or weather-related disasters.</p>
<p><strong>Strengthen the Farm Financial Safety Net </strong></p>
<p>The Department strives to provide producers with prompt and equitable disaster assistance, income support payments, marketing assistance loans, farm loans, and risk management tools. USDA partners with commercial lenders to guarantee farm ownership and operating loans and makes direct loans to producers to purchase property or finance farm operating expenses.  USDA's loan programs are available to producers who are temporarily unable to obtain financing commercially.  The Federal Crop Insurance Program mitigates production and revenue losses from yield or price fluctuations and provides timely indemnity payments.</p>
<p>To further strengthen the farm financial safety net, USDA will:</p>
<ul><li>Improve partnerships with other agricultural lenders to better leverage limited funding resources;</li>
<li>Expand crop insurance availability and product coverage, especially for livestock, pasture, rangeland, forage, organic, and specialty crops;</li>
<li>Use geographical information systems (GIS), remote sensing, precision agriculture, and data mining to improve crop insurance products and program integrity;</li>
<li>Provide timely disaster relief to producers using available programs, use GIS to assess damage rapidly,  and partner with other agencies on disaster relief outreach and;</li>
<li>Expand outreach for farm storage facility loans to biomass, fruit, and vegetable producers.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Facilitate Access to International Markets</strong></p>
<p>USDA expands and protects international market opportunities and connects agricultural exporters to customers.  The Department works to strengthen the global rules-based trading system and supports development of international standards to facilitate safe trade.  Cooperative efforts with other U.S. Government agencies and industries ensure that America’s producers have fair market access, understanding of key market trends, and support to overcome market barriers.  To address the threats to international trade posed by high-consequence animal and plant pests and pathogens, USDA supports research, education, and extension programs, and networked regulatory, surveillance, and rapid response capabilities.</p>
<p>USDA works with exporters, importers, and other end-users of U.S. agricultural products around the world to facilitate sales in global markets.  In cooperation with other U.S. government agencies, USDA monitors and investigates discrepancies reported by importing countries on the quality or weight of U.S. grains, oilseeds, and related products.</p>
<p>To further facilitate access to international markets, USDA will:</p>
<ul><li>Stimulate greater involvement by small- and medium-sized enterprises selling U.S. agricultural products;</li>
<li>Negotiate and implement trade agreements and support international equivalency agreements;</li>
<li>Facilitate the overseas marketing efforts of U.S. commodity organizations; and</li>
<li>Reduce technical barriers to trade and eliminate sanitary and phytosanitary barriers not based on sound science.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Support the Development of New Domestic Markets</strong></p>
<p>Accessing domestic markets helps build financial sustainability for producers and provides fresh, local food for consumers.  USDA supports the planning, coordination, and education necessary for thriving regional food systems and replication of successful models. USDA will work closely with partners to develop and revitalize infrastructure for regional food systems. This includes innovative new opportunities and proven approaches like cooperatives and farmers markets.  USDA analyzes market trends and provides tools to help producers identify opportunities.  USDA also oversees national standards for the production and handling of agricultural products labeled as organic.  To increase the number of certified organic operations, USDA will support research and education that enables organic production; reduce overlapping requirements; eliminate other obstacles; and collaborate with others to make certification more feasible for small and beginning farmers and business.</p>
<p><strong>Ensure a Financially Sustainable and Competitive Agricultural System</strong></p>
<p>USDA manages farm price support and commodity purchase programs to help balance supply and demand and conducts oversight to protect producers from unfair competition and unfair business practices in the livestock, meat, and poultry markets. Working with the Department of Justice, USDA enforces fair market practices and takes action against anti-competition behavior, to create a level playing field for producers.</p>
<p>The Department ensures efficient marketing of agricultural products through clear and consistent descriptions and measurements of the grade, quality and quantity of products that are bought and sold.  By providing current, unbiased statistics, price and sales information USDA assists in the orderly marketing and distribution of farm commodities to inform decision-making by agricultural producers and agribusinesses and to ensure market stability.  USDA will ensure that USDA-approved and licensed warehouse programs maintain adequate storage facilities, adequate frequency of warehouse examinations, and reduced product losses.  USDA foods will be delivered in a timely manner, within contract specifications, and at competitive prices.</p>
<p>USDA develops and maintains national standards for the production and handling of agricultural products labeled as organic and examines and accredits State and private organic certifying agents.  By providing education resources on organics to producers through its field offices, USDA will better serve diverse management systems including organic and specialty crops.</p>
<p>The Department works to ensure that minority, women, beginning, and other socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers have full knowledge and access to its programs. USDA also works with producer and farmworker organizations and the U.S. Department of Labor to improve working conditions and income for farmworkers.</p>
<p><strong>Increase the Number of Certified Organic Operations and Expand Programs and Services for Organic Producers</strong><br />
USDA will support research and education that enables organic production; reduce overlapping requirements; and collaborate with others to make certification more feasible for small and beginning farmers and businesses.</p>
<p><strong>Protect the Foundations of the Agricultural System</strong></p>
<p>USDA provides leadership in creating and disseminating knowledge spanning the biological, physical, and social sciences through agricultural research, economic analysis, statistics, and partnerships with Cooperative Extension, and higher education institutions.  The Department conducts research, education, and extension programming to reduce the costs of agricultural inputs and to improve crop and animal production efficiency and practices.  Research efforts lead to more thorough assessments of Americans’ nutritional needs; new methods for sustaining a competitive agricultural economy; and a better understanding of how to enhance the natural resource base.  Research priorities include improving agriculturally important plants and animals, including those resilient to anticipated changes in climate.  USDA will use the cooperative extension system to transfer technology and best practices from the laboratory into active use.</p>
<p>In coordination with Federal partners, USDA helps higher-education institutions with undergraduate and graduate programs in agriculture develop strong science, technology, engineering, and math curriculums, and increase enrollment in secondary and two-year post-secondary programs, especially from underrepresented groups.  As part of USDA’s science leadership, the Department will continue to provide Sustainable Agricultural Research and Education grants for projects designed to help America’s two million small- and medium scale producers improve their knowledge of sustainable agriculture production and marketing practices <a href="http://prep3.uat.performance.reisys.com/node/830/edit#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>

This supports the Administration’s goal to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020.</p>
<p>USDA will encourage voluntary practices to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions.  These include conservation tillage; manure and nutrient management; fertilizer efficiency; planting trees; minimizing deforestation; increasing energy efficiency in agriculture and rural development; and developing renewable sources of energy.  Forest restoration, along with conservation easements and land acquisition, will help maintain forests as a net carbon sink.</p>
<p>The Department will assist rural communities, producers, resource managers, and community planners to develop and implement climate adaptation strategies.  Impacts that are already appearing include changing water flow, availability, and quality; fire risk; and extreme weather events. USDA will monitor impacts and help implement adaptations (e.g., measuring changes in water flow and then installing stream buffers or upgrading culverts to handle increased water overflow).</p>
<p>The Department conducts and invests in research to inform climate change policy and mitigation and adaptation strategies, tools and technologies.  USDA will evaluate the effects of conservation actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to identify effective and economic approaches.  USDA is supporting plant variety and animal breed development that maximize carbon sequestration and can adapt to climate change.  Work is also underway to develop methods and technical guidelines to measure and model the effects of climate change on ecosystem services and to conduct greenhouse gas inventories of the urban forest and agriculture sector.  The Department and its partners will make research outcomes widely available through outreach and extension networks.</p>

The largest contributors to insufficient in-country production are chronic under-investment in agriculture, inefficient inputs and markets, and poor governance.</p>
<p>USDA supports global and national security policy through development and capacity-building of sustainable agricultural systems in the developing world.  USDA’s promotes sustainable, market-led growth across the entire food production and market chain. The Department uses a cooperative approach to make strategic investments to strengthen countries’ capacity to participate in international markets, thus expanding demand for U.S. agricultural products and enhancing global food security.</p>
<p>USDA’s Food for Progress Program increases productivity and expands trade of agricultural products along the value chain, while the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education program improves literacy, health, hygiene, and nutrition practices of school-aged beneficiaries in targeted countries.  Improving the education of women is especially important due to their critical links with economic growth, health, nutrition, and improved living standards for future generations.</p>
<p>USDA will assist priority countries to increase capacity to develop sustainable agricultural systems and markets.  This includes providing advice on developing and adopting market and science-based policies and institutions and building trade capacity.  The Department helps countries create an enabling environment for increased private-sector participation in agricultural value chains, while leveraging partnerships with U.S. government agencies, land grant universities, other institutions, and the private sector to conduct technical assistance and training.</p>
<p>USDA will invest in research, development, and extension to improve agricultural techniques and technologies, including biotechnology.  Data and analysis from USDA will assist with addressing food security including market analysis, and food security assessments for food insecure countries.  The Department will assist developing countries in establishing robust agricultural statistics programs through technical assistance and training.  To support the sustainable management of soil, USDA will: disseminate soil science information and technology; build capacity to conduct soil surveys; and promote the adoption of data, technology and science-based solutions for soil management.  Many of these activities are carried out collaboratively with funding partners, such as the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Department of State, Department of Defense, and Millennium Challenge Corporation.</p>
<p>The Department promotes agricultural policy and regulatory programs to strengthen food safety and animal and plant health systems, which help countries take advantage of new trade and marketing opportunities.  At the same time, promotion of these policies and programs reduce the worldwide prevalence of significant diseases.</p>
<p>USDA is a key partner in President Obama’s Feed the Future Initiative, a global food security and nutrition initiative led by USAID.  The three key areas in which USDA will contribute at the country and global levels for sustained and enhanced impact include: a) in-country capacity building efforts with government, farmer organizations, the private sector, and universities on agricultural policies, regulatory systems including sanitary and phytosanitary systems, natural resources management, and agribusiness, market chains and trade; b) basic and applied research, including extension; and c) market information, statistics, data, and economic analysis.</p>

American farmers are among the most productive in the world, and U.S. science is among the most advanced in developing innovative solutions to agro-ecological challenges.  USDA supports the safe and appropriate use of science and technology, including biotechnology, to help meet agricultural challenges and market needs of the 21st century.</p>
<p>USDA uses science-based regulatory systems to allow for the safe development, use, and trade of products derived from new agricultural technologies.  USDA will continue to regulate the importation, interstate movement, and field-testing of newly developed genetically engineered (GE) organisms that qualify as “regulated articles” to ensure they do not pose a threat to plant health before they can be commercialized.  These science-based evaluations facilitates the safe introduction of new agricultural production options, and enhance public and international confidence in these products.  USDA will coordinate responsibilities with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as part of the Federal Coordinated Framework for the Regulation of Biotechnology.</p>
<p>To bring products of new and emerging technologies to the worldwide marketplace, USDA works with other federal agencies to address trade challenges while building strong international partnerships.  These efforts facilitate the safe use and trade of products produced by such technologies, including the genetic engineering of animals, animal cloning, next generation plant and animal biotechnologies and nanotechnology.  USDA will continue to monitor and encourage industry efforts to enable the development and export of biotechnology products containing intellectual property whose patents have expired.</p>
<p>USDA supports global adoption of science-based regulatory systems and works to advance internationally accepted science-based regulations with U.S. trading partners.   Ensuring the enforcement of existing global commitments governing trade in agricultural biotechnology products is also a priority for the Department.  USDA raises awareness of the contributions of innovative technologies to global food and energy security, environmental sustainability, and climate change mitigation and adaptation.  This fosters global adoption of these technologies and their products, increases trade opportunities for U.S producers, and provides tools for addressing 21st century challenges to agriculture.</p>
<p>At the same time, USDA facilitates increased dialogue and cooperation among farmers who employ varied agricultural production methods. This leads to domestic and international growth for all production systems and reduces friction among diverse interests.  USDA will implement, as appropriate, recommendations provided by the USDA Advisory Committee on Biotechnology and 21<sup>st</sup> Century Agriculture on strengthening coexistence among different agricultural systems.</p>

<p>USDA’s domestic nutrition assistance programs serve one in four Americans annually. The Department is committed to making benefits available to every eligible person who wishes to participate in the major nutrition assistance programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the Child Nutrition Programs, and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).  While the Department’s ultimate objective is for economic opportunities to make nutrition assistance unnecessary for as many families as possible, we will ensure that these vital programs remain ready to serve all eligible people who need them.</p>
<p>While the rate of SNAP participation among eligible people has returned to the coverage levels of the 1990s, a substantial portion of those eligible for SNAP are not participating. USDA will continue its efforts to ensure that every eligible person is aware of the program’s benefits so that they can make an informed choice whether to participate or not.</p>
<p>USDA also intends to ensure effective and easy access to the Child Nutrition Programs for eligible children who need them. The National School Lunch Program is available in most schools. Schools can receive cash subsidies and donated commodities from the Department for each meal they serve. In return, those schools must serve lunches that meet Federal requirements and offer free or reduced-price lunches to eligible children.</p>
<p>Promoting access to nutrition assistance goes hand-in-hand with managing these programs in a manner that ensures public confidence and maximizes the impact of Federal dollars. Strong management ensures that those most in need of nutrition assistance receive it. It also ensures that nutrition assistance programs leverage opportunities to positively impact the local economy in the communities they serve. Finally, it ensures that resources are not wasted by error or abuse. USDA uses all available opportunities, including new communication and eGovernment technologies, to serve customers, work with partners, and administer programs as effectively as possible.</p>

The First Lady’s <em>Let’s Move!</em> campaign has been central to this effort, and USDA will continue to play a critical role in its success. In addition, USDA is fighting to reverse the rapid increase in childhood obesity by improving school meals and the school nutrition environment. On school days, children who participate in both the breakfast and lunch programs consume as many as half of their calories at school. The Department must ensure that all foods served in school contribute to good health, and the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act provided new authority to set common-sense nutrition standards for food sold throughout the school day. USDA will work with schools to implement the new standards for all foods sold in school, and will continue to support ongoing implementation of updated school meals nutrition standards.</p>
<p>USDA is also encouraging and supporting WIC mothers to breastfeed their infants by strengthening breastfeeding policy and program activities. Breastfeeding is linked to a lower risk of numerous health problems for both mother and infant. It also may have a protective effect against pediatric overweight and obesity. Breast milk provides the best source of infant nutrition and helps infants get a healthy start in life. USDA will recognize and reward State achievements in promoting breastfeeding through performance awards, expand the availability of peer-counseling in WIC clinics, and continue its core promotion and support activities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, USDA is working to double the number of Americans who eat five or more servings of fruits and vegetables daily. Too many Americans simply do not eat enough of these nutrient-dense foods to support good nutrition. The Department establishes evidence-based nutrition guidance, the basis for which is the <em>Dietary Guidelines for Americans</em> (DGA), which are developed in partnership with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p>The Department is also working to improve access to healthful, locally produced food in under-served communities through a multifaceted strategy that focuses on food production, distribution, and both traditional and non-traditional retail options. Through research and technical and financial assistance, the Department will help producers produce, distribute and market healthy foods locally. The Department will also encourage additional farmers markets in low-access areas to become authorized SNAP vendors, equip markets to accept SNAP through electronic benefit transfer (EBT), work with local and private partners to test and expand the use of incentive programs for healthy food purchases, and promote greater use of farmers markets by SNAP participants. Through its farm-to-school efforts, USDA also connects schools with regional and local producers to increase producers’ market opportunities as well as young people’s access to healthy, local foods.</p>
<p>To improve Americans’ physical activity behaviors, USDA is promoting the use of the Nation’s public lands. Most Americans need to move more to promote their health and well-being and improve the energy balance between the calories they consume and those they expend. National forests and grasslands are America’s backyard, offering chances to increase physical activity. Over 90 million National Forest System visitors participate in outdoor-based physical activities each year. USDA will promote the use of these lands and facilities to nurture the body and mind in natural settings near local communities. The Department also will increase access to green space through such programs as the Forest Service’s Urban and Community Forestry program.</p>

Effective response to food safety issues and enforcement depend upon timely, quality data and analysis.</p>
<p>USDA conducts in-commerce surveillance activities to protect public health by ensuring that meat, poultry, and processed egg products are safe, secure, wholesome, correctly labeled and packaged.  In fiscal year 2012, USDA ensured public health requirements were met in establishments that slaughter or process 147 million head of livestock and 8.9 billion poultry carcasses.  In the same year, USDA estimated that there were 479,621 <em>Salmonella</em>, <em>Listeria monocytgenes (Lm)</em>, and <em>Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157:H7</em> foodborne illnesses attributed to Department-regulated products.</p>
<p>USDA also measures industry adoption of functional food defense plans.  Food defense plans are written procedures that official meat and poultry slaughter and processing establishments, egg product plants, and official import inspection establishments should follow to protect the food supply from intentional contamination of food products with chemicals, biological agents, or other harmful substances.  These plans help the industry protect public health and reduce negative economic impacts on the food infrastructure.</p>
<p>Finally, as imported products and on-farm practices can dramatically impact food safety, USDA participates in and leads government-wide Codex Alimentarius activities to ensure that science-based international public health standards are in place, promotes use of Codex standards by other governments and international producers, conducts re-inspection of imported products and audits foreign countries to ensure the safety of imported products and provides guidance to promote good agricultural practices on the farm.  The Codex Committee on Food Hygiene (chaired by the U.S.) also adopted Guidelines for the Control of <em>Campylobacter</em> and <em>Salmonella</em> in chicken meat in 2011.  The guidelines are consistent with USDA hygienic performance standards and will help ensure the safety of imported products.</p>

By September 30, 2017, USDA will continue to implement and monitor progress of modeled science-based practices that improve soil health and sustainability. Nationwide, the soil health practices that are consistent with the Secretary’s Climate Change Mitigation Building Blocks will store (sequester) more than 8.8 million metric tons of carbon per year or more than 32 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e).  </p>
<p>Based on results generated by EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator (<a href="http://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator">http://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator</a>), the carbon sequestration benefits of an additional 32 million metric tons of CO2e annually would offset an estimated: 76 billion miles driven by passenger cars, or 3.6 billion gallons of gasoline consumed, or 4.4 million homes electricity use emissions for one year. Soil health practice implementation will also increase resilience during seasons with extreme weather, in comparison to fields that are not using such practices.</p>

                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>The world population is expected to rise from approximately 7 billion in 2013 to over 9 billion by 2050.  To sustain this rate of growth, we must provide as much food in the next 40 years as has been grown in the last 500 years.  From 1982 to 2007, over 41 million acres of rural land was lost to development (the size of Illinois and New Jersey combined).  Approximately 23 million acres of this was active agricultural land, and 14 million acres was prime farmland.</p>
<p>At the same time that we need to grow more food on a shrinking available land base, we are also asking more and more of our farmers and ranchers.  We ask that they help reduce our Nation’s dependency on fossil fuels by growing more bioenergy crops, that they provide adequate pollinator habitat (required for about 35% of our food supply), that they protect water quality, and that they incorporate management practices and technologies that optimize efficiencies of water and nutrient use.  In addition, while addressing these needs, producers are increasingly faced with extreme weather events, ranging from drought to flood.</p>
<p>Improving soil health allows us to simultaneously address these and other pressing natural resource needs.  Improving soil health allows us to improve water quality, increase soil water availability, enhance resilience to extreme weather, enhance nutrient cycling, increase carbon sequestration, provide wildlife habitat (including pollinators), enhance rural economic opportunity, and meet the food and fiber production needs of a rapidly growing population on a shrinking available land base.  Simply stated, improving the health of our Nation’s soils is one of the most important things we can do for this and for future generations.</p>
<p>USDA assists agricultural producers with improving soil health through increased knowledge, education, and technical and financial assistance in implementing soil health management systems.  The research and educational activities conducted by USDA and its partners contribute much more than a body of knowledge. The information is integrated into policies that lead to the development of science-based standards and specifications for management practices, used for appropriate implementation of practices. The practices can then be combined in a systems approach, to form customized location-specific plans for conserving selected resources.  Such conservation plans are applied by land managers to improve soil health.  In addition, the impact of implementing these standardized practices can be measured and modeled nationally, especially when combined with land, soil, climate, and other data.</p>

education and outreach around this important issue. By September 30, 2017, USDA will promote the health of honey bees and other pollinators by restoring an additional 1 million acres of pollinator habitat.</p>
</p>
                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>Wherever flowering plants flourish, pollinating bees, birds, butterflies, bats, and other animals are hard at work, providing vital but often unnoticed services. Some three-fourths of all native plants in the world require pollination by an animal, most often an insect, and most often a native bee. The attributed value of crops in the United States that are directly dependent on insect pollination was estimated at $15.12 billion in 2009, including an estimated $11.68 billion of crop value directly attributable to honey bees.</p>
<p>But many pollinators are in serious decline in the United States and worldwide. Preventing continued losses of our country’s pollinators requires immediate national attention, as pollinators play a critical role in maintaining diverse ecosystems and in supporting agricultural production. Unabated, these losses of our pollinators threaten agricultural production, the maintenance of natural plant communities, and the important services provided by those ecosystems, such as carbon cycling, flood and erosion control, and recreation. Restoring, enhancing and conserving pollinator habitat can mitigate pollinator losses by providing abundant sources of  pollen and nectar, and space for other essential niche requirements, such as nesting sites.</p>
<p>USDA has the capacity to improve and expand pollinator habitat through two private landowner incentive programs: Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP).</p>

                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>American agriculture is at a critical juncture of need and opportunity for the next generation of farmers and ranchers. New and beginning farmers and ranchers are a fundamental part of the American and global agricultural marketplace and legacy. However, according to the most recent Census of Agriculture, in 2012, the United States had 522,058 beginning farmers (principal operators who were on their current operation ten years or less). This was 20 percent fewer than in 2007, when the last agriculture census was conducted. Additionally, consistent with the 30 year trend, the average age of a principal operator has continued to rise – and is at 58.3 years old nationwide. While USDA is working to understand additional nuance and gain a deeper picture of all the parts of the next generation of agriculture, these are important trends of note. Information from USDA’s 2015 Tenure, Ownership, and Transition of Agricultural Land report also evaluated the impending transition of agricultural land to the next generation – in the next five years, almost 10 percent (or 91 million acres) of all farmland is expected to transition, not including the 57.1 million acres that landowners have put or plan to put into wills. These trends stand to have a significant effect on the structure of the agricultural economy and rural communities. </p>
<p>Targeted outreach and increased investment in the next generation, proposed here by USDA, will serve to support new and beginning farmers and strengthen USDA’s ongoing efforts to assist beginning farmers in accessing capital, acquiring land, developing financially sustainable operations, and fully utilizing USDA programs – supporting the next generation of American agriculture.</p>
<p>Since 2009, USDA has engaged its resources to support a strong next generation of farmers and ranchers by improving access to land and capital; building new markets and market opportunities; extending new conservation opportunities; offering appropriate risk management tools; and increasing our outreach, education, and technical support. Specifically, from 2009-2014, USDA increased our investment in new and beginning farmers across several key programs by 14.1%. The 2014 Farm Bill gave USDA new tools and flexibility in several key programs in order to support new and beginning farmers and ranchers, by continuing, increasing, and creating new assistance for this group.</p>
<p>USDA is proposing to increase and broaden access for new farmers even further over the next two years – an additional 6.6% across key programs – for a total increased investment value of about $5.6 billion. Including the additional investment, by September 30, 2017, USDA will have invested roughly $17.4 billion to beginning farmers and ranchers.</p>
<p>USDA will focus our work on the most relevant programs across the Department (excluding disaster assistance programs due to their unique nature of benefit). These programs were chosen for their impact on increasing opportunity for new and beginning farmers and ranchers and support for increased longevity of new and beginning operations.</p>
<p>• For the purposes of our goal, increased opportunity is defined as the opportunity to begin an operation, grow an operation, develop new markets, support more effective agricultural or conservation practices, or having access to relevant training and education opportunities.</p>
<p>• Increased longevity refers to support for new and beginning farmers during critical development periods, including the transition from a brand new operation to a more experienced level of beginning farming, and then finally graduating from being a beginning farmer to an experienced farm operator.</p>
<p>Additionally, USDA works closely with other Federal partners that have a role in supporting new businesses, including agricultural operations.  USDA will collaborate closely with them in the achievement of this goal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong>  The numbers contained in the goal statement represent both dedicated programmatic funding and programmatic utilization by new and beginning farmers.  We refer to this blended number as general “access” to USDA programs.  </p>

                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>A plentiful supply of safe and nutritious food is essential to the well-being of every family and the healthy development of every child in America. Scientific research has established strong links between diet, health, and productivity.  Even small improvements in the average diet may yield significant health and economic benefits.</p>
<p>Yet we know that for a significant number of American families, a lack of sufficient food and nutrition remains a serious problem.  While most American households always have access to enough nutritious food for an active and healthy lifestyle, the latest data show that about 7.5 million American households with children, accounting for over 15.3 million children, had difficulty putting enough food on the table at some point during 2014. Even more alarming, in more than 400,000 households, with more than 914,000 children, one or more children simply did not get enough to eat.  At times during the year, these children were hungry, skipped meals, or went whole days without food. </p>
<p>USDA’s domestic nutrition assistance programs serve one in four Americans annually.  The Department is committed to making benefits available to every eligible person who wishes to participate in the major nutrition assistance programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the Child Nutrition Programs, and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Too often people who need benefits do not participate, because they do not know they are eligible, do not realize the size and value of benefits available to them, or believe applying is too difficult or burdensome.  While the Department’s ultimate objective is for economic opportunities to make nutrition assistance unnecessary for as many families as possible, we are working to ensure these vital programs remain ready to serve all eligible people who need them and to eliminate barriers to access for eligible Americans.</p>
<p>In particular, USDA is working to ensure eligible children have effective and easy access to the Child Nutrition Programs. The National School Lunch Program is available in most schools, but not all eligible children participate. Some bring healthful food from home, while others, especially in high schools, may be foregoing a nutritious lunch entirely.  In addition, the School Breakfast Program (SBP) operates much like the National School Lunch Program, except the program may not be reaching all the children who need it for a number of reasons, including limited time in the school schedule and potential stigma. Eating a healthy breakfast, at home or at school, is linked to better educational performance and classroom behavior, and fewer visits to the school nurse. Therefore, USDA is focused on improving participation in SBP.  We are also focused on improving access to nutritious food for children during the summer months when school meals are not available, and the risk of hunger increases. We’ve made it a priority to expand access to summer meals with creative approaches so that children and teens can access nutritious food .</p>
<p>The Department is working to improve access to and the nutritional quality of benefits in these programs. These efforts seek to ensure that healthful and palatable food is available to every student to support his/her health, growth, and learning.</p>

<p> a) increase the percentage of USDA funding in StrikeForce areas by 10 percent from 2010 baseline $4 billion and; </p>
<p>b) leverage $1 billion of outside resources from baseline in high poverty areas over two years.</p>
</p>
                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>Currently, 85 percent of our country’s persistent poverty counties are in rural America.  More than one third of rural Americans and one in four rural American children live in poverty.  Kids growing up in families earning even twice the poverty threshold are nearly three times as likely as other children to have poor health, are more likely to finish two fewer years of school, and earn half as much money in their adult life.</p>
<p>Growing the economy by investing in rural communities and increasing opportunities for families is critical to our Nation’s future.  Capacity building is essential in these persistent poverty rural areas.  By doing so, it enables these communities to increase its readiness for access to USDA’s grant and loan programs as well as leveraging other resources to fund and implement projects and strategies that will spur economic growth. </p>
<p>Starting in FY2016, USDA Rural Development will implement <strong>Farm Bill’s Section 6025 Strategic Economic Development</strong> which enables Business &amp; Industry Guaranteed Loan, Rural Business Development Grant, Community Facilities, and Water and Environmental Programs to set aside up to 10% of its appropriated funds for prioritizing projects that implement multi-jurisdictional community economic development plans.  In high poverty areas, community planning is a critical step for identifying needs, opportunities, resources, &amp; strategies, building partnerships, and identifying the right processes, structure, and leadership to execute milestones and achieve economic goals.  Through USDA’s <strong>Stronger Economies Together (SET) Initiative</strong> and other federal planning programs, we are delivering training and technical assistance so high poverty rural communities can start or update their community economic development plans, build their local capacity, and have increased opportunity to access Section 6025 and other federal programs.  In FY2015, we have 75 SET Regions who are actively developing or updating their community economic development plans, which we aim to increase to a 100 by September 30, 2017.  These SET Regions along with other high poverty rural and tribal communities with multi-jurisdictional plans can compete for Section 6025 and have the opportunity to fund and implement their projects in a way that align and in support of the community or the region’s economic development and poverty reduction priorities.  As we lay the framework and build the 6025 program, USDA should be able to report by September 30, 2017 number of SET Regions and multi-jurisdictional plans adopted under SET and number of economic development projects supported, implemented, and funded due to 6025 in high poverty communities. </p>
<p>Moreover, the <strong>StrikeForce Initiative for Rural Growth and Opportunity</strong> was created in 2010 to address specific challenges associated with rural poverty.  Since then, USDA teams have collaborated with more than 1,000 community partners and public entities to bring targeted assistance to rural areas experiencing chronic poverty.  These efforts have helped create jobs, build homes, feed kids, assist farmers and conserve natural resources in StrikeForce designated states.  By September 30, 2017, USDA will increase the funding in StrikeForce areas by 10 percent from the 2009 baseline of $4 billion and leverage $1 billion of outside resources for investment in high poverty areas.</p>
<p>To complement, USDA has also established <strong>Poverty Targeting</strong> goals for each of its State Office with an overall FY2015 goal of 22% of Rural Development’s program funding to be invested in high poverty rural areas.  This ensured that our Strikeforce and other States with persistent poverty are given reasonable priority and that Rural Development invests available program funding in areas that need it the most.  And in many cases, other non-federal dollars must be leveraged to sufficiently fund projects that will help build capacity and spur economic growth.  <strong>Program leveraging</strong> is essential, it ensures partnership building and utilization of other capital so high poverty communities can have adequate assets to fully support the well-being of its community members.</p>
<p>And lastly, USDA in partnership with the White House Rural Council have been taking a comprehensive look at how its policies impact the way rural areas develop and how well those places support the people who live there, in all aspects of their lives – education, health, housing, business, energy, and transportation.  This “place-based” approach is an effort to help places work better for people.  An effective place-based policy requires comprehensive interagency collaboration and investment that can ensure an increased impact of federal dollars and a greater return on federal investments. By concentrating resources, this approach asserts the primacy of place in moving our nation towards more robust social and economic outcomes.  In FY2014, President Obama announced the <strong>Promise Zones</strong>, a place-based initiative.  USDA and HUD jointly support the coordination and implementation of the Promise Zone objectives.  As of FY2015, there are 13 Promise Zone designees, of which four are Rural and Tribal.  USDA leads the application, review, and implementation support (i.e. planning, training and technical assistance, matching their needs with the appropriate financing tools to fund projects, etc.) for these Rural and Tribal designees.  By September 30, 2017, there will be two additional Rural and Tribal designees.   </p>

<p>By September 30, 2015, FSIS will reduce the total estimated number of foodborne <strong><em>Salmonella</em></strong> illnesses caused by FSIS-regulated products to 357,515 illnesses from a 2007-2009 baseline of 413,965 illnesses.</p>
<p>The FY 2015 target aligns with the established FSIS “All-Illness Measure” that seeks an ambitious reduction in <em>Salmonella, E. coli </em>O157:H7, and <em>Listeria monocytogenes (</em>Lm<em>) </em>illnesses concurrent with illness reductions identified in the Department of Health and Human Services Healthy People 2020 Initiative.</p>
</p>
                               <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p><em>Salmonella</em> is the leading known cause of bacterial foodborne illness and death in the U.S. causing an estimated 1.3 million illnesses, and between 400 and 500 deaths annually.  FSIS estimates that, in Q4, FY2013, approximately 393,000 <em>Salmonella</em> illnesses were associated with Agency-regulated products.</p>
<p>Preventing <em>Salmonella</em> infections depends on actions taken to reduce contamination of food by the food industry, regulatory agencies, and consumers, as well as actions taken for detecting and responding to outbreaks when they occur. FSIS, a public health regulatory agency within the USDA, is responsible for ensuring that the commercial supply of meat, poultry, and processed egg products moving in interstate commerce or exported to other countries is safe, secure, wholesome, and correctly labeled and packaged.</p>
<p>This Agency Priority Goal (APG) tracks an established FSIS performance measure known as the “All-Illness Measure” that estimates the total number of illnesses from <em>Salmonella</em>, <em>Listeria monocytogenes (Lm)</em>, and <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7 from all FSIS-regulated products. FSIS estimates that approximately 33% of all salmonellosis is associated with FSIS regulated products* and that <em>Salmonella</em> comprises approximately 95% of all estimated illnesses in the All-Illness Measure.  This corporate performance measure is included in the USDA Strategic Plan and the FSIS Strategic Plan for 2011-2016. FSIS Program Area actions designed to achieve the goal are included in the FSIS Annual Performance Plan.  This APG specifically tracks and reports on reductions in <em>Salmonella</em> illnesses.</p>
<p>FSIS will attempt to achieve the ambitious reduction in <em>Salmonella</em> illnesses called for in this APG through the implementation of the 2013 FSIS Strategic Performance Working Group (SPWG) Action Plan for <em>Salmonella</em>, along with existing FSIS activities focused on reducing <em>Salmonella</em> contamination on regulated product.</p>
<p>Additionally, FSIS works closely with other Federal agencies that have a role in protecting the food supply, including both the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); FSIS has worked with these agencies on a Priority Goal to reduce <em>Salmonella</em> Enteritidis illnesses from FDA-regulated shell eggs.   FSIS also works with sister agencies within USDA, including the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), and USDA’s research agencies such as the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Economic Research Service (ERS), and National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) in protecting the food supply.</p>
<p>This goal relates directly to the USDA Strategic Plan goal 4.3, “Protect Public Health by Ensuring Food is Safe”, to ensure that all of America’s children have access to safe, nutritious, and balanced meals.</p>
<p><em>*At the time FSIS developed and submitted its Agency Priority Goal, the most recent outbreak data the Agency had to calculate foodborne illness attribution was from 2008-2010 (33% for Salmonella).  In the subsequent quarter, FSIS received new outbreak data from the CDC, which allowed the Agency to estimate a new attribution fraction for 2009-2011, which for Salmonella was 31.7%.  </em></p>

<ul><li>Provide credit assistance to 7,000 small and family operations, women, minority, and beginning farmers and ranchers through its Microloan program;</li>
<li>Provide 3 percent of RBS funding to companies that produce or manufacture biobased products; and</li>
<li>Provide assistance to develop the infrastructure for 450 new markets for local and regional food.</li>
</ul></p>
                               <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>Although export opportunities and agricultural revenue are at historic highs, rural America continues to lose population.  A continued population drain from rural areas jeopardizes the economic stability of rural America and the many national assets that rural communities have historically stewarded.  In order to reverse the trend, USDA is investing in creating opportunities with potential to catalyze long-term economic growth and prosperity in rural America.  Areas of opportunity include supporting new and beginning farmers and ranchers, the bioeconomy, and local and regional food systems.</p>
<p>To achieve the goal, USDA will make strategic investments in the following areas:</p>
<ul><li><u>New and Beginning Farmers and Ranchers</u>:  The Microloan program operated by the Farm Service Agency (FSA) is designed to help small and family operations, beginning, minority, and women farmers and ranchers to secure loans under $50,000 (Effective December 2014).  It is aimed at bolstering the progress of producers through their start-up years by providing needed resources and helping to increase equity so that farmers may eventually graduate to commercial credit and expand their operations. The Microloan program provides a less burdensome, simpler application process in comparison to traditional farm operating loans.  In addition, for those who want to grow niche crops to sell directly to ethnic markets and local farmers markets, the Microloan program offers a path to obtain financing.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul><li><u>Biobased Companies</u>:  USDA provides funding for biobased products, from the production of the renewable biomass feedstock through the sale of the resulting biobased product, including research and development for production, capital for startup businesses, and marketing and outreach.  USDA invests in the discovery and refinement of the best feedstocks and production systems for biomass through its research and development programs and partnerships.  Further, USDA provides financial and technical assistance to rural individuals, businesses, and communities to aid in sustainably producing and distributing renewable biomass resources.  USDA also leads the Federal effort to designate biobased products for preferred Federal procurement.  It is through these investments and partnerships that USDA will make strategic investment to support the creation of new biobased companies and associated economic opportunities in the coming years.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul><li><u>Local and Regional Food Systems</u>:  USDA supports the development of physical infrastructure, often in partnership with private lenders, and provides technical assistance in marketing, risk management, food safety practices and other areas. The Department also works to reach stakeholders who are unaware of available federal resources and works internally to ensure that USDA programs and policies meet the unique needs of local and regional supply chains. The long-term result will be job growth driven by a maturing market and accessible infrastructure to aggregate, process, and distribute local and regionally-produced foods.</li>

                               <p><span class="acc_content_label">Statement:</span><p>By September 30, 2015, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will develop, demonstrate, and implement science-based practices to improve soil health and sustainability that, nationwide, will reduce carbon loss on cropland by over 100,000 tons per year and increase corn and soybean production by over 5 percent on those fields implementing soil health practices.</p>
</p>
                               <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>The world population is expected to rise from approximately 7 Billion in 2013 to over 9 Billion by 2050.  To sustain this rate of growth, we must provide as much food in the next 40 years as has been grown in the last 500 years.  From 1982 to 2007, over 41 Million acres of rural land was lost to development (the size of Illinois and New Jersey combined).  Approximately 23 Million acres of this was active agricultural land, and 14 Million acres was prime farmland.</p>
<p>At the same time that we need to grow more food on a shrinking available land base, we are also asking more and more of our farmers and ranchers.  We ask that they help reduce our nation’s dependency on fossil fuels by growing more bioenergy crops, that they provide adequate pollinator habitat (required for about 35% of our food supply), that they protect water quality, and that they incorporate management practices and technologies that optimize efficiencies of water and nutrient use.  In addition, while addressing these needs, producers are increasingly faced with extreme weather events, ranging from drought to flood.</p>
<p>Improving soil health allows us to simultaneously address these and other pressing natural resource needs.  Improving soil health allows us to improve water quality, increase soil water availability, enhance resilience to extreme weather, enhance nutrient cycling, increase carbon sequestration, provide wildlife habitat (including pollinators), enhance rural economic opportunity, and meet the food and fiber production needs of a rapidly growing population on a shrinking available land base.  Simply stated, improving the health of our Nation’s soils is one of the most important things we can do for this and for future generations.</p>
<p>USDA assists agricultural producers with improving soil health through increased knowledge and education that leads to development of science-based standards and specifications for management practices.  The research and educational activities conducted by USDA and its partners contribute much more than a body of knowledge. The information is used in standardized practices that when combined in a systems approach, form a customized plan for conserving selected resources.  Such conservation plans are applied by land managers to improve soil health.  In addition, the impact of implementing these standardized practices can be measured and modeled nationally, especially when combined with land, soil, climate, and other data.</p>
<p>The APG contributes to two of the four goals outlined in the USDA Strategic Plan.  Specifically, it contributes to meeting Goal 2: Ensure Our National Forests and Private Working Lands Are Conserved, Restored, and Made More Resilient to Climate Change, While Enhancing Our Water Resources; and Goal 1: Assist Rural Communities to Create Prosperity So They Are Self-Sustaining, Repopulating, and Economically Thriving.</p>
<p>Several USDA agencies will work cooperatively to achieve this APG.  Scientists from the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) will conduct and summarize research on the impacts of soil health promoting practices on available soil water holding capacity, soil carbon, water infiltration, nutrient availability and other important production system attributes.  Programs administered by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) will be used to provide competitive grants aimed at filling in the knowledge gaps (e.g. for specific soil properties or crop management systems).  Programs administered by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) will be used to demonstrate soil health management systems (e.g. through Conservation Innovation Grants and Plant Materials Centers) and provide financial/technical assistance to enhance adoption of soil health promoting practices (e.g. through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, EQIP).  This cooperation will allow each agency to contribute its own strengths to enhancing soil health across the public value chain from research to technology transfer to landowner adoption.  Existing partnerships with NGOs and foundations will be leveraged and broadened to amplify the impact of these investments.  These combined efforts to enhance the health of our Nation’s soils will allow USDA to help farmers and ranchers feed the world more profitably and sustainably – now and for generations to come.</p>
