            <!--<div class="teaser collapsed">
                                            </div>-->
            <div class="">
                <p>Smoking and second hand smoke is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States, killing more than an estimated 480,000 people in the U.S. each year.  For every smoker who dies from a smoking-attributable disease, another 30 live with a serious smoking-related disease.  Smoking costs the U.S. more than $300 billion a year, including nearly $170 billion in direct medical costs, and more than $156 billion in lost productivity.  An estimated 58 million nonsmoking Americans are exposed to secondhand smoke, which causes more than 41,000 deaths in non-smoking adults each year<a href="showcompare.html#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a>.  While cigarette smoking among adults has declined significantly over the past several decades, the use of other tobacco products has increased or stayed the same in recent years, concurrent with reductions in state investments in tobacco control program.  Fortunately, people who stop smoking greatly reduce their risk for disease and premature death. Smoking cessation lowers the risk for lung and other types of cancer; it reduces the risk for coronary heart disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease.  . </p>
<p>For FY15, the annual per capita adult cigarette consumption fell to 1,211 cigarette equivalents a 4% reduction from FY 14, but missing the target of 1,174 (37 cigarette equivalents).  However, the FY14 results (the most recent available data) of other combustible tobacco use indicators are tracking lower usage across both adults and youth:</p>
<ul><li>Percentage of adult smokers  - 16.8%; exceeding the FY14 target of 18% (National Health Interview Survey)</li>
<li>Percentage of adult smokers last smoked 6 months to 1 year ago – 7.6%; exceeding the FY14 target of 7.2% (National Health Interview Survey)</li>
<li>Percentage of children/adolescents initiation – 3.8%; exceeding the FY14 target of 4.7% (National Survey on Drug Use and Health)</li>
<li>Percentage of young adults initiation – 7.2%; exceeding the FY14 target of 7.5% (National Survey on Drug Use and Health)</li>
</ul><p>These significant trends with the continued plans of the Department to address combustible tobacco use make the FY16-FY17 combustible tobacco Agency Priority Goal highly achievable. </p>
<p>In 2010, HHS issued <em>Ending the Epidemic – A Tobacco Control Strategic Action Plan</em>, outlining a set of comprehensive actions framed around four key Healthy People 2020 tobacco control objectives:</p>
<ol><li>reduce tobacco use</li>
<li>reduce the initiation of tobacco use</li>
<li>increase successful cessation attempts by smokers</li>
<li>reduce the proportion of nonsmokers exposed to secondhand smoke.</li>
</ol><p>The National Prevention Strategy, released in 2011, includes tobacco control as one of seven priorities across the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>In 2013, cigarette and smokeless tobacco companies spent more than $9.5 billion, more than $1 million per hour that year, on advertising and promotional expenses in the United States to attract new users, retain current users, increase consumption, and generate favorable attitudes toward smoking.  There is also a growing concern regarding new tobacco products that are being marketed to smokers as alternatives for use in smoke-free environments.  Dual use of cigarettes and other tobacco products can maintain tobacco addiction and use among smokers who might otherwise quit.  The marketing of purported reduced-risk products may increase overall tobacco use. Consumer mistaken perceptions of the “safety” of these products may pose a continuing obstacle for tobacco control.</p>
<p>States continue to reduce funding for comprehensive tobacco control. Research has shown that progress to prevent initiation and promote cessation in comprehensive programs is reversed when funding is no longer sustained. </p>
<p>HHS engages with multiple stakeholders in implementing tobacco control activities, which include: Congress, the public, minority communities, groups affected by tobacco-related health disparities, state and local tobacco control officials, tobacco control and public health non-governmental organizations, the scientific &amp; research community, and businesses.</p>
<p>The U.S. Congress has provided direction and support for tobacco control activities in the following legislative actions:</p>
<ul><li>The <em>Patient Protection and</em> <em>Affordable Care Act</em></li>
<li>The <em>American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA)</em></li>
<li>The <em>Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (FSPTCA)</em></li>
<li>The <em>Children’s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act</em> (<em>CHIPRA</em>)</li>
</ul><p>HHS oversees tobacco control and prevention committees covered by the Federal Advisory Committee Act. All meetings of these committees are open to the public and offer opportunities for stakeholder feedback.</p>

            <h2>Strategies</h2>
            <!--<div class="teaser collapsed">

            <div class="">
                <p>The Department’s comprehensive tobacco control strategy, Ending the Epidemic – A Tobacco Control Strategic Action Plan, is designed to mobilize HHS’s expertise and resources in support of proven, pragmatic, achievable actions that can be aggressively implemented at the federal, state, and community levels. OASH has created a Tobacco Control Steering Committee chaired by the Office of the Surgeon General (OSG), CDC, FDA, and NIH with participation from the HHS agencies integral to tobacco control (CMS, SAMHSA, and HRSA).  The committee under the direct leadership of the US Surgeon General will coordinate the Department’s efforts to achieve the Agency Priority Goal.</p>
<p>The key components of HHS’s tobacco control program to achieve the Agency Priority Goal are:<br />
• Increase successful cessation attempts by smokers<br />
• Reduce initiation of smoking use among adolescents and young adults</p>
<p>These strategies are aligned both with the Healthy People 2020 objectives as well as the HHS Tobacco Control Strategic Plan.  Each is a cornerstone of comprehensive tobacco control with planned activities based on an extensive evidence base.  A number of authoritative scientific publications have identified effective interventions that when fully implemented, will dramatically reduce tobacco use.  A comprehensive program, that combines educational, clinical, regulatory, economic and social strategies, has shown to reduce cigarette consumption, smoking rates, and tobacco-related death and disease. States and locales that have made significant investments in comprehensive tobacco control programs have seen cigarette consumption drop more than twice as much as in the entire United States.   As an example of a state that has made significant investments in comprehensive tobacco control, since 1988, the California per capita cigarette consumption declined by 59.0 percent. During the same period, per capita cigarette consumption in the rest of the nation declined by 35.0 percent.</p>

            <h2>Progress Update</h2>
            <div>
                <p>The Department continues to direct and monitor tobacco control milestones that will help achieve this goal.  The Department is currently on track in accomplishing its projected Agency Priority Goal.   </p>
<p><u>Accomplishments from FY16Q4:</u></p>
<p>• OASH/OSG</p>
<ul><li>As of October 2016, the Tobacco-Free College Campus Initiative (TFCCI):</li>
<li> 1,483 smoke-free campuses, of which 1,137 were fully tobacco-free</li>
<li>823 campuses now prohibit the use of e-cigarettes anywhere on campus</li>
<li>Since November 2015 - 90 campuses have participated in the 1DayStand, which invites people who smoke to give up the habit for a day and raises awareness about the role tobacco-free campuses play in reducing tobacco use and exposure to second hand smoke.</li>
</ul><p>• CDC</p>
<ul><li>CDC launched the first ever nationwide Tips from Former Smokers radio promotion offering free nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) to eligible 1-800-QUIT-NOW callers. The 2016 promotion consisted of two Tips radio ads tagged with an offer of free NRT and aired for two weeks from June 20th to July 1st, one week after the 2016 Tips TV ads ended</li>
<li>Released key findings on disparities in cigarette smoking, secondhand smoke exposure in multiunit housing, and attitudes toward tobacco sales in pharmacies reaching an audience of more than 322 million and an ad value of $353,000</li>
</ul><p>• FDA</p>
<ul><li>Since the start of FY16:
<ul><li>Conducted more than 150,000 retail inspections</li>
<li>Issued more than 13,000 warning letters</li>
<li>Assessed more than 3,000 civil money penalties</li>
<li>Completed more than 45 facility inspections of tobacco product manufacturers. </li>
<li>Filed 20 No-Tobacco-Sale Order (NTSO) complaints.  Under the law, the FDA may pursue an NTSO against retailers that have a total of five or more repeated violations of those restrictions during compliance</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Began including newly deemed products in retail inspections, resulting in the first warning letters being issued to 55 tobacco retailers —including major national retail chains, tobacco specialty stores, and online retailers—for selling newly-regulated tobacco products, such as e-cigarettes, e-liquids, and cigars to minors</li>
<li>Began surveillance of websites that sell regulated ENDS products and took enforcement actions when violations were found</li>
<li>Launched new advertising for The Real Cost: Smokeless Tobacco campaign targeting rural males ages 12-17 at risk of smokeless tobacco use</li>
<li>Launched This Free Life, a new tobacco prevention campaign targeting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender young adults ages 18-24 who smoke occasionally</li>
<li>Expanded the Fresh Empire campaign, designed for at-risk multicultural youth ages 12–17 who identify with Hip Hop culture, to 36 designated market areas</li>
<li>Completed data collection for the third wave of The Real Cost campaign outcome evaluation, baseline data collection for The Real Cost: Smokeless Tobacco campaign, and baseline data collection for This Free Life campaign</li>
<li>Conducted formative research on draft creative concepts for a future Point-of-Sale campaign</li>
</ul><p>• NIH/National Cancer Institute (NCI)</p>
<ul><li>In collaboration with FDA, continued development of mHealth resources targeting ambivalent smokers, including the development and pilot testing of two new text-based programs</li>
<li>Completed the development of a prototype of natural language (e.g., Chat Bot) mHealth cessation resource</li>
<li>Continued expansion of functionality to improve personalization of user experience within behavioral intervention mHealth resources, including text and smartphone app interventions, to improve engagement and effectiveness. This included implantation of time and geolocation tagging capabilities.  </li>
<li>Continued expansion of resources designed to reach and engage identified priority vulnerable populations, including cancer survivors, women who smoke while pregnant, LGBT, Spanish-language smokers, and smokers with comorbid depressive disorders.</li>
</ul><p>
In 2013, cigarette and smokeless tobacco companies spent more than $9.5 billion, or more than $1 million per hour that year, on advertising and promotional expenses in the United States to attract new users, retain current users, increase consumption, and generate favorable attitudes toward smoking and tobacco use. <br />
The use of E-Cigarettes and hookah among youth continues to rise.</p>

                <h2>Contributing Programs & Other Factors</h2>
                <div>
                    <p><strong><u>The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, HHS (OASH)</u></strong> OASH coordinates all tobacco control activities for the Department and has lead responsibility for accomplishment of this goal. The Assistant Secretary for Health directed the development of the HHS Strategic Plan on Tobacco Control. The Surgeon General chairs the HHS Tobacco Control Implementation Committee, and is the APG Goal Leader.</p>
<p><strong><u>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) </u></strong>CDC’s Center for Chronic Disease and Public Health Promotion, through the Office on Smoking and Health, provides national leadership for a comprehensive, broad-based approach to reducing tobacco use. Essential elements of this approach include state-based, community-based, and health system-based interventions; cessation services; counter-marketing; policy development and implementation; tobacco product research; surveillance; and evaluation.</p>
<p><strong><u>The Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Tobacco Products (CTP)</u></strong>  FDA is responsible for implementing the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control Act), which gives the agency authority to regulate the manufacture, marketing, and distribution of tobacco products as provided by statute and as appropriate for the protection of public health. Some of the agency’s responsibilities under the law include setting tobacco product standards, reviewing premarket applications for new and modified-risk tobacco products, requiring new health warnings, and estab­lishing and enforcing advertising and promotion restrictions.</p>
<p><strong><u>The National Institute of Health’s Tobacco Control Research Branch (TCRB)</u></strong> NIH has identified research to prevent and control tobacco use and tobacco-related cancers as a public health priority. The Tobacco Control Research Branch (TCRB) in the National Cancer Institute leads and collaborates on research and disseminates evidence-based findings to prevent, treat, and control tobacco use. Branch activities include funding research grants and contracts, sponsoring conferences and symposia, and disseminating tobacco control science. Additionally, experts conduct research and partici­pate in diverse scientific and programmatic activities in support of national and international tobacco control efforts.  TCRB smoking cessation and mobile health experts also lead the Smokefree.gov Initiative (SFGI). SFGI provides interventions for smoking and related health behaviors across web, text, smartphone app and social media platforms.</p>
<p><strong><u>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)</u></strong> CMS provides coverage of smoking and tobacco cessation counseling for certain beneficiaries. Through Medicare, all beneficiaries who use tobacco are covered.  Tobacco cessation counseling and likewise the provision of tobacco cessation pharmaceuticals are optional benefits under Medicaid for all individuals should the state elect to provide them. As of 10/1/10, Medicaid requires states to provide those services to pregnant women.</p>
<p><strong><u>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)</u></strong> SAMHSA supports a variety of tobacco prevention and treatment activities.  This includes collaborating with states and behavioral health providers to address the high prevalence of tobacco use by persons with mental and substance use disorders.  In addition, SAMHSA is responsible for implementing the Synar Amendment, which requires states to have laws prohibiting the sale and distribution of tobacco products to minors, enforce those laws, and report on retail non-compliance. </p>
<p><strong><u>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) </u></strong>HRSA’s Health Center Program addresses tobacco use through education, counseling and treatment, aligning with the Healthy People 2020 framework for ending the tobacco use epidemic by supporting tobacco use prevention efforts and helping tobacco users quit.  The Health Center Program monitors these efforts by tracking the percentage of patients who are screened for tobacco use and provided appropriate cessation counseling or medication if needed. </p>
<p><strong><u>The Indian Health Service (IHS)</u></strong> The IHS Cancer Program seeks to reduce tobacco use by promoting clinic based cessation efforts, encouraging community-based education and policy interventions, and providing technical assistance to existing surveillance efforts for Indian Health Service, Tribal health, and urban Indian health programs.</p>

                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Statement:</span><p>To reduce the national rate of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) by September 30, 2015 by demonstrating a 10% reduction in national hospital-acquired catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) from the current SIR of 1.03 to a target SIR of 0.92.</p>
</p>
                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>At any given time, about one in every 25 hospitalized patients has a healthcare-associated infection while over 1 million HAIs occur across the U.S. healthcare system every year. These infections can lead to significant morbidity and mortality, with tens of thousands of lives lost each year.</p>
<p>Of these hospital-acquired events, catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) are among the most common. Research has shown that a significant portion of these infections can be prevented, avoiding patient morbidity and mortality from this HAI while reducing costs accrued to the healthcare system.</p>
<p>The HAI Agency Priority Goal is to reduce the national rate of HAI by demonstrating significant, quantitative and measurable reductions in hospital-acquired CAUTI. As such; the FY2014-15 HAI Agency Priority Goal (APG) is to reduce the national CAUTI standardized infection ratio by 10% by September 2015 over the current 2012 baseline of 1.03. Of note, this SIR baseline was changed from 1.02 to 1.03 in this goal. This reflects the fact that the CDC released preliminary final numbers for 2012 in September 2013, the time at which this goal was written. However, hospitals still had through the end of the year to report final data to NHSN. Accounting for the last three months of data submitted by some hospitals caused a slight adjustment in the final (and thus baseline) 2012 SIR from 1.02 to 1.03. We make this adjustment in the HAI.APG to reflect the finalized SIR and to maintain consistency with other HAI reports moving forward.</p>
<p>As we carry this portion of the goal from the FY2011-13 goal, a concerted effort between the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Office of the Assistant Secretary of Health (OASH) will continue to be a crucial to meeting goal targets. The main US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) operating divisions that constitute this workgroup will focus on applying their HAI programmatic efforts in a way that aligns strategy and metrics, provides consistent messaging to its audience, uses data to target those facilities in most need of improvement, and creates synergy to achieve CAUTI reduction outcomes.</p>
<p>We will continue to use combined HHS programmatic levers to contribute to the achievement of CAUTI targets. These initiatives include:</p>
<ul><li>Quality Improvement Organization (QIOs) Program</li>
<li>Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting (HIQR) Program</li>
<li>Disseminating Data for Action using the  National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN)</li>
<li>State HAI programs</li>
<li>Partnership for Patients (PfP)</li>
<li>Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program (CUSP) for CAUTI Ongoing coordination through HAI strategic planning, HAI Regional and National Meetings</li>
<li>Regular review and updates to the National Action Plan to prevent HAIs: "Roadmap to Elimination."</li>
</ul><p>Attention to several factors are necessary to assess progress toward goals in this new period. As in the previous HAI goal and consistent with a measurement strategy used by a majority of hospitals that participate in national HAI reporting initiatives, this goal will use the standardized infection ratio (SIR) as the measure, NHSN, the CDC-run infection surveillance system as the primary data source and report data points on  a biannual basis. A six month lag in data will remain in order to ensure the most complete and accurate data being reported out and minimize statistically insignificant variations in the data.</p>
<p>Lessons learned from the previous goal allow us to predict potential changes in the CAUTI SIR trend in the months following January 2015 now that CMS' Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting (HIQR)  program requires participating hospitals to report CAUTI in non-intensive care units to receive their full annual payment update. The influx of new CAUTI reporters in the middle of the previous 2011-13 HAI.APG was identified as one but not the sole, etiology behind an increase in the CAUTI SIR over the life of this goal. The differences in CAUTI SIRs in ICU and non-ICU settings along with the influx of new reporters among non-ICU locations in 2015 may impact this goal. The degree to which this could again be a factor again is unknown especially since through programmatic outreach, many hospitals already report non-ICU CAUTI data to NHSN voluntarily.</p>
<p>We also anticipate application of the new CAUTI definition, which went into effect January 1, 2015, to the APG data we will report in subsequent quarters. Because our baseline CAUTI SIR was calculated using the old CAUTI definition, a strategy to ensure continuity and validity of new SIR data across this goal has been established. The CDC will construct a new SIR by applying the new CAUTI definition to our current baseline SIR and data points proceeding January 1, 2015. In other words, we will translate SIR data including our baseline data prior to January 1st to SIR data that is reflective of the changes in the CAUTI definition. We will also be able to illustrate the CAUTI SIR baseline and trending data by applying the new vs the old definition in order to demonstrate the degree of difference or lack thereof resulting from this definitional change. CDC has changed the CAUTI definition in response to input from stakeholders and scientific data.The HAI Workgroup will present full details on the definition change in relation to this goal and our targeted CAUTI SIR reductions to HHS leadership in November of 2015.</p>
<p>Lastly, analysis of the CAUTI data continues to reveal marked difference in reductions between intensive care and non-intensive care units. Intensive care units have significantly higher SIRs, higher number of catheter-days, and show less reductions in these indicators of progress than in the non ICU setting. The difference in CAUTI reductions between ICUs and non-ICU settings have been highlighted in analysis of both NHSN and CUSP for CAUTI data. Given the fact that sicker patients are admitted in ICUs, retaining a urinary catheter for  longer may be a rooted in practice necessity or  provider belief that it is a necessity and so concentrating on behavioral and systems process change may need to be further emphasized as we  work in this setting to reduce CAUTI. The 10% goal for CAUTI reduction in this APG effort represents a composite goal that reflects greater reductions in non-ICU settings and lesser reductions in ICUs. Improvements in CAUTI however, have been demonstrated in large scale improvement programs when actively engaged in embedding evidence-based infection control protocol and a culture of safety unit and facility-wide. It’s also important to note that preliminary projections through the first three quarters of 2015 continue to show a fall in the CAUTI SIR and an on-track trajectory for achieving the CAUTI goal target.</p>

Smoking cessation lowers the risk for lung and other types of cancer; it reduces the risk for coronary heart disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease.  . </p>
<p>In 2010, HHS issued Ending the Epidemic – A Tobacco Control Strategic Action Plan, outlining a set of comprehensive actions framed around four key Healthy People 2020 tobacco control objectives:<br />
1) reduce tobacco use<br />
2) reduce the initiation of tobacco use<br />
3) increase successful cessation attempts by smokers<br />
4) reduce the proportion of nonsmokers exposed to secondhand smoke.</p>
<p>The National Prevention Strategy, released in 2011, includes tobacco control as one of seven priorities across the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>In 2012, cigarette and smokeless tobacco companies spent more than $9.6 billion, more than $1 million per hour that year, on advertising and promotional expenses in the United States to attract new users, retain current users, increase consumption, and generate favorable attitudes toward smoking.  There is also a growing concern regarding new tobacco products that are being marketed to smokers as alternatives for use in smoke-free environments.  Dual use of cigarettes and other tobacco products can maintain tobacco addiction and use among smokers who might otherwise quit.  The marketing of purported reduced-risk products may increase overall tobacco use. Consumer mistaken perceptions of the “safety” of these products may pose a continuing obstacle for tobacco control.</p>
<p>States continue to reduce funding for comprehensive tobacco control. Research has shown that progress to prevent initiation and promote cessation in comprehensive programs is reversed when funding is no longer sustained. </p>
<p>HHS engages with multiple stakeholders in implementing tobacco control activities, which include: Congress, the public, minority communities, groups affected by tobacco-related health disparities, state and local tobacco control officials, tobacco control and public health non-governmental organizations, the scientific &amp; research community, and businesses.</p>
<p>The U.S. Congress has provided direction and support for tobacco control activities in the following legislative actions:<br />
• The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act<br />
• The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA)<br />
• The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (FSPTCA)<br />
• The Children’s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA)</p>
<p>HHS oversees tobacco control and prevention committees covered by the Federal Advisory Committee Act. All meetings of these committees are open to the public and offer opportunities for stakeholder feedback.</p>

                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Statement:</span><p>To reduce the national rate of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) by September 30, 2015 by demonstrating a 10% reduction in national hospital-acquired catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) from the current SIR of 1.03 to a target SIR of 0.92.</p>
</p>
                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>At any given time, about one in every 25 hospitalized patients has a healthcare-associated infection while over 1 million HAIs occur across the U.S. healthcare system every year. These infections can lead to significant morbidity and mortality, with tens of thousands of lives lost each year.</p>
<p>Of these hospital-acquired events, catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) are among the most common. Research has shown that a significant portion of these infections can be prevented, avoiding patient morbidity and mortality from this HAI while reducing costs accrued to the healthcare system.</p>
<p>The HAI Agency Priority Goal is to reduce the national rate of HAI by demonstrating significant, quantitative and measurable reductions in hospital-acquired CAUTI. As such; the FY2014-15 HAI Agency Priority Goal (APG) is to reduce the national CAUTI standardized infection ratio by 10% by September 2015 over the current 2012 baseline of 1.03. Of note, this SIR baseline was changed from 1.02 to 1.03 in this goal. This reflects the fact that the CDC released preliminary final numbers for 2012 in September 2013, the time at which this goal was written. However, hospitals still had through the end of the year to report final data to NHSN. Accounting for the last three months of data submitted by some hospitals caused a slight adjustment in the final (and thus baseline) 2012 SIR from 1.02 to 1.03. We make this adjustment in the HAI.APG to reflect the finalized SIR and to maintain consistency with other HAI reports moving forward.</p>
<p>As we carry this portion of the goal from the FY2011-13 goal, a concerted effort between the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Office of the Assistant Secretary of Health (OASH) will continue to be a crucial to meeting goal targets. The main US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) operating divisions that constitute this workgroup will focus on applying their HAI programmatic efforts in a way that aligns strategy and metrics, provides consistent messaging to its audience, uses data to target those facilities in most need of improvement, and creates synergy to achieve CAUTI reduction outcomes.</p>
<p>We will continue to use combined HHS programmatic levers to contribute to the achievement of CAUTI targets. These initiatives include:</p>
<ul><li>Quality Improvement Organization (QIOs) Program</li>
<li>Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting (HIQR) Program</li>
<li>Disseminating Data for Action using the  National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN)</li>
<li>State HAI programs</li>
<li>Partnership for Patients (PfP)</li>
<li>Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program (CUSP) for CAUTI Ongoing coordination through HAI strategic planning, HAI Regional and National Meetings</li>
<li>Regular review and updates to the National Action Plan to prevent HAIs: "Roadmap to Elimination."</li>
</ul><p>Attention to several factors are necessary to assess progress toward goals in this new period. As in the previous HAI goal and consistent with a measurement strategy used by a majority of hospitals that participate in national HAI reporting initiatives, this goal will use the standardized infection ratio (SIR) as the measure, NHSN, the CDC-run infection surveillance system as the primary data source and report data points on  a biannual basis. A six month lag in data will remain in order to ensure the most complete and accurate data being reported out and minimize statistically insignificant variations in the data.</p>
<p>Lessons learned from the previous goal allow us to predict potential changes in the CAUTI SIR trend in the months following January 2015 now that CMS' Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting (HIQR)  program requires participating hospitals to report CAUTI in non-intensive care units to receive their full annual payment update. The influx of new CAUTI reporters in the middle of the previous 2011-13 HAI.APG was identified as one but not the sole, etiology behind an increase in the CAUTI SIR over the life of this goal. The differences in CAUTI SIRs in ICU and non-ICU settings along with the influx of new reporters among non-ICU locations in 2015 may impact this goal. The degree to which this could again be a factor again is unknown especially since through programmatic outreach, many hospitals already report non-ICU CAUTI data to NHSN voluntarily.</p>
<p>We also anticipate application of the new CAUTI definition, which went into effect January 1, 2015, to the APG data we will report in subsequent quarters. Because our baseline CAUTI SIR was calculated using the old CAUTI definition, a strategy to ensure continuity and validity of new SIR data across this goal has been established. The CDC will construct a new SIR by applying the new CAUTI definition to our current baseline SIR and data points proceeding January 1, 2015. In other words, we will translate SIR data including our baseline data prior to January 1st to SIR data that is reflective of the changes in the CAUTI definition. We will also be able to illustrate the CAUTI SIR baseline and trending data by applying the new vs the old definition in order to demonstrate the degree of difference or lack thereof resulting from this definitional change. CDC has changed the CAUTI definition in response to input from stakeholders and scientific data.The HAI Workgroup will present full details on the definition change in relation to this goal and our targeted CAUTI SIR reductions to HHS leadership in November of 2015.</p>
<p>Lastly, analysis of the CAUTI data continues to reveal marked difference in reductions between intensive care and non-intensive care units. Intensive care units have significantly higher SIRs, higher number of catheter-days, and show less reductions in these indicators of progress than in the non ICU setting. The difference in CAUTI reductions between ICUs and non-ICU settings have been highlighted in analysis of both NHSN and CUSP for CAUTI data. Given the fact that sicker patients are admitted in ICUs, retaining a urinary catheter for  longer may be a rooted in practice necessity or  provider belief that it is a necessity and so concentrating on behavioral and systems process change may need to be further emphasized as we  work in this setting to reduce CAUTI. The 10% goal for CAUTI reduction in this APG effort represents a composite goal that reflects greater reductions in non-ICU settings and lesser reductions in ICUs. Improvements in CAUTI however, have been demonstrated in large scale improvement programs when actively engaged in embedding evidence-based infection control protocol and a culture of safety unit and facility-wide. It’s also important to note that preliminary projections through the first three quarters of 2015 continue to show a fall in the CAUTI SIR and an on-track trajectory for achieving the CAUTI goal target.</p>

</p>
                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>This Priority Goal calls for actions in FY 2014 and FY 2015 to improve the quality of early childhood education programs for low-income children.  For the ACF Child Care program, the goal is to increase the number of states with Quality Rating and Improvement Systems (QRIS) that meet the seven high quality benchmarks for child care and other early childhood programs, developed by HHS.  QRIS is a mechanism by which to improve the quality of child care available in communities and increase parents’ knowledge and understanding of the child care options available to them.  In order for a QRIS to be considered as meeting high-quality benchmarks, it must 1) be statewide; 2) be eligible to child care centers and family child care homes; 3) include quality improvement indicators that cover learning environments and curriculum, teacher/practitioner standards, and family partnerships and strengthening; 4) use training or on-site consultation to help child care programs attain or maintain quality improvement standards beyond licensing; 5) offer financial incentives for maintaining or increasing quality to child care centers and family child care homes; 6) include quality assessments of child care centers and family child care homes; and 7) use symbols or simple icons that indicate levels of quality as part of resource and referral/consumer education services to parents seeking child care.  For FY 2011, a baseline of 17 states had implemented a QRIS that met all outlined high quality benchmarks.  The baseline was calculated using FY 2012-2013 State Plans that were submitted in September 2011.  In FY 2014, 29 states had a QRIS that met high quality benchmarks, meeting the previously established target.  States expanded from pilot programs to statewide-systems and increased availability to quality information, leading them to meet more components of the QRIS measure. States were also supported by targeted technical assistance through state specific benchmarks and goals.  The FY 2014 results show that states continue to make progress toward implementing QRIS that meet high-quality benchmarks, and the ACF Office of Child Care (OCC) has established a target of 32 states for FY 2015.</p>
<p>Currently, many states meet some, but not all seven, of the outlined benchmarks. States are making significant progress toward implementing a comprehensive QRIS that meets all outlined quality benchmarks; however, their progress is masked by the single figure reported. To provide a more complete picture of QRIS implementation and improvements across the country, OCC is closely tracking the progress of states that may not meet <em>all</em> quality benchmarks, but that have demonstrated improvements by increasing the number of benchmarks reached.  For example, as of FY 2014, at least six states have incorporated six quality benchmarks and at least six states have incorporated five quality benchmarks.  Between FY 2011 and FY 2014, 27 states and territories have made progress on at least one of the components of the measure.  In addition, targeted technical assistance provided by the new National Center on Early Childhood Quality Assurance, as well as other technical assistance partners funded by ACF, will continue to help states work toward their goal of improving their QRIS.</p>
<p>Also as part of this Priority Goal, the ACF Office of Head Start (OHS) is striving to increase the percentage of Head Start children in high quality classrooms. Progress is measured by reducing the proportion of Head Start grantees scoring in the low range in any domain of the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS: Pre-K). This research-based tool measures teacher-child interaction on a seven-point scale in three broad domains: Emotional Support, Classroom Organization, and Instructional Support.   OHS successfully began data collection using random samples for the CLASS: Pre-K in the first quarter of FY 2012.  Analysis of the full data set of CLASS scores for the cohort of 388 Head Start grantees that received on-site monitoring in the 2011-2012 Head Start “school year” occurred in October of 2012, and OHS established a baseline of 25 percent scoring in the low range.</p>
<p>An analysis of CLASS scores for the most recent cohort of 404 Head Start grantees that received on-site monitoring in the 2013-2014 Head Start “school year” (FY 2014 actual result) indicates that 23 percent of grantees scored in the low range, thus meeting the target of 27 percent.  All grantees scoring in the low range (below 2.5) in FY 2014 did so for the Instructional Support domain.  (Nationwide for the CLASS: Pre-K tool, scores are typically higher in the domains of Emotional Support and Classroom Organization than in the domain of Instructional Support.)</p>
<p>The FY 2014 result is a signicant improvement relative to the previous FY 2013 result, when the number of grantees scoring below a 2.5 was 31 percent.  In response to the data from the FY 2013 CLASS reviews, OHS developed a system to provide more intentional targeted assistance to those grantees that score in the low range on CLASS.  OHS is continuing to flag grantees that score in the low range, conduct more analyses on the specific dimension level, which are specific elements or skill areas within each of the three domains, and providing periodic reports to its Regional Offices so they can direct their TTA to specific grantees.  For example, concept development, quality of feedback, and language modeling are the three dimensions within the domain of Instructional Support.  Providing TTA at the more specific dimension-level supports grantees to focus in on the skills that need improvement.</p>
<p>There are some challenges to making progress in these areas.  In the past two decades, a growing body of evidence has established the importance of quality child care in promoting healthy child development and school readiness and success for children.  However, systemic changes take time to implement, and states are at different starting points.  In the FY 2016 Budget request to Congress, the President continued to build a continuum of high-quality early childhood programs, including proposing an historic investment of $82 billion over 10 years to increase the availability of high-quality child care for children under four years old.  On November 19, 2014, the President signed into the law the first statutory reauthorization of the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) program since 1996, which aims to move children receiving subsidies into high-quality child care settings.  Among a comprehensive array of reforms, the new statute includes an increased focus on improving the quality of child care through systemic quality investments, which will help move states toward meeting this priority performance goal. In addition, the statute includes provisions requiring states to evaluate the measurable outcomes of their quality improvement activities. OCC is gathering information about QRIS implementation through the CCDBG Plan and the annual quality performance report, as well as providing states with targeted technical assistance through state specific technical assistance plans and goals.  ACF recently announced the Early Childhood Training and Technical Assistance System, which transforms the current TA system for child care, T/TA for Head Start, and related programs into a coordinated system that will provide training, resources and materials to multiple stakeholder groups at regional, state and local levels to support school readiness.  The new National Center on Early Childhood Quality Assurance will help OCC continue to support the infrastructure of an early childhood education quality improvement framework, including QRIS.        </p>
<p>Additionally, with respect to Head Start, there are 50,000 Head Start and Early Head Start classrooms across the country in diverse settings ranging from New York City to the bottom of the Grand Canyon.  Changing teacher behavior and practices at the ground level to improve the quality of the classroom is a formidable challenge, particularly in highly rural areas, American Indian and Alaska Native programs, and Migrant and Seasonal Head Start programs where finding qualified staff can be difficult due to more limited access to higher education.  OHS is using multiple approaches to address this challenge, including policy levers, training and technical assistance, and professional development efforts.</p>

<p>In 2010, HHS issued Ending the Epidemic – A Tobacco Control Strategic Action Plan, outlining a set of comprehensive actions framed around four key Healthy People 2020 tobacco control objectives:<br />
1) reduce tobacco use<br />
2) reduce the initiation of tobacco use<br />
3) increase successful cessation attempts by smokers<br />
4) reduce the proportion of nonsmokers exposed to secondhand smoke.</p>
<p>The National Prevention Strategy, released in 2011, includes tobacco control as one of seven priorities across the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>In 2012, cigarette and smokeless tobacco companies spent more than $9.6 billion, more than $1 million per hour that year, on advertising and promotional expenses in the United States to attract new users, retain current users, increase consumption, and generate favorable attitudes toward smoking.  There is also a growing concern regarding new tobacco products that are being marketed to smokers as alternatives for use in smoke-free environments.  Dual use of cigarettes and other tobacco products can maintain tobacco addiction and use among smokers who might otherwise quit.  The marketing of purported reduced-risk products may increase overall tobacco use. Consumer mistaken perceptions of the “safety” of these products may pose a continuing obstacle for tobacco control.</p>
<p>States continue to reduce funding for comprehensive tobacco control. Research has shown that progress to prevent initiation and promote cessation in comprehensive programs is reversed when funding is no longer sustained. </p>
<p>HHS engages with multiple stakeholders in implementing tobacco control activities, which include: Congress, the public, minority communities, groups affected by tobacco-related health disparities, state and local tobacco control officials, tobacco control and public health non-governmental organizations, the scientific &amp; research community, and businesses.</p>

</p>
                            <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p><em>Salmonella is the leading known cause of bacterial foodborne illness and death in the United States. Each year in the United States, Salmonella causes an estimated 1.2 million illnesses, including fever and diarrhea, and between 400 and 500 deaths. Salmonella serotype Enteritidis (SE), a subtype of Salmonella, is now the most common type of Salmonella in the United States and accounts for approximately 20% of all Salmonella cases in humans. The most significant sources of foodborne SE infections are shell eggs (FDA-regulated) and broiler chickens (USDA-regulated). Therefore, reducing SE illness from shell eggs is the most appropriate FDA strategy for reducing illness from SE. Preventing Salmonella infections depends on actions taken by regulatory agencies, the food industry and consumers to reduce contamination of food, as well as actions taken for detecting and responding to outbreaks. As part of the shared vision to reduce foodborne illness, HHS's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has developed a Priority Goal to reduce Salmonella contamination in shell eggs, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is working with FDA to gather more data to better estimate sources of illness. Additionally, USDA, FDA and CDC are involved in many interagency efforts, including the Interagency Food Safety Analytics Collaboration (IFSAC). This interagency collaboration is working to improve methods used to estimate the proportion of foodborne illnesses associated with specific sources.</em></p>
