                        <p>The Department accomplishes its mission through direct assistance to businesses and communities, targeted investment in world-class research, science, technology, and more. The Secretary of Commerce leads the Department and its 12 bureaus with a budget of about $8.0 billion and nearly 47,000 employees worldwide.</p>
<p>The Department of Commerce helps American businesses drive economic growth and job creation in a number of critical areas:</p>
<ul><li>Critical programs at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) support innovation and cutting-edge manufacturers which in turn create good-paying jobs.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Through protecting the intellectual property that sustains innovation, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) contributes directly to strengthening America’s leadership in manufacturing. USPTO is currently implementing patent reform legislation that will help modernize the U.S. patent system.</li>
<li>The Economic Development Administration (EDA) invests in competitive, job-creating, advanced manufacturing projects and regional innovation clusters.</li>
<li>The Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) supports the competitiveness of minority-owned firms.</li>
<li>By connecting U.S. businesses with opportunities abroad, the International Trade Administration (ITA) advances the goals of the National Export Initiative, works to remove trade barriers and promotes new business investment in the United States from foreign and domestic companies.</li>
<li>The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) improves our economic security through efforts to reform our outdated export control laws.</li>
<li>Critical to our competitiveness, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) expands broadband Internet access and ensures the Internet remains an engine for innovation and economic growth.</li>
<li>The Economics and Statistics Administration (ESA), including the Census Bureau and Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), provide the economic and demographic data to evaluate growth, understand markets, and help American businesses make decisions for the future.</li>
<li>By providing data that supports marine commerce, sustainable use of ocean resources, and accurate weather and climate forecasting, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) supports sustainable communities and economies.</li>
</ul><p>The Department issued an updated five-year strategic plan in June 2011 which outlines its strategic goals and objectives as well as the programs, strategies, and metrics used to achieve them and track their attainment.  The strategic plan is implemented through annual performance plans, which are integral elements of the Department's annual budget proposals.  Progress is documented through annual Performance and Accountability Reports.  The Department has also identified a limited number of priority goals that are a particular focus over the near-term.  Priority goals for FY 2012-2013 are outlined in a February 2012 addendum to the strategic plan (Appendix B).</p>

<div class="intro_text">
<p>Established by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goals are a tool used to accelerate progress on a limited number of priority areas where implementation requires active collaboration between multiple agencies, overcoming organizational barriers to achieve better performance than one agency can achieve on its own.</p>
<p>Set or revised at least every four years, CAP Goals include outcome-oriented goals that cover a limited number of crosscutting policy areas as well as management goals focused on management improvements across the Federal Government in areas of financial management, strategic human capital management, information technology management, procurement and acquisition management, and real property management.</p>
<p>A series of 16 CAP Goals were announced in the 2015 Budget with clearly named accountable officials, data-driven reviews that incorporated a broad range of quantitative and qualitative inputs, and reporting to the public through a common website as a framework to drive performance improvements on cross-government collaboration and tackle government-wide management challenges affecting most agencies.</p>

<p>On June 30, 2016, the President signed into law the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 – nearly 50 years after President Johnson signed the original FOIA into law.  This critical legislation reflects the progress made by the Administration, codifies a number of openness and transparency principles, and ensures that the Administration’s track record of openness is institutionalized throughout government and carries forward for years to come.  Concurrent with the signing of the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, the White House released a Fact Sheet committing the Administration to:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Utilizing the Chief FOIA Officers Council and FOIA Advisory Committee to address FOIA’s greatest challenges;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promoting broader release of records through a “release to one is a release to all” presumption;</p>

<li>
<p>Launching a centralized FOIA request portal; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Issuing new guidance on open government principles and actions.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The Administration also announced the creation of a FOIA Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goal as a framework for tracking progress on the Administration’s commitments and key requirements of the Act.  Under the cross-agency leadership of the Department of Justice, National Archives and Records Administration, and Office of Management and Budget, the Administration remains committed to assisting agencies in their efforts to improve implementation of the FOIA and leveraging technology to achieve a new era of open government.  </p>

    Efficiency: Maximize value of Federal spending  </h3>

</div>  </div>  
  <div class="views-field views-field-field-cag-overview-revision-id">    <span class="views-label views-label-field-cag-overview-revision-id">Overview: </span>    <div class="field-content"><p>On March 19, 2015, the President issued Executive Order 13693, <em>Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade</em>, which set forth ambitious climate, energy, and environmental sustainability goals for Federal agencies over the next decade.  Executive departments and agencies have been among our Nation’s leaders as the United States works to build a clean energy economy that will sustain our prosperity and the health of our people and our environment for generations to come. Federal leadership in energy, environmental water, transportation fleets, buildings, and acquisition management will continue to drive national greenhouse gas reductions and support preparations for the impacts of climate change. The Federal Government has the opportunity to significantly reduce direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2025, while at the same time fostering innovation, reducing spending, and strengthening the communities in which our Federal facilities operate. </p>
<p>Employing this strategy for the next decade calls for expanded and updated Federal environmental performance goals with a clear overarching objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions across Federal operations and the Federal supply chain.  Goals for greenhouse gas emissions reduction (40% by 2025), renewable electricity (30% by 2025), clean energy (25% by 2025), and performance contracting ($4 billion in awarded contracts by Dec. 2016) are already well established in the Federal community. The enhanced target for each of these goals will require agencies to sharpen their focus on achieving the goals through existing mechanisms and new technologies that enhance efficiency and use of clean energy.</p>
<p>CEQ and OMB have worked closely to ensure that Federal agencies understand the necessary steps to pursuing the new environmental sustainability goals and those efforts are supported by an interagency Steering Committee.  Pursuit of these sustainability goals will involve at least 25 of the largest Federal agencies. Success will be greatly enhanced by the cross-cutting nature of the goals and the similarity in the tools and procedures used for implementation.</p>
<p>While all Federal agencies have an important role to play in ensuring the Government meets its energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets, key delivery agencies include: The General Services Administration, Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Energy, National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Department of Homeland Security.</p>

In the wake of increasing threats and incidents, the President directed a series of reviews to examine current security, suitability/fitness, and credentialing processes and to recommend areas in need of reform. The interagency reviews identified problem areas and made specific recommendations, which were approved by the Performance Accountability Council (PAC). The PAC developed the Strategic Intent to build upon these efforts and create a lasting impact by providing overarching strategic direction to personnel security, suitability/fitness, and credentialing reform efforts for the next five years.  </p>
<p>The Strategic Intent represents our framework for sustaining progress mandated by the February 2014 Suitability and Security Processes Review Report to the President, the January 2016 PAC Review of Background Investigations, relevant legislation, and other key drivers. It builds on progress since the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 and the subsequent, significant reform efforts that resulted in greater standardization and alignment of suitability and security processes. Through this framework, the PAC will work with other members of the Executive Branch to drive continuous process improvement to personnel security, suitability/fitness, and credentialing programs and address evolving threats. While we cannot eliminate risk altogether, it is imperative that we work across disciplines to maximize our collective efforts to mitigate the risks we face, while ensuring appropriate protections for privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. We must ensure measures to improve these programs avoid imposing unreasonable burdens on the Federal workforce that could negatively impact operations. Therefore, the Federal Government will pursue a balanced approach by addressing the risks posed by personnel who could do significant harm by virtue of the nature of their position.</p>
<p>These reforms will further support ongoing Insider Threat Program implementation by providing earlier detection and improving the quality of vetting. The improved attention to cybersecurity will reinforce efforts to protect sensitive mission data, including personally-identifiable information. </p>

According to AT Kearney’s Foreign Direct Investment Confidence Index, confidence in the U.S. as a location for FDI is high, ranking as the top destination for investment ahead of China, Brazil, Canada, and India.<sup>1 </sup>The U.S. remains the world’s largest economy and is also the largest recipient of foreign direct investment in the world. Over the last ten years, U.S. affiliates of foreign companies have employed more than five million workers, the majority of which are high-paying manufacturing jobs. On average, jobs created by FDI in United States pay up to 30% more.<sup>2</sup>  However, due to global capital mobility and increased foreign competition, we need to take steps to maintain and grow our share of global investment.</p>
<p>Historically, we have left our states and cities to compete for investments with a country’s investment promotion agency, limiting our opportunities to clearly demonstrate our commitment to attracting investment and to leverage our advantages as a top destination for investment. In 2011, through Executive Order, the U.S. launched SelectUSA, the first Federal effort to promote and facilitate inbound business investment. The E.O. created the Interagency Investment Working Group (IIWG) to further design and implement the first-ever coordinated U.S. investment promotion authority. As a driver for success, the global investment team, consisting of both SelectUSA headquarters in DC and investment teams at posts led by Ambassadors, will increase the number of active investment cases touched to encourage business investments.</p>
<p>At the first SelectUSA Investment Summit in Oct 31-Nov. 1 2013, the President reformed SelectUSA, creating a number of firsts: for the first time there will be a clear system for advocacy for high-priority, job-creating investments, driven by the most senior Administration officials all the way up to the President; for the first time there will be a single point of contact for ready investors looking to bring jobs and production to the U.S.; lastly, the Administration is engaging in unprecedented coordinated support for states and localities to attract investment.</p>
<p>Key contributing agencies to the Job-Creating Investment CAP goal include the Department of Commerce, Small Business Administration, US Department of Agriculture, Department of State, Department of Homeland Security, and Export-Import Bank of the U.S.</p>

Over time, the process and legal requirements for the permitting and review of major infrastructure projects have developed in a siloed and ad-hoc way, creating complex processes that in some cases have taken years or longer to complete.  Although there are several reasons why a major infrastructure project may be delayed (including applicant funding uncertainty and state and local reviews), over the past three years the Administration has undertaken an ambitious effort to modernize the Federal government’s role in permitting and review processes.</p>
<p>To ensure his Administration took action to modernize these permitting and review processes, on March 22, 2012, the President signed Executive Order 13604, Improving Performance of Federal Permitting and Review of Infrastructure Projects and subsequently a Presidential Memorandum on May 17, 2013, charging an interagency Steering Committee to lead the development of a plan to turn best practices into standard practice.  This Implementation Plan identifies four strategies, 15 reforms, and nearly 100 both near-term and long-term milestones.  The strategies are:</p>
<ul><li>Strategy 1: Institutionalize Interagency Coordination and Transparency, by formalizing interagency coordination policies, including early identification of a lead agency; synchronizing Federal review and permitting processes and decisions; standardizing the use of the Infrastructure Permitting Dashboard; and identifying best practices for early engagement with State, Local and Tribal governments.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Strategy 2:  Improve Project Planning, Siting, and Application Quality by developing tools to assist project applicants in planning for a major infrastructure project and support effective and timely decision-making by agency staff once the Federal processes begins. </li>
</ul><ul><li>Strategy 3: Improve Permitting Reviews and Mitigation by supporting agency staff in effectively implementing existing regulations, policies, and guidance as well as identifying barriers. This strategy also includes policies to facilitate advance planning for the mitigation of project impacts and landscape- or watershed-level approaches to mitigation, where appropriate.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Strategy 4: Drive Continued Improvement.  Fully implementing these actions and achieving the President’s goal will require a team dedicated to implementing the reforms on an interagency basis, further analyze agency processes, and identify additional reforms.  This strategy includes a proposal to establish a dedicated interagency team to support the ongoing improvement of Federal permitting and review responsibilities for major infrastructure projects.  In addition, this strategy includes a proposal to develop reliable metrics to track timeframes and outcomes for communities and the environment.</li>

Advances in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) have long been central to our Nation’s ability to manufacture better and smarter products, improve health care, develop cleaner and more efficient domestic energy sources, preserve the environment, safeguard national security, and grow the economy. For the United States to maintain its preeminent position in the world it will be essential that the Nation continues to lead in STEM, but evidence indicates that current educational pathways are not leading to a sufficiently large and well-trained STEM workforce to achieve this goal, nor is the U.S. education system cultivating a culture of STEM education necessary for a STEM-literate public. Thus it is essential that the United States enhance U.S. students’ engagement in STEM disciplines and inspire and equip many more students to excel in STEM fields.</p>
<p>A number of Federal agencies place a high priority on STEM education and have developed education initiatives unique to their agency’s mission, needs, and resources.  To better leverage Federal assets, expertise, and partnerships toward a goal of national importance, a cross agency priority to improve STEM education has been developed to increase agency coordination and use of evidence-based approaches to improve P-12 STEM instruction, increase and sustain youth and public engagement in STEM, enhance the STEM experience of undergraduate students, better serve groups historically underrepresented in STEM fields, design graduate education for tomorrow’s STEM workforce, build new models for leveraging assets and expertise, and build and use evidence-based approaches. </p>

  <div class="views-field views-field-field-cag-overview-revision-id">    <span class="views-label views-label-field-cag-overview-revision-id">Overview: </span>    <div class="field-content"><p>The American people deserve a Government that is responsive to their needs. Citizens and businesses expect government services to be well-designed, efficient, and generally comparable to the services they receive from leading private sector organizations. Whether they call the IRS for an answer to a tax question or visit a Social Security Administration office to adjust their benefits, they should experience high-quality interactions with the Federal Government. Despite some important strides to improve customer service over the past fifteen years, too often many Federal Government services fail to meet the expectations of citizens and business, creating unnecessary hassle and cost for citizens, businesses, and the government itself.  The Federal Government must keep pace with the public’s expectations and transform its customer services – soliciting regular customer feedback, streamlining processes, and delivering consistent quality service across customer channels.</p>
<p>To that end, in April 2011 the President issued an<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/27/executive-order-streamlining-service-delivery-and-improving-customer-ser" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/27/executive-order-streamlining-service-delivery-and-improving-customer-ser">Executive Order</a> requiring each agency to develop a customer service plan that identified implementation steps for their customer service activities, including a "signature initiative" that uses technology to improve the customer experience. Agencies posted the plans on their Open Government websites in October 2011, and this goal will build on these plans to streamline and improve customer service delivery.</p>
<p>To build upon the progress being made by individual agencies, the Administration is taking action to deliver improved customer service across the Federal enterprise.  The Administration will:</p>
<ul><li><em>Streamline transactions.</em>  Too often the processes and procedures of government have been developed piecemeal over time, and have not been regularly reexamined to ensure they are designed with the user experience in mind.  The Administration will identify transactions with a high impact on a significant number of citizens and streamline processes, better meet customer needs, and use performance measures to improve services.  This includes areas such as TSA security screening, veterans’ pension and disability applications, income-based repayment of student loans, Social Security, and taxpayer assistance.</li>
<li><em>Develop standards for high impact services.</em>  Citizen expectations for government services are continually increasing, driven by improvements in technology and the high quality services provided by the private sector.  Government leaders have a responsibility to understand customer expectations and service needs, and continually evaluate and improve their effectiveness in meeting those needs.  To facilitate this, many government programs that provide direct services to the public can benefit from setting customer service standards, clearly communicating these standards to customers, and ensuring these standards are being met.  The Administration will identify best practices in setting customer service standards, such as placing an emphasis on first contact resolution, and facilitate implementation of these practices for high impact services.</li>
<li><em>Utilize technology to improve the customer experience.</em>  The Administration will work to deliver world-class customer services to citizens by making it faster and easier for individuals and businesses to complete transactions with government online.  Given the continually growing importance of online services, the Administration has established a separate Cross-Agency Priority Goal to focus resources and attention on this priority area. </li>

The Administration will work with agencies to utilize existing authorities to attract top talent and consult with Agencies, the Office of Personnel Management, and Congressional stakeholders to expand the use of flexible hiring authorities. The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will also work with Agencies to incubate and scale new approaches to the design, development and delivery of top digital services and transactions.</li>
<li>Get the best companies working with government. The Administration’s efforts in this area will focus on streamlining the Federal IT acquisition process. Specific initiatives include creating more visibility of contracting opportunities for small, innovative companies; maximizing the use of available contracting flexibilities and best practices; and recommending administrative changes to the IT procurement processes.</li>
<li>Put the right processes and practices in place to drive outcomes and accountability. OMB will create and apply a new oversight and management process to highest impact IT investments in the Federal government. This process will include the best IT development and management approaches employed by the public and private sectors.  Lessons learned from this oversight process will be used to expand best practices across all agency IT investments.</li>

Today, proposals for contracts are lengthy, overly prescriptive, and laden with Government-specific requirements. There is also staggering duplication of contracts across Government and very little information sharing between agencies on pricing or other important contractual information. In order to fundamentally improve how taxpayer dollars are used in the Federal contracting space, the Administration is embarking on a comprehensive initiative to enhance collaboration and cooperation and drive greater innovation and improved performance through the implementation of Category Management.</p>
<p>This cross-agency priority (CAP) goal is focused on category management and will build on the progress made in the strategic sourcing initiative, leveraging the consolidated purchasing power of the Government to buy smarter and reduce duplication.  Category management is a new, more strategic approach that will enable the federal government to buy smarter and more like a single enterprise.  It involves identifying core areas of spend, developing heightened levels of expertise, leveraging shared best practices, providing streamlined solutions for acquisition, and managing supply and demand.  The objective is to increase efficiency and effectiveness while reducing costs and redundancies.  The first area of focus for category management is information technology and the CAP goal will support this initiative.  The objectives of the Category Management CAP goal will be expanded as the Category Management Leadership Council endorses other areas of focus.  The CAP Goal metrics can be found on the “supporting materials tabs” and progress updates will begin in the final Quarter of FY15.  </p>

If we are focused, committed, systematic, and intentional, we can make the sort of transformative changes in our service delivery approach that have altered the course of the commercial retail marketplace and reinvigorated American manufacturing. </p>
<p>We need to commit to driving efficiencies by creating opportunities to leverage existing resources and pool the government’s buying power.  This involves building common standards for underlying support activities and systems and driving out redundancy in administrative service provision.  It means changing agency expectations and incentives for spending.  And it means rethinking the way that the government considers and funds long-term investments in the systems and infrastructure that support customer service delivery. </p>
<p>The Federal Government will leverage the Executive Councils to develop common standards and benchmarks to measure shared service utilization, performance, and cost. Mandate those standards and benchmarks for common administrative services. From these standards and benchmarks we will drive efficiencies and greater performance by: 1) increasing the capacity of the Federal Shared Service Providers (SSPs) at DOI, USDA, Treasury, HHS, DOT and DOD; and 2) requiring use of lower-cost, higher-performing Shared Services for all agencies and SSPs which cannot meet established targets. We will target the following areas for Shared Services (listed in order of priority): financial, HR, technology, and acquisition.</p>

<p>The Administration will sustain and intensify these efforts in the second term by:</p>
<ul><li>Establishing cost and quality benchmarks for core/administrative operations, such as HR, Finance, Acquisition, and IT.  We will leverage the agency executive councils to develop common standards and benchmarks to measure shared service utilization, performance, and cost.  We will then use those standards and benchmarks for common administrative services as the baseline for driving continuous improvements in performance.</li>
<li>Cutting improper payments. Building on work already completed which has significantly reduced improper payments, we will advance data analytics and improved technology through the “Do Not Pay” tool to prevent these payments from happening, with the goal of a government-wide improper payment rate of 3 percent or less by the end of 2016.</li>

<p>The Administration has made significant progress in improving the management of information resources to increase interoperability and openness. In executive order 13642 President Obama outlined a clear vision for “Making Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information” wherever possible and legally permissible. The subsequently released Open Data Policy (OMB memorandum M-13-13) directed agencies to effectively “manage the information as a strategic asset” throughout its lifecycle and make data open by default to the extent permitted by law, while ensuring strict controls to safeguard individual privacy, confidentiality, and national security. </p>
<p>As a direct result, Americans are getting better access to government information and services they need. Homeowners who are struggling to pay their mortgages now get prompt, clear responses because companies are competing based on open consumer financial product complaint data published by CFPB, and can stay in their homes. Similarly, patients can now comparison shop to see which hospitals have the best outcomes and best prices thanks to data published by Medicaid and HHS—including a new dataset that for the first time shows what hospitals charge for inpatient services associated with the 100 most common kinds of hospital stays, revealing huge variations in hospital charges across the country and even within metro areas.</p>
<p>To drive further impact and results, the Open Data CAP Goal will focus on a series of government-wide objectives, strategies and major metrics that facilitate and gauge the outcome-oriented and management improvement goals of Open Data.  Metrics will prioritize three channels of impact measurement: impact on economic value creation organizations, impact on existing public program outcomes, and impact on internal government efficiency.  </p>

Though changes to policy or law may ultimately be needed to address workforce and cultural challenges across government, we can and should take actions to maximize the impact of our workforce within the existing environment.  We propose to:</p>
<ul><li>Create a Culture of Excellence and Engagement to Enable Higher Performance.  We will foster a culture of excellence by using data-driven approaches to enhance management, performance, and innovation across the current Federal workforce.  Specifically, we will focus on employee engagement (measured by employee views about their leaders, supervisors, and work experience), as multiple evaluations have demonstrated a strong correlation between employee engagement and an organization’s productivity.  Agencies can now get access to this data for over 13,000 work-level units across the country (up from just a few hundred units four years ago).  This level of specificity in data will provide agency managers with actionable information to target areas where improvement is needed most and where there are management best practices that can provide a model for success.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul><li>Build a World-Class Federal Management Team Starting with the Senior Executive Service (SES). To ensure a first-class Federal workforce long-term, we will invest in our civil service leadership by taking administrative actions that result in a broader experience and skill base across the Federal Executive Corps.  This includes addressing the “pain points” in the hiring process and enhancing training and accountability over the terms of their service.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul><li>Enable Agencies to Hire the Best Talent from All Segments of Society.  We will collaborate with Federal stakeholders and labor groups to ensure a balanced strategic approach to improving hiring outcomes. In the short term, we will identify and address the erosion of the original flexibilities of Title 5.  In the long term, we will work closely with labor unions and use demonstration projects and/or legislation and regulatory changes to ensure that our hiring processes attract and retain America’s talent.  We will measure the success of this effort by assessing manager satisfaction with the quality of both applicants and their hires after six months on the job. </li>

                    <p>Agencies establish a variety of organizational goals to drive progress toward key outcomes for the American people. Long-term strategic goals articulate clear statements of what the agency wants to achieve to advance its mission and address relevant national problems, needs, challenges and opportunities. Strategic objectives define the outcome or management impact the agency is trying to achieve, and also include the agency's role. Each strategic objective is tracked through a suite of performance goals, indicators and other evidence.

Growth in key foreign markets will help drive global economic recovery. More than one billion new consumers worldwide will enter the middle class during the next 15 years, and their buying power will increase the consumption of goods and services worldwide.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As economies around the world grow, some foreign governments develop policies that create barriers to U.S. companies in those markets. Such trade barriers and other unfair trade practices cost U.S. companies billions of dollars in lost revenue. Trade barriers result not only in financial loss, but also limit the ability of U.S. companies to expand production, hire additional workers, or pursue investment opportunities. Studies indicate that <em>trade openness</em> has added between $800 billion to $1.4 trillion to the U.S. economy since World War II, amounting to $7 thousand to $13 thousand per U.S. household.Removing the remaining trade barriers could result in an additional $400 billion to $1.3 trillion annually, or about an additional $4 thousand to $12 thousand per U.S. household.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Department will deploy its policy and promotional tools to help U.S. firms compete for new opportunities globally. A renewed focus on global competitiveness will help strengthen the long-term health of U.S. industries and stimulate domestic job creation. The Department will also use its strong expertise on export promotion and industry-economic-country issues to conduct holistic analyses of U.S. trade issues and needs, make recommendations, and take actions.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Foreign direct investment in the United States contributes significantly to U.S. economic growth and prosperity.  In 2011, value added by majority-owned U.S. affiliates of foreign companies accounted for 4.7 percent of total U.S. private output.  These firms employed 5.6 million people in the United States, or 4.1 percent of private-sector employment.  The United States competes with countries that have aggressive national programs to encourage businesses to move to or expand within their own borders.  In response to this competition, President Obama announced a federal <em>SelectUSA</em> initiative in 2011.  Led by the Department, <em>SelectUSA</em>, involves multiple Department bureaus, includes other federal agencies, and works alongside U.S. states and localities to advocate aggressively for the United States as a premier destination.  This coordinated federal effort assures the global investment community that <strong><em>America is open for business</em></strong>.  Furthermore, Department advocacy is backed up by capacity building grants to help communities create an economic ecosystem in which the private sector can leverage regional and community assets to promote foreign investment.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>As the federal agency charged with administering the U.S. antidumping and countervailing duty laws, the Department’s International Trade Administration (ITA) helps domestic manufacturers compete against unfairly traded imports into the United States.  ITA’s petition counseling unit helps U.S. workers and firms who assert damage from violations.  Focus is on assuring that small and medium-sized enterprises understand their rights and the requirements for filing a petition to initiate an investigation of possible foreign dumping and subsidization.  Once petitions seeking relief under the trade remedy laws are filed, ITA investigates the allegations. When imports are found to be dumped or subsidized and a cause of injury to U.S. industry, ITA instructs U.S. Customs and Border Protection to collect duties to offset the impact.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Department also offers assistance to U.S. exporters and investors, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, by coordinating government resources to overcome trade barriers.  This assistance educates U.S. industry on international trade agreements that maintain open markets . ITA’s trade experts monitor foreign government compliance with the more than 250 trade agreements so companies, investors, and workers realize the benefits of the agreements.  Through its full range of legal, analytical, investigatory, trade policy, and commercial expertise, the Department provides robust and comprehensive services to help U.S. exporters confront, forestall, and resolve foreign unfair trade practices.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The United States excels at basic science and invention.  But the commercial and economic rewards that emerge from these accomplishments are primarily realized only after discovery—especially at the points of manufacturing scale-up and commercialization.  This is particularly true for complex, cost-efficient, high-value-added products whose commercialization requires development and mastery of equally complex manufacturing processes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As overall U.S. R&amp;D efforts have begun to lag that of other nations, the composition of industrial R&amp;D has shifted toward short-term research.  These trends leave industry's long-term needs unmet and ultimately undermine the nation's competitiveness.  The Department is ideally positioned to address these challenges through its unique convening power.  It will bring together public-private partnerships that can produce cutting edge research.  These partnerships with businesses will accelerate technology development and commercialization, and strengthen the nation’s position in the global competition for new products, new markets, and new jobs.  In addition, NIST is the only research laboratory in the U.S. government specifically focused on enhancing industrial competitiveness, including a robust research portfolio concentrated on the technical challenges particularly associated with advanced manufacturing.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>This extraordinary platform for innovation, growth, and social progress faces urgent policy questions that demand a thoughtful government response.  How can personal information and intellectual property be protected online?  How can the Nation’s critical digital infrastructure be defended from cyber-attacks?  How can high-speed and affordable Internet access for all Americans be ensured? And, how can these goals be achieved while preserving, here and around the world, the fundamentally open nature of the Internet, free from unnecessary regulation?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Department has essential responsibility and a central role in answering these questions.  It advises the President on telecommunications issues and manages national spectrum resources needed for expanded high-speed broadband service.  It develops U.S. policy on online intellectual property protection and enforcement.  It oversees the development of voluntary industry cybersecurity and other online safety standards.  It houses FirstNet which is charged with building a nationwide wireless broadband network for public safety users.  And, the Department represents the United States on Internet governance issues before international multi-stakeholder bodies.</p>

Broadband access also affords public safety agencies the opportunity for greater levels of effectiveness and interoperability.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) manages the implementation of BTOP to expand broadband service to communities in a cost-effective manner that maximizes impacts on economic growth, education, health care, and public safety. BTOP is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). After a rigorous application and review process, NTIA invested approximately $4 billion in 233 BTOP projects benefiting every state, territory, and the District of Columbia. Most of NTIA’s broadband grant investments, 123 grant awards totaling more than $3.48 billion, fund the construction or upgrade of approximately 110,000 miles of broadband networks and employ multiple technologies, including fiber-optics, wireless, and other technologies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Network miles are a direct indicator of the nation’s growing broadband infrastructure, and represent both the increasing ability of underserved communities to contribute to America’s global competitiveness and the foundation for more affordable broadband services to homes and businesses. NTIA broadband grant investments will connect more than 24,000 community anchor institutions (e.g., libraries, hospitals, and schools), and add more than 650,000 new household and business subscribers to broadband service.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>NTIA continues to monitor and provide guidance to grant recipients through technical assistance on refining methodologies for collecting data on new subscribers and accurately reporting that information. NTIA also collects reports from grant recipients regularly detailing performance and performs case reviews evaluating projects’ successes and challenges in meeting milestones.  These activities help NTIA understand the progress made by recipients and inform the provision of appropriate corrective actions and enforcement measures, if needed.</p>

                                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>The purpose of this goal is to show that by implementing rigorous limits on annual catch, the U.S. can end and prevent overfishing. This is a key step to ensuring the sustainable management of our nation’s fisheries.  Federal fishery management is based on the concept of maximum sustainable yield, which is the largest long-term average catch that can be taken from a stock under prevailing environmental and fishery conditions.  A stock that is subject to overfishing has a fishing mortality (harvest) rate higher than the rate that produces maximum sustainable yield. The amount of catch equivalent to this harvest rate is the overfishing limit (OFL).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Magnuson-Stevens Act is the primary law that governs how fisheries are managed in U.S. federal waters.  When the Magnuson-Stevens Act was reauthorized in 2007, it mandated that annual catch limits (ACLs) be put in place for all federally managed domestic fish stocks, with certain exceptions.  ACLs are set at a level below the OFL to account for scientific uncertainty and to reduce the risk of overfishing.  ACLs are in place for all fish stocks as required by the Magnuson-Stevens Act.  These catch limits should keep catch below the OFL and prevent overfishing on these stocks.  Preventing overfishing should increase the long-term economic and social benefits of the nation’s fisheries.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>A key way to measure improvements in model performance is to examine how far into the future Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) guidance demonstrates skill.  Model output ceases to have useful skill at predicting the weather at longer forecast lengths.  Large scale weather patterns that affect the local weather that each of us experience on a daily basis, are driven by features in the mid-levels of the atmosphere.  During the past 20 years, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA’s) National Weather Service (NWS) has seen its ability to provide useful predictions of future high-impact weather events extend from 6 days to 8 days.</p>
<p>This goal focuses on improving the Global Forecast System model 2013 that currently has useful skill at forecasting the mid-levels of the atmosphere across the globe out to 8.0 days. Upon completion of forecasting upgrades over the next two years, the NWS expects to extend this out to 9 days.</p>
<p>Improving global weather prediction facilitates improvements to regional, local scale models that provide accurate information about the formation and movement of high impact storms in the right place at the right time.  Knowing with a good level of confidence that the storm is coming 5 days in advance enables for significantly improved response.  Evacuations from hurricanes require 3 full days, and thus accurate, consistent forecasts 4-7 days in advance are invaluable to people who have to make these critical decisions.  Increased lead time means lives saved and property protected.  NWS will also continue efforts to support the use of improved weather forecast data by emergency managers through better impact-based decision support services.  Achieving this priority goal will allow NWS to predict farther into the future and enable the American public to make the right choices when extreme weather threatens.</p>

<p> </p>
<p> Barriers to accessing and using the data must be minimized in order to realize the potential value of the data Commerce collects, stores, and disseminates,.  There are differing standards, methodologies, operations, infrastructures, websites, architecture, platforms, and formats that make it difficult to access, find, use, and combine data sets.  Commerce will undertake a comprehensive effort to improve the interoperability of our own data, both through internally-adopted standards and Commerce-wide efforts to better integrate our own data and making Commerce data more accessible and usable to the public.  Consistent with privacy and security considerations, Commerce is firmly committed to unleashing its untapped data resources in ways that best support downstream information access, processing, analytics, and dissemination.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Partnering with the private sector will increase the capacity of Commerce to release raw scientific and climate data that cannot be cost-effectively disseminated by the Federal government under current resource constraints.  Public-private commitments to adhere to sets of common standards and architectures could also result in a powerful data platform that would help provide more widespread access to public data in usable forms.  However, this infrastructure and its enabling standards will only work if they are developed collaboratively between the public and private sectors, partnering with each other.  This increased openness and interoperability needs to start in house.  Commerce will undertake a comprehensive effort to improve the interoperability of our own data, both through internally–adopted standards and Commerce-wide efforts to better integrate our own data.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In sum, Commerce will lead efforts to make sure government data is accessible in ways to make our businesses more competitive, our governments smarter, and our citizens more informed.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>We realize that to be leaders in the data revolution, we must look to our own ways of doing business and push them forward – hard.  We cannot lead without reforming ourselves.  In short, we must practice what we preach.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This strategic objective includes re-evaluating the relative usefulness of the data Commerce collects and whether that data is being used to support evidenced-based program management decisions within the government.  For example, Commerce intends to use its existing data, along with data obtained from other Federal agencies, to help design the 2020 Census and potentially save billions of dollars.  Making more and better use of data will require the ability to combine different data from different agencies to create new, more useful data products, and sharing data across agencies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our customers demand efficiency.  Businesses, governments, and the public at large will benefit from the enhanced value of our data products and services and from the resultant savings.  Businesses and the public will see reduced demands for information, lessening their concerns about survey response burdens, confidentiality of data, and privacy.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>By partnering with the business community and the private sector at large, we will generate new data products helping grow current businesses and catalyze the development of new businesses.  Through outreach to the business community and users, we will measure customer demand and determine what new data products to produce.  Generating these new products will be done in one of three ways, depending on the nature of what is needed:  (1) using in-house, traditional means and methods to produce new data products; (2) partnering with the private sector to couple its data with government data; or (3) providing government data in ways that are more useful to businesses and others so they can more easily combine it with their own private data resources.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our business customers will be the first beneficiaries of this process.  But the 90,000 governmental entities and nearly 320 million Americans that we serve will benefit from the new data products and services that are fueled by our efforts.</p>

The International Trade Administration (ITA) is committed to providing high-quality assistance that helps U.S. companies achieve their export objectives. This priority goal focuses on improving the quality of assistance ITA’s trade and commercial specialists provide to companies and supports objective 1.2 (<a href="http://www.commerce.gov/sites/commerce.gov/files/media/files/2014/doc_fy14-18_goals_and_objectives.pdf">Increase U.S. exports</a>) under the Trade and Investment strategic goal in the Department of Commerce’s Strategic Plan.  ITA’s delivery of substantive, high value-added assistance is affirmed when companies receiving this assistance respond that they have achieved their export objectives.  The Global Markets (GM) business unit within ITA is the organizational lead on this priority goal.</p>
<p>It is imperative that GM employees worldwide – all of whom interact with U.S. companies – are unified behind a common goal that focuses on the needs of customers. The FY 2011–FY 2014 baseline average percentage of companies assisted that achieved their export objectives was 69% for GM’s fee-for-service clients. To achieve this priority goal, GM seeks to understand individual U.S. company needs to be successful internationally and, subsequently, offer a customized approach to meet those needs drawing on the full resources available across ITA and the Federal Government. This approach steers ITA professionals toward identifying problems and challenges with exporting, and designing holistic solutions.  It focuses ITA on engaging with clients to offer substantive, high value-added assistance, such as helping companies select the best markets to enter, overcoming export trade barriers, or finding suitable international business partners.</p>
<p>Possible barriers and challenges to achieving this priority goal originally included the transition to a new survey system within ITA’s new Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system; however, ITA successfully replaced its survey system and has not experienced barriers or challenges to date.</p>

This priority goal supports the Department of Commerce’s longer-term goal focused on achieving 10 months for first action pendency and 20 months for total pendency by FY 2019.</p>
</p>
                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>American innovators and businesses rely on the legal rights associated with patents in order to reap the benefits of their innovations. Timely issuance of high-quality patents provides certainty in the market and allows businesses and innovators to make informed, timely decisions on product and service development.  Processing patent applications in a quality and timely manner advances economic prosperity by using intellectual property (IP) as a tool to create a business environment that cultivates and protects new ideas, technologies, services and products.</p>
<p>Our dedicated employees have reduced the patent application backlog from a high of over 764,000 in January 2009 to 558,091 in October 2015, a 27 percent reduction. Between the end of fiscal year (FY) 2009 and the end of October 2015, first action pendency decreased by 8.8 months and total pendency by eight months. First action pendency measures the time from when an application is filed to the mailing date of the initial communication to the applicant from the patent examiner.  The USPTO did not meet the first action pendency FY 16 goal.  Given the lower-than-expected filings in FY 2015, at the beginning of FY 2016 the USPTO projected a 1 percent overall growth in UPR filings; however, actual growth was in excess of 5 percent, and consequently the first action pendency result was negatively impacted.</p>
<p>Total pendency measures the time from filing until an application is either issued as a patent or abandoned.  The USPTO did meet its FY 2016 goal. </p>
<p>Additionally, from an all-time high of 111,924 in February 2013, the Request for Continued Examination (RCE) backlog was reduced to 27,394 in October 2015, a 75.5 percent reduction.</p>
<p>We want to continue to build on these successes, and the America Invents Act (AIA) legislation passed by Congress supports doing just that.  The AIA allows us to set our fees and retain fees collected above our appropriated level. This means our financial health is more stable than in the past, giving us a unique opportunity to further expand our quality efforts throughout the entire process.</p>
<p>Patent quality is central to fulfilling a core mission of the USPTO, which as stated in the Constitution, is to “promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts.” It is critically important that the USPTO issue patents that are both <strong>correct </strong><em><u>and </u></em><strong>clear</strong>. Historically, our primary focus has been on correctness, but the evolving patent landscape has challenged us to increase our focus on clarity. </p>
<p>Patents of the highest quality can help to stimulate and promote efficient licensing, research and development, and future innovation, without resorting to high-cost court proceedings. Through correctness and clarity, such patents better enable potential users of patented technologies to make informed decisions on how to avoid infringement, whether to seek a license, and/or when to settle or litigate a patent dispute. Patent owners also benefit from having clear notice on the boundaries of their patent rights.</p>

</p>
                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>Major weather events continue to demonstrate the importance of hazard preparedness and response in the United States.  </p>
<p>The Department of Commerce’s Strategic Plan Strategic Objective 3.2, Build a Weather-Ready Nation, and the National Weather Service’s (NWS) Weather-Ready Nation goal focus on building community resilience in the face of increasing vulnerability to extreme weather and water events and providing timely and useful information to the emergency management community. A strong link exists between achieving the Department’s mission to create the conditions for economic growth and opportunity, and mitigating the economic impacts of weather events on businesses and communities. The Nation is becoming more dependent on weather prediction capabilities. Industries are demanding more weather information to make informed business decisions.</p>
<p>Becoming a Weather-Ready Nation involves the ability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from weather and water events. To ensure that the United States has a Weather Service that is second-to-none, and meet the demands for more accurate and reliable forecasts and warnings, we need to advance our weather models faster.</p>
<p>More lead time for the prediction of weather events allows people and businesses to make informed choices and enables better protection of life, property and enhancement of the National economy. Knowing that a major snow storm is coming 20 hours before the first snowflake is useful. Knowing with a good level of confidence that a storm is coming in 5 days vastly improves the response. Evacuations for hurricanes require 3 full days. An accurate, consistent forecast 4-7 days in advance is invaluable to people who have to make critical evacuation decisions. Travel-related evacuation costs can exceed $1 million for every 10,000 people evacuated.<sup>1</sup> </p>
<p>Events such as the unprecedented drought conditions in California, repeated flooding in the Ohio Valley, and massive snow storms across the Northeast (which caused a shut down during the winter of 2015) further demonstrate the need for improved forecasting accuracy and lead times for high impact and extreme weather. Severe weather can lead to massive traffic jams, stranded vehicles, and shutdowns of airports, mass transit systems, roads, schools, and businesses. It prompted the issuance of states of emergency declarations in major cities across the Northeast during the winter of 2015. Shutdown of air and sea transportation routes, construction delays, and the late deliveries of goods and services, impact the wages and the economic health of our nation in both the short and long term. </p>
<p>Increased lead time means more time to take the necessary actions to prepare for and protect individuals from high impact and extreme weather events. For example, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will have more time to make critical decisions regarding rerouting or grounding of planes. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will have more time to coordinate evacuation planning and contingency plans supporting Federal, State, and local efforts. Likewise, businesses will have more time to make better decisions necessary to protect their employees and customers and lessen potential economic impacts. Ultimately, this leads to lives saved, property protected and reduction in negative weather impacts to the economy. </p>
<p>Our FY 14-15 Agency Priority Goal (APG), Improve Forecasting Accuracy and Lead Times for Severe Weather, used a deterministic approach based on the performance of a single model. The FY16-17 goal is based on an approach using an ensemble system of global model output, which provides more robust model guidance including estimates of forecast uncertainty and reliability. The ensemble enables forecasters to communicate both the severity and likelihood of predicted weather impacts. Since December 1992, global ensemble forecasts have been part of NWS’ operational suite of forecast model guidance and use of this approach is highlighted in the reports of the National Academy of Sciences, <em>Weather Services for the Nation: Becoming Second to None</em> and the National Academy of Public Administration, <em>Forecast for the Future: Assuring the Capacity of the National Weather Service</em>. The atmosphere is a chaotic system with a significant uncertainty in each forecast. Ensemble weather forecast model guidance entails running a numeric weather prediction model multiple times, with perturbations in the initial conditions and/or model settings, to estimate inherent uncertainty in atmospheric conditions and provide a better estimate for the range of future states of the atmosphere. Use of ensemble weather forecast model guidance provides more useful forecast information that quantifies the uncertainty used to communicate risk for more informed decision making in response to incoming extreme weather events.    </p>
<p>Over the next two years, NWS will continue to extend the useful lead time<sup>3</sup> of its ensemble weather forecast model guidance out to 9.5 days through:</p>
<ol><li>Increasing Computing Capacity</li>
<li>Achieving Higher Model Resolution and improved Physics.</li>
<li>Improving Data Assimilation Methodology.</li>
<li>Incorporating New Satellite Observations into NWP Models.</li>
</ol><p>Improving our global weather prediction skill facilitates improvements to our regional, local scale models that provide accurate information about the formation and movement of high impact storms in the right place at the right time. Our goal is to see farther into the future and enable the American public to make the right choices when extreme weather threatens. </p>

</p>
                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is an agency that enriches and safeguards life through science. Our reach is the surface of the sun to the depths of the ocean floor as we work to keep citizens informed of the changing environment around them. Often what limits the ability to make predictions is the complexity and interconnectedness of large-scale physical and ecological systems. In order to reach this goal, NOAA will develop a suite of state-of-the-art models, and transition them to operational settings. These models will integrate physical and biological observations. They will provide Earth system predictions at varying geographic scales across time from minutes to decades to meet the needs of specific users. The twelve transitions refine the models being developed as well as create new models by moving new capabilities from a research and development (R&amp;D) environment to an operations environment. This allows for more accurate, reliable, usable, sustainable, and precise forecasts, which provides for the protection of life and property and the enhancement to the national economy. Operationalizing these forecasts will allow people to make decisions that they would otherwise not be able to make, to take action and avoid the adverse impacts of the events being forecasted. </p>
<p>This goal captures NOAA’s intent to increase the number and pace of advancing scientific and technological capabilities that transition from R&amp;D to applications. Without expeditiously transitioning new capabilities from R&amp;D, we cannot “ensure communities and businesses have the necessary information, products, services to prepare for, and prosper in, a changing environment” (Department of Commerce Strategic Goal #3). Improving our capacity to use the results of federal R&amp;D in socially and economically valuable applications is a priority of the NOAA Administrator, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Administration.</p>
<p>The goal is to transition a targeted number of discrete NOAA R&amp;D products to operations in a NOAA service (e.g. new forecast models enter the National Weather Service (NWS) operations) or to the public or commercial sectors (e.g. new technologies licensed to a private firm). It is important to note that this goal is not specific to NOAA’s weather, climate, oceans, and coasts missions. Rather, it cross-cuts these NOAA functions and is intended to accelerate the application of R&amp;D results as a NOAA-wide priority for increased organizational excellence.</p>
<p>To standardize reporting, NOAA will use Technical Readiness Levels (TRLs) similar to those applied at National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and other federal agencies to track system maturity. TRLs are a systematic project measurement system that describes or tracks progress of projects from research to operation, application, commercial product or service, or other use. It allows the consistent comparison of maturity between different types of R&amp;D projects. A project achieves a readiness level once it has accomplished all elements described within a readiness level. A complete transition is a capability that has progressed from TRL 8 to TRL 9. TRL 8 is defined as a completed and operational system, process, product, service or tool. TRL 9 is defined as a system, process, product, service or tool deployed by NOAA and routinely in operations.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>A key way to measure improvements in model performance is to examine how far into the future Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) guidance demonstrates skill.  Model output ceases to have useful skill at predicting the weather at longer forecast lengths.  Large scale weather patterns that affect the local weather that each of us experience on a daily basis, are driven by features in the mid-levels of the atmosphere.  During the past 20 years, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA’s) National Weather Service (NWS) has seen its ability to provide useful predictions of future high-impact weather events extend from 6 days to 8 days.</p>
<p>This goal focuses on improving the Global Forecast System model 2013 that currently has useful skill at forecasting the mid-levels of the atmosphere across the globe out to 8.0 days. Upon completion of forecasting upgrades over the next two years, the NWS expects to extend this out to 9 days.</p>
<p>Improving global weather prediction facilitates improvements to regional, local scale models that provide accurate information about the formation and movement of high impact storms in the right place at the right time.  Knowing with a good level of confidence that the storm is coming 5 days in advance enables for significantly improved response.  Evacuations from hurricanes require 3 full days, and thus accurate, consistent forecasts 4-7 days in advance are invaluable to people who have to make these critical decisions.  Increased lead time means lives saved and property protected.  NWS will also continue efforts to support the use of improved weather forecast data by emergency managers through better impact-based decision support services.  Achieving this priority goal will allow NWS to predict farther into the future and enable the American public to make the right choices when extreme weather threatens.</p>

<p>The Magnuson-Stevens Act is the primary law that governs how fisheries are managed in U.S. federal waters.  When the Magnuson-Stevens Act was reauthorized in 2007, it mandated that annual catch limits (ACLs) be put in place for all federally managed domestic fish stocks, with certain exceptions.  ACLs are set at a level below the OFL to account for scientific uncertainty and to reduce the risk of overfishing.  ACLs are in place for all fish stocks as required by the Magnuson-Stevens Act.  These catch limits should keep catch below the OFL and prevent overfishing on these stocks.  Preventing overfishing should increase the long-term economic and social benefits of the nation’s fisheries.</p>

</p>
                               <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>Broadband access is essential to U.S. global competitiveness in the 21st century, driving job creation, promoting innovation, and expanding markets for American businesses. Broadband access also affords public safety agencies the opportunity for greater levels of effectiveness and interoperability.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) manages the implementation of BTOP to expand broadband service to communities in a cost-effective manner that maximizes impacts on economic growth, education, health care, and public safety. BTOP is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). After a rigorous application and review process, NTIA invested approximately $4 billion in 233 BTOP projects benefiting every state, territory, and the District of Columbia. Most of NTIA’s broadband grant investments, 123 grant awards totaling more than $3.48 billion, fund the construction or upgrade of approximately 110,000 miles of broadband networks and employ multiple technologies, including fiber-optics, wireless, and other technologies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Network miles are a direct indicator of the nation’s growing broadband infrastructure, and represent both the increasing ability of underserved communities to contribute to America’s global competitiveness and the foundation for more affordable broadband services to homes and businesses. NTIA broadband grant investments will connect more than 24,000 community anchor institutions (e.g., libraries, hospitals, and schools), and add more than 650,000 new household and business subscribers to broadband service.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>NTIA continues to monitor and provide guidance to grant recipients through technical assistance on refining methodologies for collecting data on new subscribers and accurately reporting that information. NTIA also collects reports from grant recipients regularly detailing performance and performs case reviews evaluating projects’ successes and challenges in meeting milestones.  These activities help NTIA understand the progress made by recipients and inform the provision of appropriate corrective actions and enforcement measures, if needed.</p>

The International Trade Administration (ITA) is committed to providing high-quality assistance that helps U.S. companies achieve their export objectives. This priority goal focuses on improving the quality of assistance ITA’s trade and commercial specialists provide to companies. ITA’s delivery of substantive, high value-added assistance is affirmed when companies receiving this assistance respond that they have achieved their export objectives. The Global Markets business unit within ITA is the organizational lead on this priority goal. It is imperative that Global Markets staff worldwide – all of whom interact with U.S. companies – are unified behind a common goal that focuses on unique needs of our customers. The FY12 – FY13 baseline average percentage of companies assisted that achieved their export objectives is 67 percent for ITA’s fee-for-service clients. To achieve this priority goal, Global Markets has sought to understand individual U.S. company needs to be successful internationally and, subsequently, offered a customized approach that draws on the full resources available across ITA and the Federal Government to meet those needs. This strategic shift towards offering a more consultative approach steers ITA professionals toward identifying the problems and challenges with exporting, and designing holistic solutions. It focuses ITA on engaging with clients to offer substantive, high value-added assistance, such as helping companies select the best markets to enter, overcoming export trade barriers, or finding suitable international business partners.</p>
