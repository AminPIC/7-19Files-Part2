<div class="intro_text">
<p>Established by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goals are a tool used to accelerate progress on a limited number of priority areas where implementation requires active collaboration between multiple agencies, overcoming organizational barriers to achieve better performance than one agency can achieve on its own.</p>
<p>Set or revised at least every four years, CAP Goals include outcome-oriented goals that cover a limited number of crosscutting policy areas as well as management goals focused on management improvements across the Federal Government in areas of financial management, strategic human capital management, information technology management, procurement and acquisition management, and real property management.</p>
<p>A series of 16 CAP Goals were announced in the 2015 Budget with clearly named accountable officials, data-driven reviews that incorporated a broad range of quantitative and qualitative inputs, and reporting to the public through a common website as a framework to drive performance improvements on cross-government collaboration and tackle government-wide management challenges affecting most agencies.</p>

<p>On June 30, 2016, the President signed into law the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 – nearly 50 years after President Johnson signed the original FOIA into law.  This critical legislation reflects the progress made by the Administration, codifies a number of openness and transparency principles, and ensures that the Administration’s track record of openness is institutionalized throughout government and carries forward for years to come.  Concurrent with the signing of the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, the White House released a Fact Sheet committing the Administration to:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Utilizing the Chief FOIA Officers Council and FOIA Advisory Committee to address FOIA’s greatest challenges;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promoting broader release of records through a “release to one is a release to all” presumption;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Launching a centralized FOIA request portal; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Issuing new guidance on open government principles and actions.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The Administration also announced the creation of a FOIA Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goal as a framework for tracking progress on the Administration’s commitments and key requirements of the Act.  Under the cross-agency leadership of the Department of Justice, National Archives and Records Administration, and Office of Management and Budget, the Administration remains committed to assisting agencies in their efforts to improve implementation of the FOIA and leveraging technology to achieve a new era of open government.  </p>

</div>  </div>  
  <div class="views-field views-field-field-cag-overview-revision-id">    <span class="views-label views-label-field-cag-overview-revision-id">Overview: </span>    <div class="field-content"><p>On March 19, 2015, the President issued Executive Order 13693, <em>Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade</em>, which set forth ambitious climate, energy, and environmental sustainability goals for Federal agencies over the next decade.  Executive departments and agencies have been among our Nation’s leaders as the United States works to build a clean energy economy that will sustain our prosperity and the health of our people and our environment for generations to come. Federal leadership in energy, environmental water, transportation fleets, buildings, and acquisition management will continue to drive national greenhouse gas reductions and support preparations for the impacts of climate change. The Federal Government has the opportunity to significantly reduce direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2025, while at the same time fostering innovation, reducing spending, and strengthening the communities in which our Federal facilities operate. </p>
<p>Employing this strategy for the next decade calls for expanded and updated Federal environmental performance goals with a clear overarching objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions across Federal operations and the Federal supply chain.  Goals for greenhouse gas emissions reduction (40% by 2025), renewable electricity (30% by 2025), clean energy (25% by 2025), and performance contracting ($4 billion in awarded contracts by Dec. 2016) are already well established in the Federal community. The enhanced target for each of these goals will require agencies to sharpen their focus on achieving the goals through existing mechanisms and new technologies that enhance efficiency and use of clean energy.</p>
<p>CEQ and OMB have worked closely to ensure that Federal agencies understand the necessary steps to pursuing the new environmental sustainability goals and those efforts are supported by an interagency Steering Committee.  Pursuit of these sustainability goals will involve at least 25 of the largest Federal agencies. Success will be greatly enhanced by the cross-cutting nature of the goals and the similarity in the tools and procedures used for implementation.</p>
<p>While all Federal agencies have an important role to play in ensuring the Government meets its energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets, key delivery agencies include: The General Services Administration, Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Energy, National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Department of Homeland Security.</p>

In the wake of increasing threats and incidents, the President directed a series of reviews to examine current security, suitability/fitness, and credentialing processes and to recommend areas in need of reform. The interagency reviews identified problem areas and made specific recommendations, which were approved by the Performance Accountability Council (PAC). The PAC developed the Strategic Intent to build upon these efforts and create a lasting impact by providing overarching strategic direction to personnel security, suitability/fitness, and credentialing reform efforts for the next five years.  </p>
<p>The Strategic Intent represents our framework for sustaining progress mandated by the February 2014 Suitability and Security Processes Review Report to the President, the January 2016 PAC Review of Background Investigations, relevant legislation, and other key drivers. It builds on progress since the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 and the subsequent, significant reform efforts that resulted in greater standardization and alignment of suitability and security processes. Through this framework, the PAC will work with other members of the Executive Branch to drive continuous process improvement to personnel security, suitability/fitness, and credentialing programs and address evolving threats. While we cannot eliminate risk altogether, it is imperative that we work across disciplines to maximize our collective efforts to mitigate the risks we face, while ensuring appropriate protections for privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. We must ensure measures to improve these programs avoid imposing unreasonable burdens on the Federal workforce that could negatively impact operations. Therefore, the Federal Government will pursue a balanced approach by addressing the risks posed by personnel who could do significant harm by virtue of the nature of their position.</p>
<p>These reforms will further support ongoing Insider Threat Program implementation by providing earlier detection and improving the quality of vetting. The improved attention to cybersecurity will reinforce efforts to protect sensitive mission data, including personally-identifiable information. </p>

According to AT Kearney’s Foreign Direct Investment Confidence Index, confidence in the U.S. as a location for FDI is high, ranking as the top destination for investment ahead of China, Brazil, Canada, and India.<sup>1 </sup>The U.S. remains the world’s largest economy and is also the largest recipient of foreign direct investment in the world. Over the last ten years, U.S. affiliates of foreign companies have employed more than five million workers, the majority of which are high-paying manufacturing jobs. On average, jobs created by FDI in United States pay up to 30% more.<sup>2</sup>  However, due to global capital mobility and increased foreign competition, we need to take steps to maintain and grow our share of global investment.</p>
<p>Historically, we have left our states and cities to compete for investments with a country’s investment promotion agency, limiting our opportunities to clearly demonstrate our commitment to attracting investment and to leverage our advantages as a top destination for investment. In 2011, through Executive Order, the U.S. launched SelectUSA, the first Federal effort to promote and facilitate inbound business investment. The E.O. created the Interagency Investment Working Group (IIWG) to further design and implement the first-ever coordinated U.S. investment promotion authority. As a driver for success, the global investment team, consisting of both SelectUSA headquarters in DC and investment teams at posts led by Ambassadors, will increase the number of active investment cases touched to encourage business investments.</p>
<p>At the first SelectUSA Investment Summit in Oct 31-Nov. 1 2013, the President reformed SelectUSA, creating a number of firsts: for the first time there will be a clear system for advocacy for high-priority, job-creating investments, driven by the most senior Administration officials all the way up to the President; for the first time there will be a single point of contact for ready investors looking to bring jobs and production to the U.S.; lastly, the Administration is engaging in unprecedented coordinated support for states and localities to attract investment.</p>
<p>Key contributing agencies to the Job-Creating Investment CAP goal include the Department of Commerce, Small Business Administration, US Department of Agriculture, Department of State, Department of Homeland Security, and Export-Import Bank of the U.S.</p>

  <div class="views-field views-field-field-cag-overview-revision-id">    <span class="views-label views-label-field-cag-overview-revision-id">Overview: </span>    <div class="field-content"><p>Building a 21st century infrastructure in a manner that safeguards our communities and the environment is an important component of President Obama’s effort to strengthen our Nation’s economy, create new jobs, and improve U.S. competitiveness in the global market.  Federal agencies seek to ensure that as these major infrastructure projects are proposed, potential impacts on safety, security, and environmental and community resources such as air, water, land, and historical and cultural resources are considered and minimized. Over time, the process and legal requirements for the permitting and review of major infrastructure projects have developed in a siloed and ad-hoc way, creating complex processes that in some cases have taken years or longer to complete.  Although there are several reasons why a major infrastructure project may be delayed (including applicant funding uncertainty and state and local reviews), over the past three years the Administration has undertaken an ambitious effort to modernize the Federal government’s role in permitting and review processes.</p>
<p>To ensure his Administration took action to modernize these permitting and review processes, on March 22, 2012, the President signed Executive Order 13604, Improving Performance of Federal Permitting and Review of Infrastructure Projects and subsequently a Presidential Memorandum on May 17, 2013, charging an interagency Steering Committee to lead the development of a plan to turn best practices into standard practice.  This Implementation Plan identifies four strategies, 15 reforms, and nearly 100 both near-term and long-term milestones.  The strategies are:</p>
<ul><li>Strategy 1: Institutionalize Interagency Coordination and Transparency, by formalizing interagency coordination policies, including early identification of a lead agency; synchronizing Federal review and permitting processes and decisions; standardizing the use of the Infrastructure Permitting Dashboard; and identifying best practices for early engagement with State, Local and Tribal governments.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Strategy 2:  Improve Project Planning, Siting, and Application Quality by developing tools to assist project applicants in planning for a major infrastructure project and support effective and timely decision-making by agency staff once the Federal processes begins. </li>
</ul><ul><li>Strategy 3: Improve Permitting Reviews and Mitigation by supporting agency staff in effectively implementing existing regulations, policies, and guidance as well as identifying barriers. This strategy also includes policies to facilitate advance planning for the mitigation of project impacts and landscape- or watershed-level approaches to mitigation, where appropriate.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Strategy 4: Drive Continued Improvement.  Fully implementing these actions and achieving the President’s goal will require a team dedicated to implementing the reforms on an interagency basis, further analyze agency processes, and identify additional reforms.  This strategy includes a proposal to establish a dedicated interagency team to support the ongoing improvement of Federal permitting and review responsibilities for major infrastructure projects.  In addition, this strategy includes a proposal to develop reliable metrics to track timeframes and outcomes for communities and the environment.</li>

Advances in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) have long been central to our Nation’s ability to manufacture better and smarter products, improve health care, develop cleaner and more efficient domestic energy sources, preserve the environment, safeguard national security, and grow the economy. For the United States to maintain its preeminent position in the world it will be essential that the Nation continues to lead in STEM, but evidence indicates that current educational pathways are not leading to a sufficiently large and well-trained STEM workforce to achieve this goal, nor is the U.S. education system cultivating a culture of STEM education necessary for a STEM-literate public. Thus it is essential that the United States enhance U.S. students’ engagement in STEM disciplines and inspire and equip many more students to excel in STEM fields.</p>
<p>A number of Federal agencies place a high priority on STEM education and have developed education initiatives unique to their agency’s mission, needs, and resources.  To better leverage Federal assets, expertise, and partnerships toward a goal of national importance, a cross agency priority to improve STEM education has been developed to increase agency coordination and use of evidence-based approaches to improve P-12 STEM instruction, increase and sustain youth and public engagement in STEM, enhance the STEM experience of undergraduate students, better serve groups historically underrepresented in STEM fields, design graduate education for tomorrow’s STEM workforce, build new models for leveraging assets and expertise, and build and use evidence-based approaches. </p>

  <div class="views-field views-field-field-cag-overview-revision-id">    <span class="views-label views-label-field-cag-overview-revision-id">Overview: </span>    <div class="field-content"><p>The American people deserve a Government that is responsive to their needs. Citizens and businesses expect government services to be well-designed, efficient, and generally comparable to the services they receive from leading private sector organizations. Whether they call the IRS for an answer to a tax question or visit a Social Security Administration office to adjust their benefits, they should experience high-quality interactions with the Federal Government. Despite some important strides to improve customer service over the past fifteen years, too often many Federal Government services fail to meet the expectations of citizens and business, creating unnecessary hassle and cost for citizens, businesses, and the government itself.  The Federal Government must keep pace with the public’s expectations and transform its customer services – soliciting regular customer feedback, streamlining processes, and delivering consistent quality service across customer channels.</p>
<p>To that end, in April 2011 the President issued an<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/27/executive-order-streamlining-service-delivery-and-improving-customer-ser" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/27/executive-order-streamlining-service-delivery-and-improving-customer-ser">Executive Order</a> requiring each agency to develop a customer service plan that identified implementation steps for their customer service activities, including a "signature initiative" that uses technology to improve the customer experience. Agencies posted the plans on their Open Government websites in October 2011, and this goal will build on these plans to streamline and improve customer service delivery.</p>
<p>To build upon the progress being made by individual agencies, the Administration is taking action to deliver improved customer service across the Federal enterprise.  The Administration will:</p>
<ul><li><em>Streamline transactions.</em>  Too often the processes and procedures of government have been developed piecemeal over time, and have not been regularly reexamined to ensure they are designed with the user experience in mind.  The Administration will identify transactions with a high impact on a significant number of citizens and streamline processes, better meet customer needs, and use performance measures to improve services.  This includes areas such as TSA security screening, veterans’ pension and disability applications, income-based repayment of student loans, Social Security, and taxpayer assistance.</li>
<li><em>Develop standards for high impact services.</em>  Citizen expectations for government services are continually increasing, driven by improvements in technology and the high quality services provided by the private sector.  Government leaders have a responsibility to understand customer expectations and service needs, and continually evaluate and improve their effectiveness in meeting those needs.  To facilitate this, many government programs that provide direct services to the public can benefit from setting customer service standards, clearly communicating these standards to customers, and ensuring these standards are being met.  The Administration will identify best practices in setting customer service standards, such as placing an emphasis on first contact resolution, and facilitate implementation of these practices for high impact services.</li>
<li><em>Utilize technology to improve the customer experience.</em>  The Administration will work to deliver world-class customer services to citizens by making it faster and easier for individuals and businesses to complete transactions with government online.  Given the continually growing importance of online services, the Administration has established a separate Cross-Agency Priority Goal to focus resources and attention on this priority area. </li>

The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will also work with Agencies to incubate and scale new approaches to the design, development and delivery of top digital services and transactions.</li>
<li>Get the best companies working with government. The Administration’s efforts in this area will focus on streamlining the Federal IT acquisition process. Specific initiatives include creating more visibility of contracting opportunities for small, innovative companies; maximizing the use of available contracting flexibilities and best practices; and recommending administrative changes to the IT procurement processes.</li>
<li>Put the right processes and practices in place to drive outcomes and accountability. OMB will create and apply a new oversight and management process to highest impact IT investments in the Federal government. This process will include the best IT development and management approaches employed by the public and private sectors.  Lessons learned from this oversight process will be used to expand best practices across all agency IT investments.</li>

Today, proposals for contracts are lengthy, overly prescriptive, and laden with Government-specific requirements. There is also staggering duplication of contracts across Government and very little information sharing between agencies on pricing or other important contractual information. In order to fundamentally improve how taxpayer dollars are used in the Federal contracting space, the Administration is embarking on a comprehensive initiative to enhance collaboration and cooperation and drive greater innovation and improved performance through the implementation of Category Management.</p>
<p>This cross-agency priority (CAP) goal is focused on category management and will build on the progress made in the strategic sourcing initiative, leveraging the consolidated purchasing power of the Government to buy smarter and reduce duplication.  Category management is a new, more strategic approach that will enable the federal government to buy smarter and more like a single enterprise.  It involves identifying core areas of spend, developing heightened levels of expertise, leveraging shared best practices, providing streamlined solutions for acquisition, and managing supply and demand.  The objective is to increase efficiency and effectiveness while reducing costs and redundancies.  The first area of focus for category management is information technology and the CAP goal will support this initiative.  The objectives of the Category Management CAP goal will be expanded as the Category Management Leadership Council endorses other areas of focus.  The CAP Goal metrics can be found on the “supporting materials tabs” and progress updates will begin in the final Quarter of FY15.  </p>

<p>We need to commit to driving efficiencies by creating opportunities to leverage existing resources and pool the government’s buying power.  This involves building common standards for underlying support activities and systems and driving out redundancy in administrative service provision.  It means changing agency expectations and incentives for spending.  And it means rethinking the way that the government considers and funds long-term investments in the systems and infrastructure that support customer service delivery. </p>
<p>The Federal Government will leverage the Executive Councils to develop common standards and benchmarks to measure shared service utilization, performance, and cost. Mandate those standards and benchmarks for common administrative services. From these standards and benchmarks we will drive efficiencies and greater performance by: 1) increasing the capacity of the Federal Shared Service Providers (SSPs) at DOI, USDA, Treasury, HHS, DOT and DOD; and 2) requiring use of lower-cost, higher-performing Shared Services for all agencies and SSPs which cannot meet established targets. We will target the following areas for Shared Services (listed in order of priority): financial, HR, technology, and acquisition.</p>

<p>The Administration has made significant progress in improving the management of information resources to increase interoperability and openness. In executive order 13642 President Obama outlined a clear vision for “Making Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information” wherever possible and legally permissible. The subsequently released Open Data Policy (OMB memorandum M-13-13) directed agencies to effectively “manage the information as a strategic asset” throughout its lifecycle and make data open by default to the extent permitted by law, while ensuring strict controls to safeguard individual privacy, confidentiality, and national security. </p>
<p>As a direct result, Americans are getting better access to government information and services they need. Homeowners who are struggling to pay their mortgages now get prompt, clear responses because companies are competing based on open consumer financial product complaint data published by CFPB, and can stay in their homes. Similarly, patients can now comparison shop to see which hospitals have the best outcomes and best prices thanks to data published by Medicaid and HHS—including a new dataset that for the first time shows what hospitals charge for inpatient services associated with the 100 most common kinds of hospital stays, revealing huge variations in hospital charges across the country and even within metro areas.</p>
<p>To drive further impact and results, the Open Data CAP Goal will focus on a series of government-wide objectives, strategies and major metrics that facilitate and gauge the outcome-oriented and management improvement goals of Open Data.  Metrics will prioritize three channels of impact measurement: impact on economic value creation organizations, impact on existing public program outcomes, and impact on internal government efficiency.  </p>

Though changes to policy or law may ultimately be needed to address workforce and cultural challenges across government, we can and should take actions to maximize the impact of our workforce within the existing environment.  We propose to:</p>
<ul><li>Create a Culture of Excellence and Engagement to Enable Higher Performance.  We will foster a culture of excellence by using data-driven approaches to enhance management, performance, and innovation across the current Federal workforce.  Specifically, we will focus on employee engagement (measured by employee views about their leaders, supervisors, and work experience), as multiple evaluations have demonstrated a strong correlation between employee engagement and an organization’s productivity.  Agencies can now get access to this data for over 13,000 work-level units across the country (up from just a few hundred units four years ago).  This level of specificity in data will provide agency managers with actionable information to target areas where improvement is needed most and where there are management best practices that can provide a model for success.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul><li>Build a World-Class Federal Management Team Starting with the Senior Executive Service (SES). To ensure a first-class Federal workforce long-term, we will invest in our civil service leadership by taking administrative actions that result in a broader experience and skill base across the Federal Executive Corps.  This includes addressing the “pain points” in the hiring process and enhancing training and accountability over the terms of their service.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul><li>Enable Agencies to Hire the Best Talent from All Segments of Society.  We will collaborate with Federal stakeholders and labor groups to ensure a balanced strategic approach to improving hiring outcomes. In the short term, we will identify and address the erosion of the original flexibilities of Title 5.  In the long term, we will work closely with labor unions and use demonstration projects and/or legislation and regulatory changes to ensure that our hiring processes attract and retain America’s talent.  We will measure the success of this effort by assessing manager satisfaction with the quality of both applicants and their hires after six months on the job. </li>

                    <p>Agencies establish a variety of organizational goals to drive progress toward key outcomes for the American people. Long-term strategic goals articulate clear statements of what the agency wants to achieve to advance its mission and address relevant national problems, needs, challenges and opportunities. Strategic objectives define the outcome or management impact the agency is trying to achieve, and also include the agency's role. Each strategic objective is tracked through a suite of performance goals, indicators and other evidence.

                            <div class='thingtoshoworhide' style='display: none'><p>The Priority Goals define the areas of notable reform set by the Secretary that were developed as part of the Department of he Interior's FY 2011 - 2016 Strategic Plan.  The Department's Strategic Plan provides the frameowrk for the programs and activities that are performed by nine bureaus and multiple offices, and that takes place at 2,400 locations throughout the Nation.  The plan was developed over the course of 18 months, including extensive consultation to incorporate lessons learned and reflect a more integrated, simpler, and focused presentation, including expanded consultation with Indian tribes.  Congressional consultations started with the review of the framework proposed for the Strategic Plan at the start of the development process to gather any particular points to consider and include, with a review of the completed product prior to its release.  Additional consideration of the Priority Goals was also conducted with review of the budget materials that were provided to COngress by the Department and the Executive Office.</p>
<p>The Priority Goal for "Improved Oversight and Management of Oil and Gas Resources" is a component of the Department's efforts to address the deficiencies identified in the GAO High Risk report, which identified the areas for needed improvement including:</p>
ensuring data on production verification and royalties are consistent and reliable,
meeting goals for oil and gas verification inspections, and
ensuring that informal employee training is supported by formalized training courses offered on a consistent basis.
<p>Therefore consultations occur through GAO follow-up actions to ensure a coordinated interaction with Congress.</p>

<p>By September 30, 2015, the Department of the Interior will demonstrate maturing implementation of climate change adaptation as scored when carrying out strategies in its Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan.</p>
</p>
                                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p><strong>Problem or opportunity being addressed</strong></p>
<p>The Department has established policy emphasizing the importance of considering and analyzing potential climate change impacts when undertaking long-range planning exercises. Such plans must evaluate risks to and vulnerabilities in bureau operations and missions, and outline actions to manage these in the short- and long-term. The Department continues to develop, implement and update comprehensive plans to integrate consideration of climate change science and response strategies into operations to help make the nation’s communities, watersheds, and natural resources more resilient, and safeguard our cultural heritage.</p>
<p><strong>Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives</strong></p>
<p>The Secretary of the Interior has identified the effects of climate change as a major challenge   affecting missions across the Department, just as the President has identified in his Climate Change Action Plan Policy and Executive Order 13514 (October 5, 2009) and on “Preparing the United States for the Impacts of Climate Change” (November 1, 2013).   The Department’s Climate Change Adaptation Policy (523 DM 1) provides a set of principles and guidance to bureaus and offices for addressing climate change impacts on the Department’s mission, programs, operations and personnel. The policy also establishes roles and responsibilities for carrying out climate change adaptation principles.</p>
<p><strong>Key barriers and challenges </strong></p>
<p>Understanding, communicating, and responding to the diversity of impacts associated with climate change across the various landscapes of the United States is an ambitious undertaking.  Identifying similar terminology and means of measurement, engaging in collaborative communications with partners both within and outside DOI, obtaining adequate scientific understanding, and integrating various datasets and information sources are just some aspects of this undertaking that are already underway, and each of these activities is challenging.</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong></p>
<p>Climate Science Centers and Landscape Conservation Cooperatives are engaging Interior and other Federal agencies, local and State partners, and the public to craft practical, landscape-level strategies for managing climate-change impacts within the eight regions.  The Department is building the scientific and organizational infrastructure to work with partners in the development of adaptation tools and the coordination of climate-change responses at the landscape level.  We are partnering to develop state-of-the-art strategies to translate science into adaptive management and to develop robust ecological-forecasting models.</p>

<p>Responsibility for fiduciary trust oversight of Tribal lands and assets rests on several Departmental offices and programs.</p>
<ul><li>The <strong>Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians</strong> (OST) ensures sufficient resource dedication to manage Indian fiduciary assets, reform and improve trust-related processes and performance, and provide technical and economic assistance to Tribes.   Additionally, OST works with the programs described below in fulfilling fiduciary trust for Native American lands and assets.</li>
</ul><ul><li><strong>Probate Services</strong> ensures timely distribution of trust assets.  The Cobell litigation settlement created substantial growth in customer service requests for information on estate distribution of trust assets.</li>
</ul><ul><li><strong>Human Services</strong> and OST collaborate in operating the BIA Service Center to settle unresolved issues or concerns related to supervised trust accounts. BIA monitors trust accounts for up-to-date information, tracks supervised accounts requiring assessments, and quantifies completed assessments.   Additionally, BIA administers supervised Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts through an automated case management system that increases transparency and accountability of the assets in IIM accounts.</li>
</ul><ul><li>The <strong>Land Title and Records Office</strong> (LTRO) improves Native American ownership information and protects and preserves trust lands and resources through accurate, timely, accountable, and efficient processing of complete title ownership and encumbrance for all Federal Indian trust and restricted lands.    </li>
</ul><ul><li><strong>Real Estate Services</strong> conducts activities and processes transactions to protect, manage, develop, and utilize trust and restricted Federal Indian-owned lands.  This includes (I) conducting cadastral surveys to designate legal land boundaries, (II) acquisition and disposal (A&amp;D) of tribal lands, (III) leasing , permitting, and compliance for surface and sub-surface mineral and non-energy mineral development on tribal land, (IV) issuing rights-of-way on tribal lands, and (V) addressing unresolved Indian trust rights.</li>
</ul><ul><li>The<strong> Land Buy-Back Program for Tribal Nations </strong>was established to implement the land consolidation aspects of the Cobell Settlement Agreement.  As of October, 2015, purchase offers totaling more than $1.7 billion have been sent to approximately 66,500 individual landowners with fractional interests at 19 locations.  Of these offers, nearly $715 million have been accepted with almost 1.5 million equivalent acres purchased.</li>

<p>By September 30, 2015, reduce rates of repeat incarceration in three target tribal communities by 3% through a comprehensive “alternatives to incarceration” strategy that seeks to address underlying causes of repeat offenses, including substance abuse and social service needs through tribal and federal partnerships.</p>
</p>
                                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p><strong>Problem or opportunity being addressed</strong></p>
<p>The rate of recidivism nationally among Native Americans is estimated to be 33% higher than non-native populations, according to one Department of Justice report. Locally recidivism creates a huge drain on already overtaxed economies as well as overcrowded and dilapidated detention facilities.Individuals who repeat offend and are incarcerated, fill court dockets, and in many cases take primary bread winners out of the home.</p>
<p><strong>Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives</strong></p>
<p>This goal and associated activities will facilitate the ability of Interior to realize one of the President’s key objectives and a key priority for the Secretary of the Interior.  The effort is in direct support of the goal to re-establish the relationship with Indian Tribes and support the Strategic Goal to “Advance Government-to-Government Relationships with Indian Nations and Honor Commitments to Insular Areas.”</p>
<p><strong>Key barriers and challenges </strong></p>
<p>Conducting a focused program in highly geographically dispersed communities, with high levels of crime, disparate levels of staffing and training, and equipment have proven to be significant challenges.  Cooperation and support from Federal, State and tribal participants is a key requirement.  Tribal justice program commitment, differences and gaps in technology and program availability and participation is a key issue.  Funding increases for these program components has been aligned with the priority goal making this more feasible.</p>
<p>Other key challenges may include but not limited to:</p>
<ul><li>Record access of Tribal Correctional facilities</li>
<li>Availability of funding for components of the program that are not under Interior’s jurisdiction, e.g. detention facilities</li>
<li>Availability of substance abuse treatment programs – social program budgets, staffing and capacity have not kept pace with the increased law enforcement effort</li>
<li>Sentencing resources and alternative program availability.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong></p>
<p>The Department conducts consultation with tribal leaders and other stakeholders during the development of the budget and prior to the development and implementation of the Priority Goal on their respective reservations. This ensures a high level of understanding and commitment is received from all parties.</p>
<p>The Department has already begun to assist the Tribes in developing alternative to incarceration strategic plans based on the available resources in the community and or resources that stakeholders can provide to assist.</p>
<p>The Department assists the tribal programs with developing and coordinating stakeholder and community meetings throughout the initiative to discuss progress and any barriers or issues that may negatively affect meeting the goal.</p>

</p>
                                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p><strong>Problem or opportunity being addressed</strong></p>
<p>The inspection of high risk producing oil and gas cases is paramount to help ensure that hydrocarbon production on federally managed lands are properly accounted for and results in accurate royalty payments to the public and Indian owners of such minerals.Oil and gas production on federally supervised lands represent a significant part of the nation’s hydrocarbon production.Operating regulations at 43 CFR 3161.3 (a) require the BLM to inspect all leases which produce high volumes of oil or natural gas and those leases that have a history of non-compliance at least once a year.The high risk cases are determined by four risk factors: production rating; number of missing Oil and Gas Operations Reports (OGOR); non-compliance rating; and, last production inspection date rating.</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>This effort is a component of addressing the deficiencies identified in the GAO High Risk report, which identified the areas for needed improvement including:</div>
</div>
</div>
<ol><li>ensuring data on production verification and royalties are consistent and reliable,</li>
<li>meeting goals for oil and gas verification inspections, and</li>
<li>ensuring that informal employee training is supported by formalized training courses offered on a consistent basis.</li>
</ol><p><strong>Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives</strong></p>
<p>Achieving a high rate of inspecting high risk producing cases will advance the BLM’s mission by ensuring that oil and gas operations are conducted in compliance with lease terms, with the regulations in title 43 CFR 3161.3 (a), and all other applicable regulations.  The BLM is charged, in Section 101. (a) of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982, with procedures to ensure that each federal and Indian lease site which is producing or is expected to produce significant quantities of oil or gas in any year or which has a history of non-compliance be inspected at least once annually.</p>
<p><strong>Key barriers and challenges </strong></p>
<p>The Bureau is limited in its ability to meet the requirement of inspecting all high risk cases by the number of certified inspectors available to inspect these cases.  Competing priorities take time from these inspectors in completing high risk production inspections.  High priority drilling and abandonment inspections must be completed prior to high risk production inspections.  In addition the Bureau has historically had a high turnover of certified inspectors.</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong></p>
<p>The Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Department of the Interior Office of Inspector General (OIG) has pointed out the failure of the BLM to adequately ensure production of federal and Indian minerals.  The BLM answered the requests from both the GAO and OIG.  This Priority Goal was created to help address some of the identified concerns while providing a forum by which the Department can continue to track the progress toward addressing the other concerns identified by GAO.  The goal was developed in concert with the White House and released with the President’s FY 2013 Budget.</p>

<p>As manager of one-fifth of the nation’s landmass and 1.7 billion acres of the outer continental shelf, the U.S. Department of the Interior has the resources to help America produce more energy at home, thereby supporting a growing economy and job creation and reducing dependence on foreign oil and increasing sustainable practices with reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Secretary Sally Jewell has placed a priority on “Powering Our Future,” emphasizing the responsible development of conventional and renewable resources on our nation’s public lands and waters.</p>
<p>Onshore, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has identified 20.6 million acres of public land with wind energy potential in 11 western states, 30 million acres with solar energy potential in six southwestern states, and 111 million acres of public land in western states and Alaska with geothermal resource potential.  Offshore, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) manages the Outer Continental Shelf, 1.7 billion acres of federal-offshore lands with enormous wind-energy potential, and approved in 2011 the construction plan for Cape Wind Energy off the coast of Massachusetts.</p>
<p>In addition to the multiple renewable energy efforts on public lands, the Department of Interior is reducing energy consumption within its own buildings while also self-generating renewable energy at over 1,000 Interior sites nationwide, including locations such as visitor centers, wildlife refuges, recreation centers, and tribal facilities.  Developing such renewable energy resources responsibly could help support a growing economy and protect our national interests while reducing our dependence on foreign oil and climate-changing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p><strong>Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives</strong></p>
<p>As the means for advancing the Administration’s ‘all-of-the-above’ strategy to develop domestic energy resources, realizing one of the Secretary of the Interior’s key priorities in creating a new energy frontier and as reflected in Interior’s Strategic Plan’s mission area to “Powering Our Future and Responsible Use of the Nation’s Resources,” this goal continues to expand upon the efforts started with the initial FY 2010/2011 Priority Goal to, “Increase approved capacity authorized for renewable (solar, wind, and geothermal) energy resources on Department of the Interior managed lands, while ensuring full environmental review, by at least 9,000 megawatts through 2011.”  As part of securing America’s energy future, DOI is helping to move our nation toward a clean-energy economy. At Interior, this means changing the way we do business by opening our doors to responsible development of renewable energy on our public lands. This means using a ‘Smart from the Start’ approach that prioritizes and processes existing applications in a coordinated, focused manner with full environmental analysis and public review.  Efforts include facilitating environmentally appropriate renewable-energy projects involving solar, wind and waves, geothermal, and hydropower. These resources, developed in the right ways and the right places, will help curb our dependence on foreign oil, reduce our use of fossil fuels and promote new industries and jobs here in America.</p>
<p><strong>Key barriers and challenges </strong></p>
<p>Renewable energy projects, especially solar and wind, are complex.  The Department is committed to permitting renewable energy projects on public lands in an environmentally responsible manner.  As a result, proposed projects are sometimes rejected or reduced in size and scope to avoid or minimize impacts to tribal and cultural resources, threatened and endangered species and their habitat, or areas near or adjacent to lands designated by Congress, the President, or Secretary for the protection of sensitive viewsheds, resources, and values that could be adversely affected by development.  Additionally, renewable energy companies sometimes decide to scale down, modify timelines and develop their projects in phases, or otherwise modify or withdraw projects for reasons unrelated to the permitting process.</p>
<p>By tracking progress on a quarterly basis, Interior is aware of the emerging complex issues and challenges associated with the formulation of renewable energy projects that require time and resources to address—including for example, rerouting and modification of plans to avoid impacts to natural resources like sensitive avian and wildlife species and tribal concerns.  Further, while Interior agencies play a critical role in facilitating the siting and permitting of renewable energy projects on public lands, there are other factors that impact a potential project’s progress, including the project proponent’s ability to secure financing and to obtain power purchase agreements with electric utility companies.  Technology and transmission constraints, such as an applicant needing to upgrade a transmission line, can also impact the overall schedule.</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong></p>
<p>This goal includes a broad number of stakeholders within Interior and externally.  It is a continuation of a FY 2012-2013 goal that was developed by BLM in concert with the Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management.  Other Federal agencies including DOI, USDA, EPA, NOAA; Interior bureaus including FWS, NPS, USGS; as well as States, local entities, conservation groups, industry and others  are engaged to advance the Administration’s ‘all-of-the-above’ strategy to develop domestic energy resources and to achieve one of the Secretary of the Interior’s top priorities for “Powering Our Future.”</p>

                                                                                  <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>The Obama Administration’s coordinated strategy to develop all appropriate sources of renewable and conventional energy on U.S. public lands calls for development of onshore and offshore renewable energy under a ‘Smart from the Start’ approach that prioritizes and processes existing applications in a coordinated, focused manner with full environmental analysis and public review.</p>
<p>As manager of one-fifth of the nation’s landmass and 1.7 billion acres of the outer continental shelf, the U.S. Department of the Interior has the resources to help America produce more energy at home, thereby supporting a growing economy and job creation and reducing dependence on foreign oil and increasing sustainable practices with reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Secretary Sally Jewell has placed a priority on “Powering Our Future,” emphasizing the responsible development of conventional and renewable resources on our nation’s public lands and waters.</p>
<p>Onshore, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has identified 20.6 million acres of public land with wind energy potential in 11 western states, 30 million acres with solar energy potential in six southwestern states, and 111 million acres of public land in western states and Alaska with geothermal resource potential.  Offshore, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) manages the Outer Continental Shelf, 1.7 billion acres of federal-offshore lands with enormous wind-energy potential, and approved in 2011 the construction plan for Cape Wind Energy off the coast of Massachusetts.</p>
<p>In addition to the multiple renewable energy efforts on public lands, the Department of Interior is reducing energy consumption within its own buildings while also self-generating renewable energy at over 1,000 Interior sites nationwide, including locations such as visitor centers, wildlife refuges, recreation centers, and tribal facilities.  Developing such renewable energy resources responsibly could help support a growing economy and protect our national interests while reducing our dependence on foreign oil and climate-changing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p><strong>Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives</strong></p>
<p>As the means for advancing the Administration’s ‘all-of-the-above’ strategy to develop domestic energy resources, realizing one of the Secretary of the Interior’s key priorities in creating a new energy frontier and as reflected in Interior’s Strategic Plan’s mission area to “Powering Our Future and Responsible Use of the Nation’s Resources,” this goal continues to expand upon the efforts started with the initial FY 2010/2011 Priority Goal to, “Increase approved capacity authorized for renewable (solar, wind, and geothermal) energy resources on Department of the Interior managed lands, while ensuring full environmental review, by at least 9,000 megawatts through 2011.”  As part of securing America’s energy future, DOI is helping to move our nation toward a clean-energy economy. At Interior, this means changing the way we do business by opening our doors to responsible development of renewable energy on our public lands. This means using a ‘Smart from the Start’ approach that prioritizes and processes existing applications in a coordinated, focused manner with full environmental analysis and public review.  Efforts include facilitating environmentally appropriate renewable-energy projects involving solar, wind and waves, geothermal, and hydropower. These resources, developed in the right ways and the right places, will help curb our dependence on foreign oil, reduce our use of fossil fuels and promote new industries and jobs here in America.</p>
<p><strong>Key barriers and challenges </strong></p>
<p>Renewable energy projects, especially solar and wind, are complex.  The Department is committed to permitting renewable energy projects on public lands in an environmentally responsible manner.  As a result, proposed projects are sometimes rejected or reduced in size and scope to avoid or minimize impacts to tribal and cultural resources, threatened and endangered species and their habitat, or areas near or adjacent to lands designated by Congress, the President, or Secretary for the protection of sensitive viewsheds, resources, and values that could be adversely affected by development.  Additionally, renewable energy companies sometimes decide to scale down, modify timelines and develop their projects in phases, or otherwise modify or withdraw projects for reasons unrelated to the permitting process.</p>
<p>By tracking progress on a quarterly basis, Interior is aware of the emerging complex issues and challenges associated with the formulation of renewable energy projects that require time and resources to address—including for example, rerouting and modification of plans to avoid impacts to natural resources like sensitive avian and wildlife species and tribal concerns.  Further, while Interior agencies play a critical role in facilitating the siting and permitting of renewable energy projects on public lands, there are other factors that impact a potential project’s progress, including the project proponent’s ability to secure financing and to obtain power purchase agreements with electric utility companies.  Technology and transmission constraints, such as an applicant needing to upgrade a transmission line, can also impact the overall schedule.</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong></p>
<p>This goal includes a broad number of stakeholders within Interior and externally.  It is a continuation of a FY 2012-2013 goal that was developed by BLM in concert with the Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management.  Other Federal agencies including DOI, USDA, EPA, NOAA; Interior bureaus including FWS, NPS, USGS; as well as States, local entities, conservation groups, industry and others  are engaged to advance the Administration’s ‘all-of-the-above’ strategy to develop domestic energy resources and to achieve one of the Secretary of the Interior’s top priorities for “Powering Our Future.”</p>

</p>
                                                                                  <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p><strong>Problem or opportunity being addressed</strong></p>
<p>The inspection of high risk producing oil and gas cases is paramount to help ensure that hydrocarbon production on federally managed lands are properly accounted for and results in accurate royalty payments to the public and Indian owners of such minerals.Oil and gas production on federally supervised lands represent a significant part of the nation’s hydrocarbon production.Operating regulations at 43 CFR 3161.3 (a) require the BLM to inspect all leases which produce high volumes of oil or natural gas and those leases that have a history of non-compliance at least once a year.The high risk cases are determined by four risk factors: production rating; number of missing Oil and Gas Operations Reports (OGOR); non-compliance rating; and, last production inspection date rating.</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>This effort is a component of addressing the deficiencies identified in the GAO High Risk report, which identified the areas for needed improvement including:</div>
</div>
</div>
<ol><li>ensuring data on production verification and royalties are consistent and reliable,</li>
<li>meeting goals for oil and gas verification inspections, and</li>
<li>ensuring that informal employee training is supported by formalized training courses offered on a consistent basis.</li>
</ol><p><strong>Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives</strong></p>
<p>Achieving a high rate of inspecting high risk producing cases will advance the BLM’s mission by ensuring that oil and gas operations are conducted in compliance with lease terms, with the regulations in title 43 CFR 3161.3 (a), and all other applicable regulations.  The BLM is charged, in Section 101. (a) of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982, with procedures to ensure that each federal and Indian lease site which is producing or is expected to produce significant quantities of oil or gas in any year or which has a history of non-compliance be inspected at least once annually.</p>
<p><strong>Key barriers and challenges </strong></p>
<p>The Bureau is limited in its ability to meet the requirement of inspecting all high risk cases by the number of certified inspectors available to inspect these cases.  Competing priorities take time from these inspectors in completing high risk production inspections.  High priority drilling and abandonment inspections must be completed prior to high risk production inspections.  In addition the Bureau has historically had a high turnover of certified inspectors.</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong></p>
<p>The Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Department of the Interior Office of Inspector General (OIG) has pointed out the failure of the BLM to adequately ensure production of federal and Indian minerals.  The BLM answered the requests from both the GAO and OIG.  This Priority Goal was created to help address some of the identified concerns while providing a forum by which the Department can continue to track the progress toward addressing the other concerns identified by GAO.  The goal was developed in concert with the White House and released with the President’s FY 2013 Budget.</p>

<p>The Public Domain Forest Management program manages over 58 million acres of forests and woodlands mainly in the western states.  BLM forests and woodlands serve a variety of purposes and provide many important benefits, offering timber and other forest products and recreational opportunities that support local economies.  There resources serve as valuable wildlife habitat, and play an important role in carbon storage and clean water and air.  Using timber sales as a tool to restore and treat forests, the program focuses on ecosystem restoration and health, protection, and management for multiple objectives including biodiversity, conservation, and sustainable development for local communities.  The program also coordinates with the Wildland Fire management program to leverage funds for hazardous fuels reduction projects.</p>
<p>The Western Oregon Forest Management program includes all costs associated with management, maintenance, and enhancement of forests and woodlands on the public lands, including the Oregon and California (O&amp;C) Grant lands, the Coos Bay Wagon Road lands, and Public Domain land within western Oregon, except for activities directly related to reforestation and forest development. The program offers for sale timber and other forest products in such a way as to sustain a permanent source of timber supply while also maintaining forest health.</p>

<p>The future of the Country’s natural, cultural and historic heritage depends on the next generation of active stewards.  The Millennial generation, defined as individuals born in 1980 or later, is larger, more urban and diverse than any generation in our history.  Yet Millennials have grown up more disconnected from the natural world.  As Secretary Sally Jewell indicated,  “Engaging the millennial generation in service on public lands, welcoming them into the Department of the Interior, and so many other opportunities to have work within public lands management, is going to be a critical part of our future, if we care about these special places that help define us.”</p>
<p><strong>Secretary Sally Jewell, March 14, 2014 – Announcing the Next Generation Priority</strong>            <a href="http://www.doi.gov/youth/news/engaging-the-next-generation.cfm" target="_blank"><strong>http://www.doi.gov/youth/news/engaging-the-next-generation.cfm</strong></a></p>
<p>The underlying objective of Interior's Engaging the Next Generation priority is to establish meaningful and deep connections between young people from every background and every community to the great outdoors. Interior is investing millions of dollars in our <em>Engaging the Next Generation</em> priority to inspire millions of young people to play, learn, serve and work outdoors.  To that end, Interior has established a goal of providing 100,000 work and training opportunities over four years to individuals up to the age of 35.   In support of this long-term goal, the FY 2014-FY 2015 priority goal is being extended to include ages 15-35 in providing 40,000 work and training opportunity over the two year period, starting in FY 2015. </p>
<p>This priority goal complements Interior’s efforts to develop a 21<sup>st</sup> Century Workforce.  The Department benefits from a workforce that is passionate about the mission, dedicated to public service, and highly skilled and knowledgeable.  Across Interior, 40% of our permanent workforce will be eligible to retire within the next five years.   Providing a variety of work and training opportunities to students and recent graduates is critical to our succession planning. </p>
<p><strong>b.  Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives</strong></p>
<p>This priority goal supports Strategic Plan mission area 4, “Engaging the Next Generation” as well as efforts to create a 21<sup>st</sup> Century Workforce.  The priority goal aims to address reductions in work and training opportunities created by fiscal challenges in FY 2013 and builds upon the number of opportunities provided in FY 2010-FY 2012. </p>
<p>This priority goal for work and training opportunities builds upon other Engaging the Next Generation initiatives at DOI.  The Department’s goal of engaging youth in conservation includes programs to encourage the nation’s youth to play, learn, serve, and work in the great outdoors.  As the culmination of this four pronged approach, work and training opportunities for youth depend in great part on successful efforts to promote recreation on DOI-managed public lands, encourage the nation’s educators to bring our natural environment into classrooms, and cultivate a culture of service in support of conservation and natural resource management.</p>
<p><strong>c.  Key barriers and challenges </strong></p>
<p>Work and training opportunities, both directly by the Department and through partners, must occur within a specific time-frame for seasonal and temporary summer employment in order to secure commitments from participants.  If bureaus miss the window of opportunity during the limited time-frame, participants may seek employment opportunities elsewhere.  Additionally, with approximately one-third of DOI youth employment stemming from partnership agreements, budget uncertainty creates significant challenges to Bureaus’ ability to enter into partnership agreements, particularly for the peak hiring seasons when colleges are out of session.  These public/private partnership efforts help to leverage Federal dollars, in some cases by a 3 to 1 ratio, and assist the Department in increasing youth employment opportunities.</p>
<p>In FY 2013, fiscal and budgetary challenges significantly impacted the Department’s ability to fund work and training opportunities for youth.  Furthermore, the timing of the budgetary uncertainty, as well as the implementation of new models of youth employment across the government, via the Pathways program, made timely hiring of youth for those available positions difficult.  Should current budgetary and fiscal trends continue, the Department expects these to pose a barrier to fulfillment of this goal.</p>
<p><strong>d.  Stakeholder Engagement</strong></p>
<p>Key partners include the over 150 members of the Corps Network that engage 30,000 young people in all 50 States in addition to the work of the Public Lands Service Coalition.  These public/private partnership efforts help to leverage Federal dollars in some cases 3 to 1 and have assisted the Departments in increasing youth employment opportunities.  In addition, there are many non-profit, corporate, state, local and tribal entities that partner with the Department to enhance volunteer service opportunities and youth employment in the great outdoors. It will continue to be important to engage these stakeholders as we implement related recommendations for the broader youth stewardship and engagement priority goal.</p>

<p>The Nation faces an increasing set of water resource challenges: aging water-related infrastructure, rapid population growth, depletion of groundwater resources, and climate variability and change. Shortages and water use conflicts have become more commonplace in many areas of the US, even in "normal" years. Water issues and challenges are especially increasing in the West, due to prolonged drought and population shift.Traditional water management approaches, by themselves, no longer meet today's need.Federal leadership is critical to widespread acceptance and implementation of effective conservation and recycling techniques.</p>
<p><strong>Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives</strong></p>
<p>As the means for realizing one of the Secretary of the Interior’s key priorities for tackling the water challenges in the west, this goal will add to the achievements reflected in the Strategic Plan under the mission area to “Sustainably Manage Energy, Water, and Natural Resources.</p>
<p>Reclamation works collaboratively with non-federal, state, local and tribal governments, water districts, and other entities, on a cost-shared basis to implement projects that improve water management and result in water conservation in the 17 Western states.  This includes projects to line unlined canals, install remote technology to allow for more accurate control over water deliveries, install new water measurement devices, and other projects that allow water users to decrease water diversions by increasing efficiency and operational flexibility.  By conserving water that can be made available for other uses, these projects contribute to the goal by increasing the available water supply and contribute to Reclamation’s broader objective of achieving a more sustainable water supply.</p>
<p>A sustainable water supply is critical to address current and future water shortages; degraded water quality; increased demands for water from growing populations and energy needs; amplified recognition of environmental water requirements; the potential for decreased water supply availability due to drought, climate change, or decreased storage and delivery capacity; and water inequity for Indian tribes and rural communities disadvantaged by financial need or geographic isolation.  Reclamation believes that water conservation, use of water markets, and improved efficiency are crucial elements of any plan to address western water issues. With leveraged water sustainability grants, an important step will be taken towards increasing conservation for a more efficient use of water in the West.</p>
<p><strong>Key barriers and challenges </strong></p>
<p>The primary challenges and risks that influence achievement of the Priority Goal include:</p>
<ul><li>The availability of data needed to measure water conserved.</li>
<li>Water savings are heavily dependent upon applications submitted by project sponsors.</li>
<li>State Water Laws (e.g., disincentives to water conservation).</li>
<li>Ability to complete environmental compliance in a reasonable timeframe and cost.</li>
<li>Local cost-shares (e.g., inability to meet cost-share requirements identified by respective program).</li>
</ul><p><strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong></p>
<p>This goal is a continuation of the FY 2012-2013 goal that was developed by the Reclamation Commissioner and the Assistant Secretary Water and Science as a means for helping achieve one of the Secretary of the Interior’s top priorities in addressing the water challenges facing the western U.S.</p>
<p>Programs that contribute to the Priority Goal for Water Conservation provide funding for improvements proposed, planned, and carried out by non-Federal entities with Reclamation’s assistance.Collaboration is therefore a crucial aspect of efforts to achieve this Priority Goal. Reclamation also incorporates stakeholder feedback into its conservation efforts by engaging stakeholders during program formulation and significant program revisions.For example, Reclamation made draft funding criteria for the Title XVI Program available for public review and comment in 2010 and incorporated feedback into final criteria.Similarly, the WaterSMART Strategic Implementation Plan was published in the Federal Register in March 2011 and comments were incorporated into the final document.Reclamation also routinely works with its partners at the State and local level through public outreach meetings, scoping committees, and through reporting and program oversight.</p>

Competition for finite water supplies is increasing as a result of population growth, agricultural demands, and water for environmental needs.  An increased emphasis on domestic energy development will place additional pressure on limited water supplies, as significant amounts of water may be required for unconventional and renewable energy development.</p>
<p>Impacts of climate change, as evidenced by increases in temperature, decreases in precipitation and snowpack, extended droughts, and depleted aquifers and stream flow in several Reclamation river basins are reducing water supplies.   Water is vital for the environment and the economies of rural and urban communities in the west.  The Department will “increase” water supplies through BOR’s Priority Goal conservation programs.</p>

Highly accurate elevation maps and data, for example, are essential for hazards mitigation, conservation, infrastructure development, national security, coastal shoreline erosion, and many other applications. The benefits apply to flood risk management, agriculture and precision farming, water supply, homeland security, renewable energy, aviation safety, and other activities.  Specific examples demonstrating the benefits of geospatial information include:  emergency responders for search and rescue missions, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for preliminary damage assessments and rebuilding efforts from natural disasters, and entrepreneurial companies for mobile device applications.  Although US topographic maps are updated on a 3-year cycle, all geospatial layers regardless of vintage are archived and continue to provide value to the public for historical trends.  Hawaii and Puerto Rico topographic maps have also recently been revised.</p>

<p>By September 30, 2017, increase approved capacity authorized for renewable (solar, wind, geothermal, and hydropower) energy resources affecting Department of the Interior managed lands, while ensuring full environmental review, to at least 16,600 Megawatts (since the end of FY 2009).</p>
</p>
                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p><strong>Problem or opportunity being addressed</strong></p>
<p>As manager of one-fifth of the nation’s landmass and 1.7 billion acres of the outer continental shelf, the Department of the Interior plays a major role in implementing the Obama Administration’s “Smart from the Start” strategy to develop all appropriate sources of renewable and conventional energy on U.S. public lands.  Responsible development of conventional and renewable resources on Interior managed lands and waters involve processing applications in a focused manner with full environmental analysis and public review. By advancing renewable energy, Interior helps America produce more energy at home, reducing our dependency on foreign oil while supporting a growing economy, creating jobs, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>Onshore, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has identified 20.6 million acres of public land with wind energy potential in 11 western states, 30 million acres with solar energy potential in six southwestern states, and 111 million acres of public land in western states and Alaska with geothermal resource potential.  Offshore, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) manages the Outer Continental Shelf, 1.7 billion acres of federal-offshore lands with enormous wind-energy potential.</p>
<p>In addition, Interior reduces energy consumption within its own buildings at over 1,000 Interior sites nationwide ranging from visitor centers to wildlife refuges and tribal facilities, and increasingly self-generates energy by installing rooftop solar panels at Interior owned sites as appropriate. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives</strong></p>
<p>This goal ties directly to Mission Area 3, “Powering Our Future and Responsible Use of the Nation’s Resources,” of the Department of the Interior’s FY 2014-2018 Strategic Plan.  The priority goal helps Interior meet Goal 1, “Secure America’s Energy Resources,” through responsible development of renewable energy on our public lands by facilitating environmentally appropriate solar, wind and wave, geothermal, and hydropower projects in the right ways and right locations.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Key barriers and challenges </strong></p>
<p>Permitting in an environmentally responsible manner sometimes results in changes to applicants’ project proposals.  For example, proposed projects may be rejected or reduced in size and scope to avoid or minimize impacts to tribal and cultural resources, threatened and endangered species and their habitat, viewsheds, and other areas designated for protection by Congress, the President, or the Secretary of the Interior.   Additionally, renewable energy companies themselves sometimes scale down, modify timelines, develop projects in phases, or otherwise modify or withdraw projects for reasons unrelated to Interior’s permitting process.  By tracking progress on a quarterly basis, Interior monitors emerging issues and challenges associated with renewable energy projects.  In recent years, private companies’ applications for renewable energy projects on Interior lands have declined due to difficulties in securing financing and obtaining power purchase agreements with electric utility companies.  Additionally, technology and transmission constraints, such as an applicant needing to upgrade a transmission line, impact the number of renewal energy applications and approvals.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong></p>
<p>BLM developed the goal in conjunction with the Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management as well as other Federal agencies including DOD, USDA, EPA, NOAA; Interior bureaus including BIA, FWS, NPS, USGS; and States, local entities, conservation groups, industry and others engaged in advancing the Administration’s ‘all-of-the-above’ strategy to develop domestic energy resources and to achieve one of the Secretary of the Interior’s top priorities for “Powering Our Future.”  Additional information is available via <a href="http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/energy/renewable_energy.html">http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/energy/renewable_energy.html</a>.  </p>

<p>By September 30, 2017, the Department of the Interior will facilitate the availability of water supplies employing conservation, efficiency, and technology in the western United States through Bureau of Reclamation water conservation programs to 1,100,000 acre-feet cumulatively since the end of FY2009.</p>
</p>
                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p><strong>Problem or opportunity being addressed</strong></p>
<p>The Nation faces an increasing set of water resource challenges: aging water-related infrastructure, rapid population growth, depletion of groundwater resources, and climate variability and change. Shortages and water use conflicts have become more commonplace in many areas of the US, even in "normal" years. Water issues and challenges are especially increasing in the West due to prolonged drought and population shift.  A sustainable water supply is critical to address current and future water shortages, degraded water quality, increased demands for water and energy from growing populations, recognition of environmental water requirements, and water inequity for Indian tribes and rural communities disadvantaged by financial need or geographic isolation.   Traditional water management approaches, by themselves, no longer meet today's needs.  Federal leadership is critical to widespread acceptance and implementation of effective conservation and recycling techniques. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives</strong></p>
<p>This goal contributes to Mission Area 5, “Ensuring Healthy Watersheds and Sustainable, Secure Water Supplies,” of the Department of the Interior’s FY 2014-2018 Strategic Plan.  This latest version of the Priority Goal builds upon efforts started with the initial FY 2010/2011 Priority Goal to “Enable capability to increase available water supply for agricultural, municipal, industrial, and environmental uses in the western United States up to 350,000 acre-feet (estimated amount) by 2012 through the bureau’s various conservation-related programs, such as water reuse and recycling (Title XVI) and WaterSMART Grants.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Key barriers and challenges </strong></p>
<p>Measuring water conservation can be complex. The primary challenges and risks that influence achievement of the Priority Goal include:</p>
<ul><li>The availability of water measurement data;  </li>
<li>The number and scope of the projects proposed from year-to-year;</li>
<li>State water laws (e.g., disincentives to water conservation);</li>
<li>The ability to complete environmental compliance in a reasonable timeframe and cost;</li>
<li>Local cost-shares (e.g., inability to meet cost-share requirements identified by respective program).</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong></p>
<p>Reclamation works collaboratively with non-federal, state, local and tribal governments, water districts, and other entities on a cost-shared basis to implement water management and conservation projects in the 17 Western states. Reclamation incorporates stakeholder feedback into its conservation efforts by engaging stakeholders during program formulation and significant program revisions.  For example, based on applicant feedback, Reclamation revised the Title XVI funding opportunity to make it easier for applicants to request funding for ongoing work without having to break it into project phases. Similarly, Reclamation published the WaterSMART Strategic Implementation Plan in the Federal Register in March 2011 (<a href="http://www.usbr.gov/watersmart/docs/FedRegister_WaterSMART_Implementation_plan_FINAL.PDF">http://www.usbr.gov/watersmart/docs/FedRegister_WaterSMART_Implementation_plan_FINAL.PDF</a>) and incorporated comments into the final document.  Reclamation also routinely works with its partners at the State and local level through public outreach meetings, scoping committees, and through reporting and program oversight. </p>

<p>By September 30, 2017, reduce rates of repeat incarceration in five target tribal communities by 3% through a comprehensive “alternatives to incarceration” strategy that seeks to address underlying causes of repeat offenses, including substance abuse and social service needs, through tribal and federal partnerships.</p>
</p>
                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p><strong>Problem or opportunity being addressed</strong></p>
<p>The rate of recidivism nationally among Native Americans, an estimated 33% higher than non-native populations, creates a huge drain on the already overtaxed local Native economies: overcrowding at dilapidated detention centers, court dockets overwhelmed with cases, and, in many instances, loss of family primary bread winners.</p>
<p>This priority goal seeks to reduce recidivism by addressing root causes and by implementing alternatives to incarceration.  In terms of addressing underlying causes of re-arrest, BIA focuses resources on drug and alcohol abuse treatment and prevention programs, including addressing pre-disposing factors such as safety in the home and community; emotional, psychological, and physical poverty; and grief from loss of family and culture.  BIA coordinates social service needs of the target population, including mental health, education, employment, and family issues with the goal of reducing re-offenses.  In terms of alternatives to incarceration, BIA uses, as appropriate, probation, courts specific to substance abuse cases, and traditional cultural courts including healing to wellness courts that apply solutions-focused sentencing options and talking circles for truant juveniles.</p>
<p>This priority goal focuses on reducing repeat incarceration in five tribal communities.  Three communities, Duck Valley, Red Lake, and Ute Mountain, carry over from the FY 2014-15 priority goal.  For FY 2016-17, two additional communities will be identified and included.  Communities are chosen based on existing infrastructure and services, and the potential for enhancing these services/infrastructure, as well as tribal willingness to participate.  During the 2014-15 goal period, the first year involved putting into place the services, infrastructure, and activities at the pilot locations.  Actual measurement began in FY 2015, during which there were 81 repeat offenders among the 150 habitual offenders initially identified in FY 2013 at the three tribal communities; a reduction of 69 in the number of repeat offenders .  Given the length of time required to address the causes of repeat offenses, the FY 2016-17 results, combined with those of FY 2015, will give the Department a more realistic, multi-year picture of these recidivism reduction efforts.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives</strong></p>
<p>The recidivism reduction effort ties directly to Mission Area 2, “Strengthening Tribal Nations and Insular Communities,” in the Department of the Interior’s FY 2014-2018 Strategic Plan as well as Administration initiatives to improve the quality of life in tribal and native communities. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Key barriers and challenges </strong></p>
<p>While pursuing the prior FY 2010-2013 Priority Goal on reducing violent crime, BIA realized that reducing the number of repeat offenses could have a significant effect on the crime rate.  Techniques used in other cities that direct attention and services to reducing repeat offenses were considered for application in tribal communities.  Duck Valley, Red Lake and Ute Mountain, three very geographically dispersed communities, experience high levels of crime, disparate levels of staffing and training, equipment shortages, and significant differences and gaps in technology.  Additionally, reducing recidivism requires negotiating commitments with the Justice Department’s Tribal justice program and internal BIA programs.  Successful reduction in repeat incarcerations also requires cooperation and support from federal, state and tribal participants. </p>
<p>Other key challenges may include:</p>
<ul><li>Access to tribal correctional facilities records;</li>
<li>Availability of funding for components of the program not under Interior’s jurisdiction, e.g. detention facilities;</li>
<li>Availability of substance abuse treatment programs – social program budgets, staffing, and capacity have not kept pace with the increased law enforcement effort;</li>
<li>Sentencing resources and alternative program availability; and</li>
<li>Other environmental, social, and economic factors.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong></p>
<p>This priority goal and the implementation plan included consultation with tribal leaders of the participating reservations to ensure a high level of understanding and commitment for the goal.  Developing alternatives to incarceration requires ongoing coordination with, and assistance from, multiple entities within the tribal community to confront issues such as substance abuse, domestic violence, and worker training that can impact recidivism rates.  Interior regularly meets with and assists tribal programs to discuss progress and any barriers or issues that may negatively affect meeting the goal.</p>

<p>Interior established policy emphasizing the importance of considering and analyzing potential climate change impacts in long-range planning exercises. These plans evaluate risks to and vulnerabilities in bureau operations and missions, and outline actions to manage these in the short- and long-term. Interior continues to develop, implement and update comprehensive plans to integrate consideration of climate change science and response strategies to make the nation’s communities, watersheds, and natural resources more resilient, and safeguard our cultural heritage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives</strong></p>
<p>The Secretary of the Interior identified the effects of climate change as a challenge affecting missions across Interior, just as the President identified in his Climate Change Action Plan Policy and Executive Order 13514 (October 5, 2009) and “Preparing the United States for the Impacts of Climate Change” (November 1, 2013).   (<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/climate-change">https://www.whitehouse.gov/climate-change</a>) Interior has developed Climate Change resilience policies and strategies providing principles and guidance to bureaus and offices for addressing climate change impacts on Interior’s mission, programs, operations and personnel. (See <a href="https://www.doi.gov/climate">https://www.doi.gov/climate</a>).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Key barriers and challenges </strong></p>
<p>Understanding, communicating, and responding to the diversity of impacts associated with climate change across the various landscapes of the United States is an ambitious undertaking.  Identifying similar terminology and means of measurement, engaging in collaborative communications with partners both within and outside Interior, obtaining adequate scientific understanding, and integrating various datasets and information sources are just some aspects of this effort that are already underway, and each of these activities is challenging. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong></p>
<p>Climate Science Centers and Landscape Conservation Cooperatives engage Interior and other Federal agencies, local and State partners, and the public to design practical, landscape-level strategies for managing climate-change impacts.  Interior is building the scientific and organizational infrastructure to work with partners to develop adaptation tools and coordinate climate-change responses at the landscape level.  Interior is partnering to develop state-of-the-art strategies to translate science into adaptive management and to develop robust ecological-forecasting models.  </p>

<p>By September 30, 2017, the Department of the Interior will provide 100,000 work and training opportunities over four fiscal years (FY 2014 through FY 2017) for individuals age 15 to 35 to support Interior’s mission.</p>
</p>
                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p><strong>Problem or opportunity being addressed</strong></p>
<p>The future of the Nation’s natural, cultural and historic heritage depends on the next generation of active stewards.  The Millennial generation, defined as individuals born in 1980 or later, is larger, more urban and diverse than any generation in our history.  Yet Millennials have grown up more disconnected from the natural world.  As Secretary Sally Jewell has said, “Engaging the Millennial generation in service on public lands, welcoming them into the Department of the Interior, and so many other opportunities to have work within public lands management, is going to be a critical part of our future, if we care about these special places that help define us.”</p>
<p><strong>Secretary Sally Jewell, March 14, 2014 – Announcing the Next Generation Priority</strong>            <a href="http://www.doi.gov/youth/news/engaging-the-next-generation.cfm" target="_blank"><strong>http://www.doi.gov/youth/news/engaging-the-next-generation.cfm</strong></a></p>
<p>Interior's Engaging the Next Generation priority goal seeks to establish meaningful and deep connections between young people from every background and every community to the great outdoors.  Interior is working to inspire millions of young people to play, learn, serve and work outdoors, and aims to provide 100,000 work and training opportunities over four years to individuals up to the age of 35.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives</strong></p>
<p>This priority goal supports Mission Area 4, “Engaging the Next Generation,” of the Department of the Interior’s FY 2014-2018 Strategic Plan, as well as efforts to create a 21<sup>st</sup> Century Workforce.  Interior benefits from a workforce that is passionate about the mission, dedicated to public service, and highly skilled and knowledgeable.  Across Interior, 40% of our permanent workforce will be eligible to retire within the next five years.  As part of our succession planning, a variety of work and training opportunities to next generation students and recent graduates are provided.  Interior’s goal of engaging youth in conservation includes programs to encourage the nation’s youth to play, learn, serve, and work in the great outdoors. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Key barriers and challenges </strong></p>
<p>By and through its partners, Interior must provide work and training opportunities within a specific time-frame for seasonal and temporary summer employment.  If bureaus miss the window of opportunity during the limited time-frame, participants may seek employment opportunities elsewhere.  Additionally, with approximately one-third of Interior youth employment stemming from partnership agreements, our ability to enter into partnership agreements is essential, particularly for the peak hiring seasons when colleges are out of session.  These public/private partnership efforts help to leverage Federal dollars, in some cases by a 3 to 1 ratio, and assist Interior in increasing youth employment opportunities. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong></p>
<p>Interior partners with the Corps Network, which engages 30,000 young people in all 50 States, in addition to the Public Lands Service Coalition.  Also, Interior partners with non-profit, corporate, state, local and tribal entities to enhance volunteer service opportunities and youth employment in the great outdoors.  Interior will continue to engage these stakeholders in implementing broader youth stewardship and engagement. </p>

<p>By September 30, 2017, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) will complete 100 percent of the inspections for federal and Indian potential high-risk oil and gas production cases annually to better ensure accountability and safety.</p>
</p>
                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p><strong>Problem or opportunity being addressed</strong></p>
<p>Oil and gas production on Interior’s managed lands represents a significant part of the nation’s hydrocarbon production.  In February 2011, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) listed Interior’s management of Federal oil and gas on GAO’s High-Risk List for deficiencies in its oversight of three broad areas:</p>
<ol><li>Revenue Collection: (a) whether Interior is collecting a “fair return”; (b) whether Interior is consistently meeting its target for production verification inspections; and (c) whether Interior has sufficient capacity to ensure that it is collecting reliable and consistent data on the production and sale of oil and gas from Federal lands and waters. </li>
<li>Human Capital: Interior’s ability to adequately address persistent problems in hiring, training, and retaining sufficient staff for oversight and management of oil and gas operations on Federal lands and waters. </li>
<li>Reorganization: whether Interior has the capacity to undertake the broad reorganization of its offshore oil and gas management and revenue collection functions while still providing reasonable assurance that billions of dollars in revenue are properly assessed and collected as well as managing oil and gas exploration and production on Federal lands and waters. In February 2013, GAO reported Interior’s completion of addressing this deficiency.</li>
</ol><p>Conducting annual inspections of high risk oil and gas cases helps ensure accurate production reporting and correct royalty payments, as part of addressing the recommendations specified in the GAO High Risk Listing.  High risk case identification focuses on the following seven risk factors, four generated by the BLM and three derived from the Office of Natural Resources Revenue’s (ONRR) risk model: </p>
<ul><li>BLM : (1) production rating; (2) number of missing Oil and Gas Operations Reports (OGOR); (3) non-compliance rating; and (4) date of last production inspection.</li>
<li>ONRR: (1) OGOR reporting error rating; (2) production variance rating; and (3) audit findings rating.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong>Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives</strong></p>
<p>In addition to assisting with addressing the revenue collection deficiency, this priority goal ties directly to Mission Area 3, Powering Our Future and Responsible Use of the Nation’s Resources, in the Department of the Interior’s FY 2014-2018 Strategic Plan.  Additionally, inspecting high risk producing cases ensures compliance of oil and gas operations with lease terms, regulations in title 43 CFR 3161.3 (a), and other applicable regulations.  Section 101(a) of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982 requires, at a minimum, annual inspections of those federal and Indian lease sites producing, or expected to produce, significant quantities of oil or gas or for which a history of non-compliance exists.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Key barriers and challenges </strong></p>
<p>The number of certified inspectors limits the Department’s ability to meet annual high risk cases inspection requirements.  Historically, high turnover of certified Interior inspectors resulted from competing private sector companies’ hiring efforts.  Recent oil price drops, however, seem to be slowing this trend.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong></p>
<p>Interior developed this goal in conjunction with the White House/OMB and oil and gas production recommendations in response to GAO and the Office of the Inspector General.</p>

<p>By September 30, 2017, the Department of the Interior (through the Fish &amp; Wildlife Service) will double the acres of restored or enhanced habitat for Monarch butterflies and other pollinators. (Doubling the number of acres restored or enhanced for Monarch butterflies and other pollinators by September 30, 2017 will result in a total of 320,000 acres of agency land, private land, and state land restored or enhanced.)</p>
</p>
                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p><strong>Problem or opportunity being addressed</strong></p>
<p>This Agency Priority Goal (APG) is part of Interior’s efforts to support and implement the <em>National Strategy to Promote the Health of Honey Bees and Other Pollinators</em> (Strategy) released on May 19, 2015, by the White House Pollinator Health Task Force (Task Force).  The Strategy documents current and planned Federal actions to achieve three longer-term overarching goals:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Honey Bees: </strong>Reduce honey bee colony losses during winter within 10 years.</li>
<li><strong>Monarch Butterflies: </strong>Increase the Eastern population of the monarch butterfly by 2020.</li>
<li><strong>Pollinator Habitat Acreage: </strong>Restore or enhance land for pollinators over the next 5 years through Federal actions and public/private partnerships.</li>
</ul><p>The Strategy addresses four themes:</p>
<ol><li>conducting research to understand, prevent, and recover from pollinator losses;</li>
<li>expanding public education programs and outreach;</li>
<li>increasing and improving pollinator habitat; and</li>
<li>developing public-private partnerships across all these activities.</li>
</ol><p>The Strategy consists of a Pollinator Research Action Plan (Plan), and plans for outreach and education; habitat enhancement and increased acreage; and public-private partnerships.  The Task Force will modify and adjust the Strategy to reflect evolving science. This will ensure that Federal agencies use resources effectively to improve pollinator habitat and health. The President directed representatives from each of the departments and agencies responsible for various elements of the plan to report regularly to the Task Force.</p>
<p>Interior’s proposed FY2016/2017 priority goal is one portion of the Government-wide response to the Strategy and complements other agencies’ efforts (as both part of proposed APGs, as well as other Task Force implementation actions) without being duplicative. </p>
<ul><li>The monarch butterfly population is in crisis, having declined by more than 90 percent from its peak in the late 1990’s to the lowest population count on record during the winter of 2013-2014.  The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) leads the federal government’s efforts to guide actions for monarch conservation, which serves as a flagship effort for broader pollinator conservation work. Interior’s APG on Monarchs and Other Pollinators directly addresses two of the three Task Force overarching goals (on Monarch Butterflies and Pollinator Habitat) as well as addressing public education and outreach and public-private partnerships. </li>
</ul><ul><li>The other agencies with APGs related to pollinators also address multiple but not identical facets of the <em>National Strategy to Promote the Health of Honey Bees and Other Pollinators</em>.
<ul><li>The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) APG focuses on habitat restoration to assist honey bees and other pollinators (not specifically Monarchs).  This effort directly addresses the goal for honey bees while also addressing pollinator habitat in general. </li>
<li>The Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) APG addresses assessment of pesticides, other commercially available chemicals, and the risks those may pose to honey bees and other pollinators.  This goal also addresses larger issues affecting all pollinators and is complementary to all other agency efforts since it uses EPA’s expertise in risk evaluation of the use of chemicals in the environment.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong>Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives</strong></p>
<p>This priority goal supports Goal 1, “Protect America’s Landscapes,” in Mission Area 1 of the Department of the Interior’s FY 2014-2018 Strategic Plan. The strategies employed in this goal are: 1) Improve land and water health by managing the wetlands, uplands, and riparian areas that comprise our national parks, wildlife refuges, and BLM lands; and 2) Sustain fish, wildlife, and plant species by protecting and recovering the Nation’s fish and wildlife in cooperation with partners, including states.  The state of Monarchs reflects the health of the American landscape and its pollinators. Monarch population declines are symptomatic of environmental problems that also pose risks to food production; the spectacular natural places that help define our national identity, and our own health. Conserving and connecting habitat for monarchs will benefit many other plants and animals, including critical insect pollinators, as well as future generations of Americans.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Key barriers and challenges </strong></p>
<p>North American monarch butterflies are in trouble. Threats, including loss of milkweed habitat needed to lay their eggs and for their caterpillars to eat, are having a devastating impact on monarch populations and the migration phenomenon.  Much of the habitat that Monarchs and other pollinators utilize is on private lands, so it is crucial to have a strong set of partners who can reach out and work with private landowners to create sufficient habitat to protect and sustain healthy populations of Monarchs and other pollinators.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong></p>
<p>The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the National Wildlife Federation (NWF) and the Fish and Wildlife Service serves as a catalyst for national collaboration on monarch conservation, particularly in planting native milkweed and nectar plants - the primary food sources in breeding and migration habitats for the butterfly.  One of the MOU goals is to stimulate efforts to work together — individuals, communities, farmers, land managers, and local, state, and federal agencies — to ensure that every American child has a chance to experience amazing Monarchs in their backyards. Stakeholder engagement plans address the growing threats affecting so much of America’s treasured wildlife — habitat loss, pesticide overuse and climate change — to preserve Monarchs and America’s rich wildlife legacy. The NWF and its state affiliates will engage other key partners on the front lines of action. The USDA agencies implementing the conservation provisions of the 2014 Farm Bill will play a key role in helping engage agricultural producers in monarch conservation efforts.   </p>
<p>The National Fish and Wildlife Federation’s (NFWF) new Monarch Conservation Fund provides the first dedicated source of funding for projects working to conserve monarchs. From California to the Corn Belt, the FWS will fund numerous conservation projects totaling $2 million in 2015 to restore and enhance more than 200,000 acres of habitat for Monarchs while also supporting over 750 schoolyard habitats and pollinator gardens. Many of the projects will focus on the monarch flyway anchored around the I-35 corridor from Texas to Minnesota - areas that provide important spring and summer breeding habitats for the eastern population.</p>

                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p><strong>Problem or opportunity being addressed</strong></p>
<p>The 183 federally-funded Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) schools, educating more than 48,000 students on 63 reservations in 23 states, have a graduation rate of 53 percent compared to a national average of 80 percent.<a href="showcompare.html#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Removing barriers to the success of Native American youth includes improving Indian education.  Low rates of educational attainment perpetuate a cycle of limited opportunity for higher education or economic success.  Tribal communities can best identify barriers and opportunities for Indian education and design effective, culturally-relevant strategies for operating tribal schools that improve outcomes for their students.  Tribal communities need an educated citizenry to lead their governments, develop reservation economies, contribute to the social well-being of the community, and sustain Indian cultures.<a href="showcompare.html#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives</strong></p>
<p>This priority goal ties directly to Mission Area 2, “Strengthening Tribal Nations and Insular Communities,” of the Department of the Interior’s FY 2014-2018 Strategic Plan.  Additionally, improving graduation rates and giving tribes more control over educational curricula supports Administration initiatives to improve the quality of life in tribal and native communities. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Key barriers and challenges </strong></p>
<p>Educational achievement can also be affected by conditions in the community including its economy, available nutrition, wellness, mental health, substance abuse, family life, exposure to bullying and violence, housing shortages, etc.  As such, the education provided by BIE-funded schools may be only one of several factors impacting graduation rates. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong></p>
<p>BIE engages with tribal education departments and tribal colleges to help build the capacity and needs of schools.</p>
<p>In education, as in other areas of Federal Indian services, the Administration recognizes that successful Indian education involves tribal management of their schools. Today, tribes operate more than 2/3 of BIE funded schools, with BIE directly operating the remaining schools.  Interior comprehensively reviewed BIE operations for achieving improvements in Indian education, as described in “Findings &amp; Recommendations” prepared by the Indian Education Study Group (see <a href="http://www.bie.edu/NewsEvents/StudyGroup/index.htm">http://www.bie.edu/NewsEvents/StudyGroup/index.htm</a> and <a href="http://www.doi.gov/news/upload/Study-Group-Blueprint-DOI-FINAL.pdf">http://www.doi.gov/news/upload/Study-Group-Blueprint-DOI-FINAL.pdf</a>).  The review revealed significant organizational changes necessary to provide tribes the resources and support needed to directly operate high-performing schools, to remove institutional obstacles that hamper student achievement, and to enable principals to focus on instructional leadership. The review also highlighted the need to provide targeted and highly customized technical assistance that meets the unique instructional needs of each BIE-funded school, including instruction on the tribe’s language, history, and culture.</p>

<p>By September 30, 2015, the Department of the Interior will demonstrate maturing implementation of climate change adaptation as scored when carrying out strategies in its Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan.</p>
</p>
                               <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p><strong>Problem or opportunity being addressed</strong></p>
<p>The Department has established policy emphasizing the importance of considering and analyzing potential climate change impacts when undertaking long-range planning exercises. Such plans must evaluate risks to and vulnerabilities in bureau operations and missions, and outline actions to manage these in the short- and long-term. The Department continues to develop, implement and update comprehensive plans to integrate consideration of climate change science and response strategies into operations to help make the nation’s communities, watersheds, and natural resources more resilient, and safeguard our cultural heritage.</p>
<p><strong>Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives</strong></p>
<p>The Secretary of the Interior has identified the effects of climate change as a major challenge   affecting missions across the Department, just as the President has identified in his Climate Change Action Plan Policy and Executive Order 13514 (October 5, 2009) and on “Preparing the United States for the Impacts of Climate Change” (November 1, 2013).   The Department’s Climate Change Adaptation Policy (523 DM 1) provides a set of principles and guidance to bureaus and offices for addressing climate change impacts on the Department’s mission, programs, operations and personnel. The policy also establishes roles and responsibilities for carrying out climate change adaptation principles.</p>
<p><strong>Key barriers and challenges </strong></p>
<p>Understanding, communicating, and responding to the diversity of impacts associated with climate change across the various landscapes of the United States is an ambitious undertaking.  Identifying similar terminology and means of measurement, engaging in collaborative communications with partners both within and outside DOI, obtaining adequate scientific understanding, and integrating various datasets and information sources are just some aspects of this undertaking that are already underway, and each of these activities is challenging.</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong></p>
<p>Climate Science Centers and Landscape Conservation Cooperatives are engaging Interior and other Federal agencies, local and State partners, and the public to craft practical, landscape-level strategies for managing climate-change impacts within the eight regions.  The Department is building the scientific and organizational infrastructure to work with partners in the development of adaptation tools and the coordination of climate-change responses at the landscape level.  We are partnering to develop state-of-the-art strategies to translate science into adaptive management and to develop robust ecological-forecasting models.</p>

<p>By September 30, 2015, increase approved capacity authorized for renewable (solar, wind, and geothermal) energy resources affecting Department of the Interior managed lands, while ensuring full environmental review, to at least 16,500 Megawatts (since 2009).</p>
</p>
                               <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>The Obama Administration’s coordinated strategy to develop all appropriate sources of renewable and conventional energy on U.S. public lands calls for development of onshore and offshore renewable energy under a ‘Smart from the Start’ approach that prioritizes and processes existing applications in a coordinated, focused manner with full environmental analysis and public review.</p>
<p>As manager of one-fifth of the nation’s landmass and 1.7 billion acres of the outer continental shelf, the U.S. Department of the Interior has the resources to help America produce more energy at home, thereby supporting a growing economy and job creation and reducing dependence on foreign oil and increasing sustainable practices with reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Secretary Sally Jewell has placed a priority on “Powering Our Future,” emphasizing the responsible development of conventional and renewable resources on our nation’s public lands and waters.</p>
<p>Onshore, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has identified 20.6 million acres of public land with wind energy potential in 11 western states, 30 million acres with solar energy potential in six southwestern states, and 111 million acres of public land in western states and Alaska with geothermal resource potential.  Offshore, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) manages the Outer Continental Shelf, 1.7 billion acres of federal-offshore lands with enormous wind-energy potential, and approved in 2011 the construction plan for Cape Wind Energy off the coast of Massachusetts.</p>
<p>In addition to the multiple renewable energy efforts on public lands, the Department of Interior is reducing energy consumption within its own buildings while also self-generating renewable energy at over 1,000 Interior sites nationwide, including locations such as visitor centers, wildlife refuges, recreation centers, and tribal facilities.  Developing such renewable energy resources responsibly could help support a growing economy and protect our national interests while reducing our dependence on foreign oil and climate-changing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p><strong>Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives</strong></p>
<p>As the means for advancing the Administration’s ‘all-of-the-above’ strategy to develop domestic energy resources, realizing one of the Secretary of the Interior’s key priorities in creating a new energy frontier and as reflected in Interior’s Strategic Plan’s mission area to “Powering Our Future and Responsible Use of the Nation’s Resources,” this goal continues to expand upon the efforts started with the initial FY 2010/2011 Priority Goal to, “Increase approved capacity authorized for renewable (solar, wind, and geothermal) energy resources on Department of the Interior managed lands, while ensuring full environmental review, by at least 9,000 megawatts through 2011.”  As part of securing America’s energy future, DOI is helping to move our nation toward a clean-energy economy. At Interior, this means changing the way we do business by opening our doors to responsible development of renewable energy on our public lands. This means using a ‘Smart from the Start’ approach that prioritizes and processes existing applications in a coordinated, focused manner with full environmental analysis and public review.  Efforts include facilitating environmentally appropriate renewable-energy projects involving solar, wind and waves, geothermal, and hydropower. These resources, developed in the right ways and the right places, will help curb our dependence on foreign oil, reduce our use of fossil fuels and promote new industries and jobs here in America.</p>
<p><strong>Key barriers and challenges </strong></p>
<p>Renewable energy projects, especially solar and wind, are complex.  The Department is committed to permitting renewable energy projects on public lands in an environmentally responsible manner.  As a result, proposed projects are sometimes rejected or reduced in size and scope to avoid or minimize impacts to tribal and cultural resources, threatened and endangered species and their habitat, or areas near or adjacent to lands designated by Congress, the President, or Secretary for the protection of sensitive viewsheds, resources, and values that could be adversely affected by development.  Additionally, renewable energy companies sometimes decide to scale down, modify timelines and develop their projects in phases, or otherwise modify or withdraw projects for reasons unrelated to the permitting process.</p>
<p>By tracking progress on a quarterly basis, Interior is aware of the emerging complex issues and challenges associated with the formulation of renewable energy projects that require time and resources to address—including for example, rerouting and modification of plans to avoid impacts to natural resources like sensitive avian and wildlife species and tribal concerns.  Further, while Interior agencies play a critical role in facilitating the siting and permitting of renewable energy projects on public lands, there are other factors that impact a potential project’s progress, including the project proponent’s ability to secure financing and to obtain power purchase agreements with electric utility companies.  Technology and transmission constraints, such as an applicant needing to upgrade a transmission line, can also impact the overall schedule.</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong></p>
<p>This goal includes a broad number of stakeholders within Interior and externally.  It is a continuation of a FY 2012-2013 goal that was developed by BLM in concert with the Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management.  Other Federal agencies including DOI, USDA, EPA, NOAA; Interior bureaus including FWS, NPS, USGS; as well as States, local entities, conservation groups, industry and others  are engaged to advance the Administration’s ‘all-of-the-above’ strategy to develop domestic energy resources and to achieve one of the Secretary of the Interior’s top priorities for “Powering Our Future.”</p>

</p>
                               <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p><strong>Problem or opportunity being addressed</strong></p>
<p>The Nation faces an increasing set of water resource challenges: aging water-related infrastructure, rapid population growth, depletion of groundwater resources, and climate variability and change. Shortages and water use conflicts have become more commonplace in many areas of the US, even in "normal" years. Water issues and challenges are especially increasing in the West, due to prolonged drought and population shift.Traditional water management approaches, by themselves, no longer meet today's need.Federal leadership is critical to widespread acceptance and implementation of effective conservation and recycling techniques.</p>
<p><strong>Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives</strong></p>
<p>As the means for realizing one of the Secretary of the Interior’s key priorities for tackling the water challenges in the west, this goal will add to the achievements reflected in the Strategic Plan under the mission area to “Sustainably Manage Energy, Water, and Natural Resources.</p>
<p>Reclamation works collaboratively with non-federal, state, local and tribal governments, water districts, and other entities, on a cost-shared basis to implement projects that improve water management and result in water conservation in the 17 Western states.  This includes projects to line unlined canals, install remote technology to allow for more accurate control over water deliveries, install new water measurement devices, and other projects that allow water users to decrease water diversions by increasing efficiency and operational flexibility.  By conserving water that can be made available for other uses, these projects contribute to the goal by increasing the available water supply and contribute to Reclamation’s broader objective of achieving a more sustainable water supply.</p>
<p>A sustainable water supply is critical to address current and future water shortages; degraded water quality; increased demands for water from growing populations and energy needs; amplified recognition of environmental water requirements; the potential for decreased water supply availability due to drought, climate change, or decreased storage and delivery capacity; and water inequity for Indian tribes and rural communities disadvantaged by financial need or geographic isolation.  Reclamation believes that water conservation, use of water markets, and improved efficiency are crucial elements of any plan to address western water issues. With leveraged water sustainability grants, an important step will be taken towards increasing conservation for a more efficient use of water in the West.</p>
<p><strong>Key barriers and challenges </strong></p>
<p>The primary challenges and risks that influence achievement of the Priority Goal include:</p>
<ul><li>The availability of data needed to measure water conserved.</li>
<li>Water savings are heavily dependent upon applications submitted by project sponsors.</li>
<li>State Water Laws (e.g., disincentives to water conservation).</li>
<li>Ability to complete environmental compliance in a reasonable timeframe and cost.</li>
<li>Local cost-shares (e.g., inability to meet cost-share requirements identified by respective program).</li>
</ul><p><strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong></p>
<p>This goal is a continuation of the FY 2012-2013 goal that was developed by the Reclamation Commissioner and the Assistant Secretary Water and Science as a means for helping achieve one of the Secretary of the Interior’s top priorities in addressing the water challenges facing the western U.S.</p>
<p>Programs that contribute to the Priority Goal for Water Conservation provide funding for improvements proposed, planned, and carried out by non-Federal entities with Reclamation’s assistance.Collaboration is therefore a crucial aspect of efforts to achieve this Priority Goal. Reclamation also incorporates stakeholder feedback into its conservation efforts by engaging stakeholders during program formulation and significant program revisions.For example, Reclamation made draft funding criteria for the Title XVI Program available for public review and comment in 2010 and incorporated feedback into final criteria.Similarly, the WaterSMART Strategic Implementation Plan was published in the Federal Register in March 2011 and comments were incorporated into the final document.Reclamation also routinely works with its partners at the State and local level through public outreach meetings, scoping committees, and through reporting and program oversight.</p>

<p>By September 30, 2015, reduce rates of repeat incarceration in three target tribal communities by 3% through a comprehensive “alternatives to incarceration” strategy that seeks to address underlying causes of repeat offenses, including substance abuse and social service needs through tribal and federal partnerships.</p>
</p>
                               <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p><strong>Problem or opportunity being addressed</strong></p>
<p>The rate of recidivism nationally among Native Americans is estimated to be 33% higher than non-native populations, according to one Department of Justice report. Locally recidivism creates a huge drain on already overtaxed economies as well as overcrowded and dilapidated detention facilities.Individuals who repeat offend and are incarcerated, fill court dockets, and in many cases take primary bread winners out of the home.</p>
<p><strong>Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives</strong></p>
<p>This goal and associated activities will facilitate the ability of Interior to realize one of the President’s key objectives and a key priority for the Secretary of the Interior.  The effort is in direct support of the goal to re-establish the relationship with Indian Tribes and support the Strategic Goal to “Advance Government-to-Government Relationships with Indian Nations and Honor Commitments to Insular Areas.”</p>
<p><strong>Key barriers and challenges </strong></p>
<p>Conducting a focused program in highly geographically dispersed communities, with high levels of crime, disparate levels of staffing and training, and equipment have proven to be significant challenges.  Cooperation and support from Federal, State and tribal participants is a key requirement.  Tribal justice program commitment, differences and gaps in technology and program availability and participation is a key issue.  Funding increases for these program components has been aligned with the priority goal making this more feasible.</p>
<p>Other key challenges may include but not limited to:</p>
<ul><li>Record access of Tribal Correctional facilities</li>
<li>Availability of funding for components of the program that are not under Interior’s jurisdiction, e.g. detention facilities</li>
<li>Availability of substance abuse treatment programs – social program budgets, staffing and capacity have not kept pace with the increased law enforcement effort</li>
<li>Sentencing resources and alternative program availability.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong></p>
<p>The Department conducts consultation with tribal leaders and other stakeholders during the development of the budget and prior to the development and implementation of the Priority Goal on their respective reservations. This ensures a high level of understanding and commitment is received from all parties.</p>
<p>The Department has already begun to assist the Tribes in developing alternative to incarceration strategic plans based on the available resources in the community and or resources that stakeholders can provide to assist.</p>
<p>The Department assists the tribal programs with developing and coordinating stakeholder and community meetings throughout the initiative to discuss progress and any barriers or issues that may negatively affect meeting the goal.</p>

</p>
                               <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p><strong>a.  Problem or opportunity being addressed</strong></p>
<p>The future of the Country’s natural, cultural and historic heritage depends on the next generation of active stewards.  The Millennial generation, defined as individuals born in 1980 or later, is larger, more urban and diverse than any generation in our history.  Yet Millennials have grown up more disconnected from the natural world.  As Secretary Sally Jewell indicated,  “Engaging the millennial generation in service on public lands, welcoming them into the Department of the Interior, and so many other opportunities to have work within public lands management, is going to be a critical part of our future, if we care about these special places that help define us.”</p>
<p><strong>Secretary Sally Jewell, March 14, 2014 – Announcing the Next Generation Priority</strong>            <a href="http://www.doi.gov/youth/news/engaging-the-next-generation.cfm" target="_blank"><strong>http://www.doi.gov/youth/news/engaging-the-next-generation.cfm</strong></a></p>
<p>The underlying objective of Interior's Engaging the Next Generation priority is to establish meaningful and deep connections between young people from every background and every community to the great outdoors. Interior is investing millions of dollars in our <em>Engaging the Next Generation</em> priority to inspire millions of young people to play, learn, serve and work outdoors.  To that end, Interior has established a goal of providing 100,000 work and training opportunities over four years to individuals up to the age of 35.   In support of this long-term goal, the FY 2014-FY 2015 priority goal is being extended to include ages 15-35 in providing 40,000 work and training opportunity over the two year period, starting in FY 2015. </p>
<p>This priority goal complements Interior’s efforts to develop a 21<sup>st</sup> Century Workforce.  The Department benefits from a workforce that is passionate about the mission, dedicated to public service, and highly skilled and knowledgeable.  Across Interior, 40% of our permanent workforce will be eligible to retire within the next five years.   Providing a variety of work and training opportunities to students and recent graduates is critical to our succession planning. </p>
<p><strong>b.  Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives</strong></p>
<p>This priority goal supports Strategic Plan mission area 4, “Engaging the Next Generation” as well as efforts to create a 21<sup>st</sup> Century Workforce.  The priority goal aims to address reductions in work and training opportunities created by fiscal challenges in FY 2013 and builds upon the number of opportunities provided in FY 2010-FY 2012. </p>
<p>This priority goal for work and training opportunities builds upon other Engaging the Next Generation initiatives at DOI.  The Department’s goal of engaging youth in conservation includes programs to encourage the nation’s youth to play, learn, serve, and work in the great outdoors.  As the culmination of this four pronged approach, work and training opportunities for youth depend in great part on successful efforts to promote recreation on DOI-managed public lands, encourage the nation’s educators to bring our natural environment into classrooms, and cultivate a culture of service in support of conservation and natural resource management.</p>
<p><strong>c.  Key barriers and challenges </strong></p>
<p>Work and training opportunities, both directly by the Department and through partners, must occur within a specific time-frame for seasonal and temporary summer employment in order to secure commitments from participants.  If bureaus miss the window of opportunity during the limited time-frame, participants may seek employment opportunities elsewhere.  Additionally, with approximately one-third of DOI youth employment stemming from partnership agreements, budget uncertainty creates significant challenges to Bureaus’ ability to enter into partnership agreements, particularly for the peak hiring seasons when colleges are out of session.  These public/private partnership efforts help to leverage Federal dollars, in some cases by a 3 to 1 ratio, and assist the Department in increasing youth employment opportunities.</p>
<p>In FY 2013, fiscal and budgetary challenges significantly impacted the Department’s ability to fund work and training opportunities for youth.  Furthermore, the timing of the budgetary uncertainty, as well as the implementation of new models of youth employment across the government, via the Pathways program, made timely hiring of youth for those available positions difficult.  Should current budgetary and fiscal trends continue, the Department expects these to pose a barrier to fulfillment of this goal.</p>
<p><strong>d.  Stakeholder Engagement</strong></p>
<p>Key partners include the over 150 members of the Corps Network that engage 30,000 young people in all 50 States in addition to the work of the Public Lands Service Coalition.  These public/private partnership efforts help to leverage Federal dollars in some cases 3 to 1 and have assisted the Departments in increasing youth employment opportunities.  In addition, there are many non-profit, corporate, state, local and tribal entities that partner with the Department to enhance volunteer service opportunities and youth employment in the great outdoors. It will continue to be important to engage these stakeholders as we implement related recommendations for the broader youth stewardship and engagement priority goal.</p>

</p>
                               <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p><strong>Problem or opportunity being addressed</strong></p>
<p>The inspection of high risk producing oil and gas cases is paramount to help ensure that hydrocarbon production on federally managed lands are properly accounted for and results in accurate royalty payments to the public and Indian owners of such minerals.Oil and gas production on federally supervised lands represent a significant part of the nation’s hydrocarbon production.Operating regulations at 43 CFR 3161.3 (a) require the BLM to inspect all leases which produce high volumes of oil or natural gas and those leases that have a history of non-compliance at least once a year.The high risk cases are determined by four risk factors: production rating; number of missing Oil and Gas Operations Reports (OGOR); non-compliance rating; and, last production inspection date rating.</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>This effort is a component of addressing the deficiencies identified in the GAO High Risk report, which identified the areas for needed improvement including:</div>
</div>
</div>
<ol><li>ensuring data on production verification and royalties are consistent and reliable,</li>
<li>meeting goals for oil and gas verification inspections, and</li>
<li>ensuring that informal employee training is supported by formalized training courses offered on a consistent basis.</li>
</ol><p><strong>Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives</strong></p>
<p>Achieving a high rate of inspecting high risk producing cases will advance the BLM’s mission by ensuring that oil and gas operations are conducted in compliance with lease terms, with the regulations in title 43 CFR 3161.3 (a), and all other applicable regulations.  The BLM is charged, in Section 101. (a) of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982, with procedures to ensure that each federal and Indian lease site which is producing or is expected to produce significant quantities of oil or gas in any year or which has a history of non-compliance be inspected at least once annually.</p>
<p><strong>Key barriers and challenges </strong></p>
<p>The Bureau is limited in its ability to meet the requirement of inspecting all high risk cases by the number of certified inspectors available to inspect these cases.  Competing priorities take time from these inspectors in completing high risk production inspections.  High priority drilling and abandonment inspections must be completed prior to high risk production inspections.  In addition the Bureau has historically had a high turnover of certified inspectors.</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong></p>
<p>The Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Department of the Interior Office of Inspector General (OIG) has pointed out the failure of the BLM to adequately ensure production of federal and Indian minerals.  The BLM answered the requests from both the GAO and OIG.  This Priority Goal was created to help address some of the identified concerns while providing a forum by which the Department can continue to track the progress toward addressing the other concerns identified by GAO.  The goal was developed in concert with the White House and released with the President’s FY 2013 Budget.</p>
