<p>The Judiciary Act of 1789 created the Office of the Attorney General, providing for the appointment of “a person, learned in the law, to act as attorney-general for the United States.”  By 1870, the duties of the Office of the Attorney General had expanded so much that Congress adopted “An Act to establish the Department of Justice” with the Attorney General as its head.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Department of Justice serves to prevent terrorism and promote the Nation's security consistent with the rule of law; prevent crime, protect the rights of the American people, and enforce federal law; and ensure and support the fair, impartial, efficient, and transparent administration of justice at the federal, state, local, tribal, and international levels.</p>

<div class="intro_text">
<p>Established by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goals are a tool used to accelerate progress on a limited number of priority areas where implementation requires active collaboration between multiple agencies, overcoming organizational barriers to achieve better performance than one agency can achieve on its own.</p>
<p>Set or revised at least every four years, CAP Goals include outcome-oriented goals that cover a limited number of crosscutting policy areas as well as management goals focused on management improvements across the Federal Government in areas of financial management, strategic human capital management, information technology management, procurement and acquisition management, and real property management.</p>
<p>A series of 16 CAP Goals were announced in the 2015 Budget with clearly named accountable officials, data-driven reviews that incorporated a broad range of quantitative and qualitative inputs, and reporting to the public through a common website as a framework to drive performance improvements on cross-government collaboration and tackle government-wide management challenges affecting most agencies.</p>

<p>On June 30, 2016, the President signed into law the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 – nearly 50 years after President Johnson signed the original FOIA into law.  This critical legislation reflects the progress made by the Administration, codifies a number of openness and transparency principles, and ensures that the Administration’s track record of openness is institutionalized throughout government and carries forward for years to come.  Concurrent with the signing of the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, the White House released a Fact Sheet committing the Administration to:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Utilizing the Chief FOIA Officers Council and FOIA Advisory Committee to address FOIA’s greatest challenges;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promoting broader release of records through a “release to one is a release to all” presumption;</p>

</div>  </div>  
  <div class="views-field views-field-field-cag-overview-revision-id">    <span class="views-label views-label-field-cag-overview-revision-id">Overview: </span>    <div class="field-content"><p>On March 19, 2015, the President issued Executive Order 13693, <em>Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade</em>, which set forth ambitious climate, energy, and environmental sustainability goals for Federal agencies over the next decade.  Executive departments and agencies have been among our Nation’s leaders as the United States works to build a clean energy economy that will sustain our prosperity and the health of our people and our environment for generations to come. Federal leadership in energy, environmental water, transportation fleets, buildings, and acquisition management will continue to drive national greenhouse gas reductions and support preparations for the impacts of climate change. The Federal Government has the opportunity to significantly reduce direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2025, while at the same time fostering innovation, reducing spending, and strengthening the communities in which our Federal facilities operate. </p>
<p>Employing this strategy for the next decade calls for expanded and updated Federal environmental performance goals with a clear overarching objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions across Federal operations and the Federal supply chain.  Goals for greenhouse gas emissions reduction (40% by 2025), renewable electricity (30% by 2025), clean energy (25% by 2025), and performance contracting ($4 billion in awarded contracts by Dec. 2016) are already well established in the Federal community. The enhanced target for each of these goals will require agencies to sharpen their focus on achieving the goals through existing mechanisms and new technologies that enhance efficiency and use of clean energy.</p>
<p>CEQ and OMB have worked closely to ensure that Federal agencies understand the necessary steps to pursuing the new environmental sustainability goals and those efforts are supported by an interagency Steering Committee.  Pursuit of these sustainability goals will involve at least 25 of the largest Federal agencies. Success will be greatly enhanced by the cross-cutting nature of the goals and the similarity in the tools and procedures used for implementation.</p>
<p>While all Federal agencies have an important role to play in ensuring the Government meets its energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets, key delivery agencies include: The General Services Administration, Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Energy, National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Department of Homeland Security.</p>

In the wake of increasing threats and incidents, the President directed a series of reviews to examine current security, suitability/fitness, and credentialing processes and to recommend areas in need of reform. The interagency reviews identified problem areas and made specific recommendations, which were approved by the Performance Accountability Council (PAC). The PAC developed the Strategic Intent to build upon these efforts and create a lasting impact by providing overarching strategic direction to personnel security, suitability/fitness, and credentialing reform efforts for the next five years.  </p>
<p>The Strategic Intent represents our framework for sustaining progress mandated by the February 2014 Suitability and Security Processes Review Report to the President, the January 2016 PAC Review of Background Investigations, relevant legislation, and other key drivers. It builds on progress since the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 and the subsequent, significant reform efforts that resulted in greater standardization and alignment of suitability and security processes. Through this framework, the PAC will work with other members of the Executive Branch to drive continuous process improvement to personnel security, suitability/fitness, and credentialing programs and address evolving threats. While we cannot eliminate risk altogether, it is imperative that we work across disciplines to maximize our collective efforts to mitigate the risks we face, while ensuring appropriate protections for privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. We must ensure measures to improve these programs avoid imposing unreasonable burdens on the Federal workforce that could negatively impact operations. Therefore, the Federal Government will pursue a balanced approach by addressing the risks posed by personnel who could do significant harm by virtue of the nature of their position.</p>
<p>These reforms will further support ongoing Insider Threat Program implementation by providing earlier detection and improving the quality of vetting. The improved attention to cybersecurity will reinforce efforts to protect sensitive mission data, including personally-identifiable information. </p>

According to AT Kearney’s Foreign Direct Investment Confidence Index, confidence in the U.S. as a location for FDI is high, ranking as the top destination for investment ahead of China, Brazil, Canada, and India.<sup>1 </sup>The U.S. remains the world’s largest economy and is also the largest recipient of foreign direct investment in the world. Over the last ten years, U.S. affiliates of foreign companies have employed more than five million workers, the majority of which are high-paying manufacturing jobs. On average, jobs created by FDI in United States pay up to 30% more.<sup>2</sup>  However, due to global capital mobility and increased foreign competition, we need to take steps to maintain and grow our share of global investment.</p>
<p>Historically, we have left our states and cities to compete for investments with a country’s investment promotion agency, limiting our opportunities to clearly demonstrate our commitment to attracting investment and to leverage our advantages as a top destination for investment. In 2011, through Executive Order, the U.S. launched SelectUSA, the first Federal effort to promote and facilitate inbound business investment. The E.O. created the Interagency Investment Working Group (IIWG) to further design and implement the first-ever coordinated U.S. investment promotion authority. As a driver for success, the global investment team, consisting of both SelectUSA headquarters in DC and investment teams at posts led by Ambassadors, will increase the number of active investment cases touched to encourage business investments.</p>
<p>At the first SelectUSA Investment Summit in Oct 31-Nov. 1 2013, the President reformed SelectUSA, creating a number of firsts: for the first time there will be a clear system for advocacy for high-priority, job-creating investments, driven by the most senior Administration officials all the way up to the President; for the first time there will be a single point of contact for ready investors looking to bring jobs and production to the U.S.; lastly, the Administration is engaging in unprecedented coordinated support for states and localities to attract investment.</p>
<p>Key contributing agencies to the Job-Creating Investment CAP goal include the Department of Commerce, Small Business Administration, US Department of Agriculture, Department of State, Department of Homeland Security, and Export-Import Bank of the U.S.</p>

Over time, the process and legal requirements for the permitting and review of major infrastructure projects have developed in a siloed and ad-hoc way, creating complex processes that in some cases have taken years or longer to complete.  Although there are several reasons why a major infrastructure project may be delayed (including applicant funding uncertainty and state and local reviews), over the past three years the Administration has undertaken an ambitious effort to modernize the Federal government’s role in permitting and review processes.</p>
<p>To ensure his Administration took action to modernize these permitting and review processes, on March 22, 2012, the President signed Executive Order 13604, Improving Performance of Federal Permitting and Review of Infrastructure Projects and subsequently a Presidential Memorandum on May 17, 2013, charging an interagency Steering Committee to lead the development of a plan to turn best practices into standard practice.  This Implementation Plan identifies four strategies, 15 reforms, and nearly 100 both near-term and long-term milestones.  The strategies are:</p>
<ul><li>Strategy 1: Institutionalize Interagency Coordination and Transparency, by formalizing interagency coordination policies, including early identification of a lead agency; synchronizing Federal review and permitting processes and decisions; standardizing the use of the Infrastructure Permitting Dashboard; and identifying best practices for early engagement with State, Local and Tribal governments.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Strategy 2:  Improve Project Planning, Siting, and Application Quality by developing tools to assist project applicants in planning for a major infrastructure project and support effective and timely decision-making by agency staff once the Federal processes begins. </li>
</ul><ul><li>Strategy 3: Improve Permitting Reviews and Mitigation by supporting agency staff in effectively implementing existing regulations, policies, and guidance as well as identifying barriers. This strategy also includes policies to facilitate advance planning for the mitigation of project impacts and landscape- or watershed-level approaches to mitigation, where appropriate.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Strategy 4: Drive Continued Improvement.  Fully implementing these actions and achieving the President’s goal will require a team dedicated to implementing the reforms on an interagency basis, further analyze agency processes, and identify additional reforms.  This strategy includes a proposal to establish a dedicated interagency team to support the ongoing improvement of Federal permitting and review responsibilities for major infrastructure projects.  In addition, this strategy includes a proposal to develop reliable metrics to track timeframes and outcomes for communities and the environment.</li>

Advances in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) have long been central to our Nation’s ability to manufacture better and smarter products, improve health care, develop cleaner and more efficient domestic energy sources, preserve the environment, safeguard national security, and grow the economy. For the United States to maintain its preeminent position in the world it will be essential that the Nation continues to lead in STEM, but evidence indicates that current educational pathways are not leading to a sufficiently large and well-trained STEM workforce to achieve this goal, nor is the U.S. education system cultivating a culture of STEM education necessary for a STEM-literate public. Thus it is essential that the United States enhance U.S. students’ engagement in STEM disciplines and inspire and equip many more students to excel in STEM fields.</p>
<p>A number of Federal agencies place a high priority on STEM education and have developed education initiatives unique to their agency’s mission, needs, and resources.  To better leverage Federal assets, expertise, and partnerships toward a goal of national importance, a cross agency priority to improve STEM education has been developed to increase agency coordination and use of evidence-based approaches to improve P-12 STEM instruction, increase and sustain youth and public engagement in STEM, enhance the STEM experience of undergraduate students, better serve groups historically underrepresented in STEM fields, design graduate education for tomorrow’s STEM workforce, build new models for leveraging assets and expertise, and build and use evidence-based approaches. </p>

</div>  </div>  
  <div class="views-field views-field-field-cag-overview-revision-id">    <span class="views-label views-label-field-cag-overview-revision-id">Overview: </span>    <div class="field-content"><p>The American people deserve a Government that is responsive to their needs. Citizens and businesses expect government services to be well-designed, efficient, and generally comparable to the services they receive from leading private sector organizations. Whether they call the IRS for an answer to a tax question or visit a Social Security Administration office to adjust their benefits, they should experience high-quality interactions with the Federal Government. Despite some important strides to improve customer service over the past fifteen years, too often many Federal Government services fail to meet the expectations of citizens and business, creating unnecessary hassle and cost for citizens, businesses, and the government itself.  The Federal Government must keep pace with the public’s expectations and transform its customer services – soliciting regular customer feedback, streamlining processes, and delivering consistent quality service across customer channels.</p>
<p>To that end, in April 2011 the President issued an<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/27/executive-order-streamlining-service-delivery-and-improving-customer-ser" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/27/executive-order-streamlining-service-delivery-and-improving-customer-ser">Executive Order</a> requiring each agency to develop a customer service plan that identified implementation steps for their customer service activities, including a "signature initiative" that uses technology to improve the customer experience. Agencies posted the plans on their Open Government websites in October 2011, and this goal will build on these plans to streamline and improve customer service delivery.</p>
<p>To build upon the progress being made by individual agencies, the Administration is taking action to deliver improved customer service across the Federal enterprise.  The Administration will:</p>
<ul><li><em>Streamline transactions.</em>  Too often the processes and procedures of government have been developed piecemeal over time, and have not been regularly reexamined to ensure they are designed with the user experience in mind.  The Administration will identify transactions with a high impact on a significant number of citizens and streamline processes, better meet customer needs, and use performance measures to improve services.  This includes areas such as TSA security screening, veterans’ pension and disability applications, income-based repayment of student loans, Social Security, and taxpayer assistance.</li>
<li><em>Develop standards for high impact services.</em>  Citizen expectations for government services are continually increasing, driven by improvements in technology and the high quality services provided by the private sector.  Government leaders have a responsibility to understand customer expectations and service needs, and continually evaluate and improve their effectiveness in meeting those needs.  To facilitate this, many government programs that provide direct services to the public can benefit from setting customer service standards, clearly communicating these standards to customers, and ensuring these standards are being met.  The Administration will identify best practices in setting customer service standards, such as placing an emphasis on first contact resolution, and facilitate implementation of these practices for high impact services.</li>
<li><em>Utilize technology to improve the customer experience.</em>  The Administration will work to deliver world-class customer services to citizens by making it faster and easier for individuals and businesses to complete transactions with government online.  Given the continually growing importance of online services, the Administration has established a separate Cross-Agency Priority Goal to focus resources and attention on this priority area. </li>

The Administration will work with agencies to utilize existing authorities to attract top talent and consult with Agencies, the Office of Personnel Management, and Congressional stakeholders to expand the use of flexible hiring authorities. The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will also work with Agencies to incubate and scale new approaches to the design, development and delivery of top digital services and transactions.</li>
<li>Get the best companies working with government. The Administration’s efforts in this area will focus on streamlining the Federal IT acquisition process. Specific initiatives include creating more visibility of contracting opportunities for small, innovative companies; maximizing the use of available contracting flexibilities and best practices; and recommending administrative changes to the IT procurement processes.</li>
<li>Put the right processes and practices in place to drive outcomes and accountability. OMB will create and apply a new oversight and management process to highest impact IT investments in the Federal government. This process will include the best IT development and management approaches employed by the public and private sectors.  Lessons learned from this oversight process will be used to expand best practices across all agency IT investments.</li>

Today, proposals for contracts are lengthy, overly prescriptive, and laden with Government-specific requirements. There is also staggering duplication of contracts across Government and very little information sharing between agencies on pricing or other important contractual information. In order to fundamentally improve how taxpayer dollars are used in the Federal contracting space, the Administration is embarking on a comprehensive initiative to enhance collaboration and cooperation and drive greater innovation and improved performance through the implementation of Category Management.</p>
<p>This cross-agency priority (CAP) goal is focused on category management and will build on the progress made in the strategic sourcing initiative, leveraging the consolidated purchasing power of the Government to buy smarter and reduce duplication.  Category management is a new, more strategic approach that will enable the federal government to buy smarter and more like a single enterprise.  It involves identifying core areas of spend, developing heightened levels of expertise, leveraging shared best practices, providing streamlined solutions for acquisition, and managing supply and demand.  The objective is to increase efficiency and effectiveness while reducing costs and redundancies.  The first area of focus for category management is information technology and the CAP goal will support this initiative.  The objectives of the Category Management CAP goal will be expanded as the Category Management Leadership Council endorses other areas of focus.  The CAP Goal metrics can be found on the “supporting materials tabs” and progress updates will begin in the final Quarter of FY15.  </p>

If we are focused, committed, systematic, and intentional, we can make the sort of transformative changes in our service delivery approach that have altered the course of the commercial retail marketplace and reinvigorated American manufacturing. </p>
<p>We need to commit to driving efficiencies by creating opportunities to leverage existing resources and pool the government’s buying power.  This involves building common standards for underlying support activities and systems and driving out redundancy in administrative service provision.  It means changing agency expectations and incentives for spending.  And it means rethinking the way that the government considers and funds long-term investments in the systems and infrastructure that support customer service delivery. </p>
<p>The Federal Government will leverage the Executive Councils to develop common standards and benchmarks to measure shared service utilization, performance, and cost. Mandate those standards and benchmarks for common administrative services. From these standards and benchmarks we will drive efficiencies and greater performance by: 1) increasing the capacity of the Federal Shared Service Providers (SSPs) at DOI, USDA, Treasury, HHS, DOT and DOD; and 2) requiring use of lower-cost, higher-performing Shared Services for all agencies and SSPs which cannot meet established targets. We will target the following areas for Shared Services (listed in order of priority): financial, HR, technology, and acquisition.</p>

<p>The Administration will sustain and intensify these efforts in the second term by:</p>
<ul><li>Establishing cost and quality benchmarks for core/administrative operations, such as HR, Finance, Acquisition, and IT.  We will leverage the agency executive councils to develop common standards and benchmarks to measure shared service utilization, performance, and cost.  We will then use those standards and benchmarks for common administrative services as the baseline for driving continuous improvements in performance.</li>
<li>Cutting improper payments. Building on work already completed which has significantly reduced improper payments, we will advance data analytics and improved technology through the “Do Not Pay” tool to prevent these payments from happening, with the goal of a government-wide improper payment rate of 3 percent or less by the end of 2016.</li>
<li>Saving on real estate costs.  By expanding on the “Freeze the Footprint” policy issued in 2012, we will begin publically tracking the Government’s adherence to a fixed baseline, and will continue to work with Agencies to pursue mobile workforce strategies and tighter internal controls.

<p>The Administration has made significant progress in improving the management of information resources to increase interoperability and openness. In executive order 13642 President Obama outlined a clear vision for “Making Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information” wherever possible and legally permissible. The subsequently released Open Data Policy (OMB memorandum M-13-13) directed agencies to effectively “manage the information as a strategic asset” throughout its lifecycle and make data open by default to the extent permitted by law, while ensuring strict controls to safeguard individual privacy, confidentiality, and national security. </p>
<p>As a direct result, Americans are getting better access to government information and services they need. Homeowners who are struggling to pay their mortgages now get prompt, clear responses because companies are competing based on open consumer financial product complaint data published by CFPB, and can stay in their homes. Similarly, patients can now comparison shop to see which hospitals have the best outcomes and best prices thanks to data published by Medicaid and HHS—including a new dataset that for the first time shows what hospitals charge for inpatient services associated with the 100 most common kinds of hospital stays, revealing huge variations in hospital charges across the country and even within metro areas.</p>
<p>To drive further impact and results, the Open Data CAP Goal will focus on a series of government-wide objectives, strategies and major metrics that facilitate and gauge the outcome-oriented and management improvement goals of Open Data.  Metrics will prioritize three channels of impact measurement: impact on economic value creation organizations, impact on existing public program outcomes, and impact on internal government efficiency.  </p>

<ul><li>Create a Culture of Excellence and Engagement to Enable Higher Performance.  We will foster a culture of excellence by using data-driven approaches to enhance management, performance, and innovation across the current Federal workforce.  Specifically, we will focus on employee engagement (measured by employee views about their leaders, supervisors, and work experience), as multiple evaluations have demonstrated a strong correlation between employee engagement and an organization’s productivity.  Agencies can now get access to this data for over 13,000 work-level units across the country (up from just a few hundred units four years ago).  This level of specificity in data will provide agency managers with actionable information to target areas where improvement is needed most and where there are management best practices that can provide a model for success.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul><li>Build a World-Class Federal Management Team Starting with the Senior Executive Service (SES). To ensure a first-class Federal workforce long-term, we will invest in our civil service leadership by taking administrative actions that result in a broader experience and skill base across the Federal Executive Corps.  This includes addressing the “pain points” in the hiring process and enhancing training and accountability over the terms of their service.</li>

<ul><li>Enable Agencies to Hire the Best Talent from All Segments of Society.  We will collaborate with Federal stakeholders and labor groups to ensure a balanced strategic approach to improving hiring outcomes. In the short term, we will identify and address the erosion of the original flexibilities of Title 5.  In the long term, we will work closely with labor unions and use demonstration projects and/or legislation and regulatory changes to ensure that our hiring processes attract and retain America’s talent.  We will measure the success of this effort by assessing manager satisfaction with the quality of both applicants and their hires after six months on the job. </li>

                    <p>Agencies establish a variety of organizational goals to drive progress toward key outcomes for the American people. Long-term strategic goals articulate clear statements of what the agency wants to achieve to advance its mission and address relevant national problems, needs, challenges and opportunities. Strategic objectives define the outcome or management impact the agency is trying to achieve, and also include the agency's role. Each strategic objective is tracked through a suite of performance goals, indicators and other evidence.

<p> </p>
<p>Cyber activities, likewise, constitute a growing threat to our national security.  As an initial matter, an increasing number of sophisticated state and non-state actors have both the desire and the capability to steal sensitive data, trade secrets, and intellectual property for military and competitive advantage.  In addition, cyber-enabled terrorism poses a viable threat to national security.   Although the United States has not yet encountered terrorist organizations using the Internet to launch a full-scale cyber-attack, the Department believes that it is a question of when, not if, they will attempt to do so.  The cyber threat demands ready and fluid means of sharing information and coordinating actions and responses.  In order to successfully investigate and disrupt cyber threats, the Department must be creative and forward-looking in its approach, considering what kinds of tools, investigations, and outreach can be launched now to lay the groundwork for future cyber protective efforts.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Cyber activities, likewise, constitute a growing threat to our national security.  As an initial matter, an increasing number of sophisticated state and non-state actors have both the desire and the capability to steal sensitive data, trade secrets, and intellectual property for military and competitive advantage.  In addition, cyber-enabled terrorism poses a viable threat to national security.   Although the United States has not yet encountered terrorist organizations using the Internet to launch a full-scale cyber-attack, the Department believes that it is a question of when, not if, they will attempt to do so.  The cyber threat demands ready and fluid means of sharing information and coordinating actions and responses.  In order to successfully investigate and disrupt cyber threats, the Department must be creative and forward-looking in its approach, considering what kinds of tools, investigations, and outreach can be launched now to lay the groundwork for future cyber protective efforts.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The vast majority of violent crime in this country falls within the jurisdiction of state and local agencies, and the vast majority of resources to combat it are provided by state and local governments.  While some cities are well-equipped to handle issues involving violent gangs, many smaller cities and towns are easily overwhelmed by the violence and criminal activity that gangs bring to their communities.  Each community faces different challenges that will require different solutions.</p>

<p>The Department will combat violent crime through vigorous investigation and prosecution of those who engage in violent criminal acts.  It will work with its law enforcement partners at the federal, state, local, tribal, and international level to combat all types of violence, from the neighborhood-based street gangs, to increasingly brutal and prevalent violence along the Southwest Border, to the transnational gangs operating throughout the United States and abroad, to violent criminals seeking haven in the United States.  It will also employ a comprehensive strategy that focuses on investigation, prosecution, and prevention efforts to address violence in America.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Unfortunately, children are but one segment of society that is at risk.  In the United States and across the globe, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, human trafficking, and stalking occur in all ages, races, socioeconomic classes, genders, and sexual orientations.  Research shows that these crimes are overwhelmingly committed against women.  In addition, elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation is an area that has been overlooked but research suggests it is an ongoing problem in the United States.  Further, victims of crime committed on tribal lands is also an area that has been overlooked for far too long as research suggests violent crime rates may be two, four, and in some cases, 10 times the national average.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Department continues to stress efforts to reduce and respond to violence against vulnerable populations.  In April of 2013, the Department issued a revised Sexual Assault Forensic Examination Protocol to standardize up-to-date approaches to victim-centered forensic medical examinations.  DOJ will also work with the FBI to support states’ implementation of the revised Uniform Crime Report definition of “rape.”  As part of the Attorney General’s Defending Childhood Initiative, the Department will: launch a public awareness and community action campaign to stem youth violence; establish a Task Force on American Indian/Alaska Native Children Exposed to Violence; and partner with select states to form “State Commissions” that will implement model public policy initiatives at the state and local level to reduce the impact of children’s exposure to violence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All victims deserve to be treated with respect and support.  The Department will address the needs of victims by investigating and prosecuting matters impacting vulnerable groups while leading the way in providing innovative training, resources, and support to victims of crime.</p>

<p>The Southwest Border region is a particularly vulnerable area and has increasingly become a focal point in the national security strategy due to the considerable cross-border law enforcement challenges in the region.  The flow of narcotics north into the United States, along with the smuggling of criminal monetary proceeds and the illegal trafficking of firearms south out of the United States has had a devastating effect on the United States and Mexico, particularly along the Southwest Border.  Much of the violence along the Southwest Border region and in Mexico is perpetuated by drug trafficking organizations vying for control of trafficking routes to the United States and engaging in turf battles for disputed distribution territories.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The vast 5,225-mile border between the United States and Canada, and the evolving drug trafficking trends on both sides of that border, provide numerous challenges for law enforcement and intelligence entities operating along the Northern border under differing authorities, protocols, and expertise.  Marijuana and Ecstasy remain the most significant Northern border drug threats to the United States, while the United States remains the primary transit country for cocaine into Canada from South America.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>These offenses represent separate and very severe threats to the United States’ economy.  The corruption of federal, state, and locally elected, appointed, or contracted officials, whether foreign or domestic, undermines democratic institutions and may threaten the condition of the economy, public safety, and national security, while wasting many taxpayer dollars.  As businesses, governments, educational institutions, and individual citizens continue to integrate the Internet and other global network computer systems, extortionists, hostile insiders, identity thieves, and other criminals have new opportunities and new venues to commit unlawful acts.  The increased presence of fraud such as corporate fraud, securities fraud, healthcare fraud, and mortgage fraud have escalated and will continue to hamper economic recovery and persist long after any recovery occurs.  IP crime poses a grave threat to the country’s economic well-being, as well as the health and safety of U.S. citizens.  Finally, transnational crime has expanded dramatically in size, scope, and influence, and transnational criminal networks pose a significant threat to national and international security.  In response, the Department will implement actions to support the Administration’s <em>Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime</em>, which seeks to build, balance, and integrate the tools of American power to combat transnational organized crime and related threats to national security and urge America’s foreign partners to do the same.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Department will pursue fraud and corruption committed against the Federal Government and state and local governments and their programs and will protect consumers through vigorous investigations and civil and criminal enforcement of federal laws.  These efforts will return significant amounts to the Treasury, Medicare, and other entitlement programs every year and provide deterrence to those contemplating defrauding federal programs, businesses, and individual citizens.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Crimes committed in the United States often have ties to networks or operations in other countries.  To address these threats, the Department is committed to expanding the scope and depth of international partnerships by enhancing collaboration; helping to establish rule of law through international treaties and training and assistance; and using international working groups to foster communication to enhance investigations, intelligence sharing, and threat awareness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Overall, the Department will continue to ensure that law enforcement at every level, domestic and international, is engaged in the fair, impartial, efficient, and transparent administration of justice.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Crimes of mass violence often lead to international instability, which puts the United States’ security and interests at risk.  Lack of accountability for past mass human rights violations increases the risk that such crimes will be repeated.  For more than 60 years, the U.S. Government has been a worldwide leader in efforts to end impunity for genocide, torture, war crimes, and other egregious human rights violations by holding perpetrators accountable in the United States through prosecutions or other available means.  The Department will continue its longstanding efforts to prevent the United States from becoming a safe haven for the perpetrators of mass human rights violations and to support foreign and international efforts to hold such perpetrators accountable.  The Department will also coordinate with other U.S. Government agencies to achieve an effective, whole-of-government approach to preventing genocide and mass atrocity.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Under delegated authority from the Attorney General, EOIR interprets and administers federal immigration laws by conducting immigration court proceedings, appellate reviews, and administrative hearings.  The Department’s ability to process cases in a timely fashion directly affects DHS’ ability to remove criminal or other removable aliens expeditiously and to efficiently use its detention resources.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition to these efforts, the Civil Division’s Office of Immigration Litigation (OIL) expertly defends government agencies in immigration-related litigation and issues that arise from EOIR decisions, such as when aliens file petitions for review in the circuit courts of appeals.  The caseload for OIL is directly tied to DHS’s adjudications and immigration enforcement, to the Department of State’s adjudication of passport applications, to the number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement referrals for denaturalization, to Department of Labor actions regarding immigrant labor, and to the immigration adjudication rates of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA).  OIL will continue to implement efficiencies and effectively manage its resources to meet this demanding workload.</p>

The Department of Justice (DOJ) supports community policing through a broad range of training and technical assistance activities. These activities are implemented along a continuum that starts with the initial contact with law enforcement and/or community members looking for new or promising practices to address problems in their community.  Typically, these problems are addressed through outreach, publications, or awareness training.  By working with the community to implement more complex needs for community policing, the community becomes involved in their own safety. This proactive approach consists of training law enforcement and the community together, community meetings/interventions, and trust building activities. When a community has significant trust issues or a law enforcement is in need of reform, the technical assistance and training becomes more in depth, site specific, and targeted to promote change. For those communities where there exists a strong bond and a vibrant community policing program, providing technical assistance and training will build upon that trust and increase the viability of the program.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>This goal aligns with Administration cybersecurity priorities.  The goal was established in coordination with OMB policies and guidance, to include the Cybersecurity Strategy and Implementation Plan, the Fiscal Year 2015-2016 Guidance on Federal Information Security and Privacy Management Requirements, and the Cybersecurity Cross-Agency Priority Goal.</p>

                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Statement:</span><p>Protect the American people from fraud and public corruption. By September 30, 2017, increase the number of new investigations by 2 percent with emphasis on holding individuals accountable associated with fraud and public corruption, including white collar crime, financial fraud, and health care fraud.</p>
</p>
                                <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>The term white collar crime is synonymous with a full range of frauds committed by business and government professionals. It is not a victimless crime. A single scam can destroy a company, devastate families by wiping out their life savings, or cost society billions of dollars (or even all three). Today’s fraud schemes are more sophisticated than ever. The financial crisis of 2008, impacting every American, resulted in fraud and deception in the finance and housing markets, as well as fraudulent schemes that misused the public’s unprecedented investment in economic recovery. The distressed condition of the national housing market, paired with high unemployment, created a fertile environment for unscrupulous fraudsters seeking to take advantage of desperate homeowners. Criminals who commit mortgage fraud, securities and commodities fraud, and other types of fraud victimize the American public as a whole. Similarly, those who defraud Medicare, Medicaid, and other government health care programs defraud every American. Fraudsters take critical resources out of our health care system—thus contributing to the rising cost of health care for all Americans and endangering the short-term and long-term solvency of these essential health care programs. The Department will address these critical problems by vigorously investigating and prosecuting white collar crimes, including financial fraud and health care fraud, in order to protect American businesses, consumers, and taxpayers. Fraud and public corruption, as reported by this Priority Goal, include a number of criminal and civil reporting categories including but not limited to: financial crime and corruption; public and corporate fraud, including health care fraud and mortgage fraud; public corruption; computer/cybercrime; identity theft; intellectual property crimes; and procurement fraud. Public corruption is a breach of trust by federal, state, or local officials—often with the help of private sector accomplices. Public corruption misdirects public monies, distorts governmental decision-making and threatens our democratic processes. Corrupt public officials undermine our country’s national security, our overall safety, the public trust, and confidence in the U.S. government, wasting billions of dollars. This corruption can tarnish virtually every aspect of society. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), passed in 1977, makes it illegal for U.S. companies, U.S. persons, and foreign corporations with certain U.S. ties to bribe foreign officials to obtain or retain business overseas. Foreign bribery can impact U.S. financial markets, economic growth, and national security. It also breaks down the international free market system by promoting anti-competitive behavior and, ultimately, makes consumers pay more. The Department will pursue criminal and civil litigation to protect the federal fisc and hold accountable corrupt officials and those who commit fraud; and promote transparency in markets by preserving competition and protecting consumers and investors.</p>

<p>By September 30, 2015, the Department of Justice will: Disrupt 175 terrorist threats and groups and disrupt and dismantle 600 cyber threat actors.</p>
</p>
                               <p><span class="acc_content_label">Description:</span><p>Terrorism is the most significant national security threat that the country faces.  Accordingly, the Department’s number one priority is, and will continue to be, protecting the security of this Nation’s citizens.  The Administration has recognized that terrorism cannot be defeated by military means alone.  The Department of Justice serves at the forefront of the fight against terrorism, providing a broad spectrum of tools, resources, and skills to combat terrorists.  Specifically, the Department’s agents, analysts, and prosecutors will continue to use every available resource and appropriate tool to detect, deter, and disrupt terrorist plots, investigate and prosecute terrorists, and aid in developing rule of law programs in post-conflict countries to help prevent terrorism abroad.  The Department will aggressively pursue emerging threats around the world and at home, enhance the ability to gather and analyze actionable intelligence, and engage in outreach efforts to all communities in order to prevent terrorism before it occurs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Cyber activities, likewise, constitute a growing threat to our national security.  As an initial matter, an increasing number of sophisticated state and non-state actors have both the desire and the capability to steal sensitive data, trade secrets, and intellectual property for military and competitive advantage.  In addition, cyber-enabled terrorism poses a viable threat to national security.   Although the United States has not yet encountered terrorist organizations using the Internet to launch a full-scale cyber-attack, the Department believes that it is a question of when, not if, they will attempt to do so.  The cyber threat demands ready and fluid means of sharing information and coordinating actions and responses.  In order to successfully investigate and disrupt cyber threats, the Department must be creative and forward-looking in its approach, considering what kinds of tools, investigations, and outreach can be launched now to lay the groundwork for future cyber protective efforts.</p>
