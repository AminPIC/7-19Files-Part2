"Social Security Administration",16,SSA,"Build a Model Workforce to Deliver Quality Service",1035,1042,"Strengthen the Competency, Agility, and Performance of Our Workforce to Align with the Needs of the Public",,"Changing business processes require our employees to increasingly demonstrate flexibility and resilience.  We must assist our employees by providing timely training and development opportunities, as well as appropriate tools and resources.  We must find ways for employees to develop more flexible career paths.  To enhance performance, we must ensure that we hold employees accountable for their actions and provide them timely and effective supervisory feedback.  We must also ensure we have programs in place to strengthen our management and leadership ranks.  Supporting our managers through training, as well as with tools and resources (e.g., guidelines, procedures, best practices, desk guides, automated systems) is important in ensuring effective leadership in the face of ever-increasing change and complexity.  Training and employee development will be critical to improving the competency and agility of our workforce and are key initiatives for the agency.  We cannot afford during difficult budget times to sacrifice training and development – if we cut back in these areas, our service delivery will decline in the future.  Increasing online services will also draw less complex work away from the field offices, so we must commit to offering highly trained staff to address the more difficult questions that will come into our field offices.  Strategies:   	Ensure effective use of the agency’s performance management systems to manage employee performance; 	Improve supervisory competencies and develop talent for future leadership opportunities; 	Create knowledge management tools and processes to ensure the capture of institutional knowledge (e.g., effective use of reemployed retirees); 	Reduce skill gaps in targeted mission critical occupations to support talent development of employees; and 	Offer ongoing access to training and development resources to support continual learning.","Office of Human Resources","Progress Update  We took the following steps in FY 2015 to strengthen the competency, agility and performance of our workforce (see Key Initiatives and Performance Measures for more details):  • Enhanced employee-management communications:  o Acknowledged employee work contributions through monetary and honor award recognitions;  o Expanded program efforts for knowledge management, managerial, and leadership development; and  o Implemented Skills Connect pilot as part of our GovConnect initiative.  • Launched National Mentoring Program pilot;  • Implemented supervisor proficiencies plans and leadership initiatives:  o Established internal leadership development programs; and  o Rolled out Leadership Essentials for New Supervisors.  • Procured an updated Learning Management System with competency modeling capability;  • Worked with Office of Personnel Management to develop a framework for competency/skills development and assessment;  • Implemented Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) One Stop, a comprehensive online library of up-to-date, legally compliant, uniform information about EEO laws, policies, and procedures, for employees, managers, and EEO practitioners nationwide; and  • Launched wEEO Radio, an innovative mechanism to disseminate EEO training to managers nationwide via bi-monthly “radio broadcasts” (teleconferences) in a talk show format.  Next Steps  • Evaluate Skills Connect pilot and prepare for agency-wide launch;  • Assess merit-based execution of the Performance Culture gauged by evaluation of performance and award actions;  • Continue to enhance Performance Assessment and Communications System training; and  • Develop continuous learning programs for experienced supervisors and managers that will include an assessment and job coaching.",Management,,,
