"Social Security Administration",16,SSA,"Serve the Public through a Stronger, More Responsive Disability Program",1034,1047,"Enhance Employment Support Programs and Create New Opportunities for Returning Beneficiaries to Work",,"We are exploring ways to improve our employment support programs to help people with disabilities remain in the workforce or return to work as quickly as possible.  Currently, the complexity of our rules and beneficiaries’ fears of incurring an overpayment because of earnings can discourage their attempts to work.  Working with Congress, we will seek to simplify work incentive policies and look for ways to minimize improper payments because of earnings.  We will strengthen our employment support programs, including the Ticket to Work program, by applying the results of prior research and using information we capture in our systems to more effectively focus our efforts.  We also will provide help for beneficiaries who want to work through the Work Incentive Planning and Assistance program.  We are committed to the idea that we must focus our employment support efforts on ensuring that people who use those supports work at their maximum capacity, reaching a level of self-sufficient earnings whenever possible.  We will encourage young people who receive SSI to reduce their dependency on disability benefits as they turn 18.  Recent research we funded, the Youth Transition Demonstration, has found that policy changes and improved employment services to young adults who receive SSI can sharply improve their employment outcomes.  We will build on the early results of our Youth Transition Demonstration as we work with the Departments of Education, Labor, and Health and Human Services to coordinate additional efforts to promote self-sufficiency among child SSI recipients and their families.  Strategies:   	Partner with the Departments of Education, Labor, and Health and Human Services to implement Promoting Readiness of Minors on SSI; 	Simplify work incentive policies and improve programs such as Ticket to Work and the Vocational Rehabilitation Cost Reimbursement program; and 	Develop return-to-work demonstration proposals.","Office of Retirement and Disability Policy","We took the following steps in FY 2015 to enhance employment support programs and create new opportunities for returning beneficiaries to work (see Key Initiatives and Performance Measures for more details):   	Initiated the national evaluation of the PROMISE project; 	Promoted the use of Ticket to Work program to disabled beneficiaries: 	 		Enhanced marketing campaign; 		Resumed targeted ticket mailings in April 2015; and 		Designed virtual job fairs to connect beneficiaries with federal contractors. 	 	 	Held a technical panel to develop a process to identify individuals with mental illnesses who are at risk of becoming beneficiaries; and 	Implemented new real-time online services to employment support service providers to assist them in providing better service to beneficiaries returning to work.   Next Steps   	Continue evaluating and overseeing work incentive programs: 	 		PROMISE project; and 		Ticket to Work.","Social Security",,,
