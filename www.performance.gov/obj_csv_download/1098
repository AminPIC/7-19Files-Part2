"Department of Commerce",6,DOC,"Foster a more innovative U.S. economyâ€”one that is better at inventing, improving, and commercializing products and technologies that lead to higher productivity and competitiveness",573,1098,"Grow a more productive, agile, and high-value manufacturing sector through partnerships and collaborations that accelerate technology development and commercialization (NIST)","Grow a more productive, agile, and high-value manufacturing sector through partnerships and collaborations that accelerate technology development and commercialization (NIST)","The U.S. manufacturing sector continues to be a mainstay of U.S. economic productivity, generating $1.9 trillion in gross domestic product (GDP) in 2012 (11.9 percent of total U.S. GDP).  Moreover, manufacturing has a larger multiplier effect than any other major economic activity—$1 spent in manufacturing generates $1.35 in additional economic activity.  Despite the U.S. manufacturing sector’s apparent productivity, missed opportunities remain where the full economic and commercial value from investments in research are not realized.     The United States excels at basic science and invention.  But the commercial and economic rewards that emerge from these accomplishments are primarily realized only after discovery—especially at the points of manufacturing scale-up and commercialization.  This is particularly true for complex, cost-efficient, high-value-added products whose commercialization requires development and mastery of equally complex manufacturing processes.     As overall U.S. R&D efforts have begun to lag that of other nations, the composition of industrial R&D has shifted toward short-term research.  These trends leave industry's long-term needs unmet and ultimately undermine the nation's competitiveness.  The Department is ideally positioned to address these challenges through its unique convening power.  It will bring together public-private partnerships that can produce cutting edge research.  These partnerships with businesses will accelerate technology development and commercialization, and strengthen the nation’s position in the global competition for new products, new markets, and new jobs.  In addition, NIST is the only research laboratory in the U.S. government specifically focused on enhancing industrial competitiveness, including a robust research portfolio concentrated on the technical challenges particularly associated with advanced manufacturing.",,"During FY 2014, the Department of Commerce (DOC) made progress in building and strengthening partnerships that will accelerate the growth of advanced, high-value manufacturing in the United States.  The Department’s multifaceted programs have contributed to a vibrant ecosystem of advanced manufacturing stakeholders, from academia to industry, businesses small and large, trade associations to state and local government.  DOC, largely through NIST, has led intensive stakeholder outreach efforts, working with business leaders to craft and oversee the Administration’s manufacturing agenda.  Accomplishments include:   	The White House Office of Manufacturing Policy co-chaired the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP) 2.0, which is the principal outreach process for manufacturing sector input for the administration’s advanced manufacturing initiatives.  DOC and the NIST-led Advanced Manufacturing National Program Office (AMNPO) served as the staff to plan and support activities for the AMP 2.0 report. This report had five working teams and regional meetings; a total of 104 leaders and senior experts from industry, academia, and labor were involved. 	NIST worked to establish the foundation for the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI), leading the interagency effort to develop policy documents on intellectual property guidelines and performance metrics for Institutes for Manufacturing Innovation. Policy documents have also been developed for the major grants management effort of NNMI on cost share, evaluation practices, visiting fellows, industry experts for proposal evaluation, and program income. 	NIST made the first Advanced Manufacturing Technology consortia (AMTech) awards in FY14, and the 19 industry-led consortia have been aggressively pursuing partnership activities.  These awards, typically $500,000 for two year efforts, are enabling specific industry sectors to work together to identify research needs for the community and develop roadmaps to address those needs, allowing a strengthening of U.S. manufacturing among companies large and small. A second competition is now underway. 	NIST collaborated with the White House through two NIST-hosted Presidential Innovation Fellows, to launch the SmartAmerica challenge to bring Industry, Academia, and the Government to show how Cyber-Physical Systems can create jobs, new business opportunities, and socio-economic benefits to America. The challenge on Smart Manufacturing catalyzed the formation of two teams on smart manufacturing and smart shape technologies. 	The NIST Center for Automotive Lightweighting (NCAL) recently commissioned a unique Next-Generation Formability System, which investigates the effect of multi-dimensional stress and strain. The NCAL is using this unique instrument to test industry-submitted samples, the results of which are shared with the Center’s industry and academic partners.      Next Steps in FY 2015:                                       	FY2015 Q1 – AMP 2.0 will deliver their final report to President in order to develop a concerted effort across the Administration to support an innovative, vibrant manufacturing sector to address the challenges of globalization and technological change. 	FY2015 Q1 – NIST will launch new calibration service for high-power lasers used by manufacturers for cutting and welding materials in order to enable expanded use of laser welding, which has lower cost and smaller environmental footprint than traditional welding methods. 	FY2015 Q2 – NIST and AMNPO will work to stand up National Science and Technology Council Advanced Manufacturing Subcommittee and develop a coordination plan to convene agency leaders in order to address AMP 2.0 recommendations. 	FY2015 Q3 – NIST will announce awardees of second set of AMTech planning awards. 	FY2015 Q3 – NIST will engage newly created Manufacturing Extension Partnership Advisory Board Committee on Technology Acceleration actively in technology acceleration strategy during first half of 2015 in order to develop action plan for engaging small- and mid-sized manufacturers in technology adoption and acceleration. 	FY2015 Q4 – If NIST receives funding authorized in the Revitalizing American Manufacturing Innovation Act, it will begin the first of a two-stage process to develop NNMI Institutes that are aligned with needs identified by industry. 	FY2015 Q4 – NIST will complete design and assembly of the Additive Manufacturing test bed that will serve as the research platform for development of in-process measurement and control methods in order to address a critical need identified by additive manufacturing industry, academia, and government stakeholders.","General Science, Space, and Technology",,,
