The program offers for sale timber and other forest products in such a way as to sustain a permanent source of timber supply while also maintaining forest health.",BLM,"Over the past four years, performance has fluctuated between a low of 70% to a high of 85% of timber resources made available for sale due to fluctuations in the housing market and transportation costs, affecting BLM’s ability to sell timber, utilize the by-products of treatments, and litigation stemming from environmental issues.  However, recent market conditions have started improving, sawmills are reopening, and bioenergy facilities are coming online.  The amount of timber offered for sale in FY 2015 was as expected, and wood products offered exceeded expectation, as a result of additional salvage volume offered from fires and insect mortality.","Natural Resources and Environment",,,
