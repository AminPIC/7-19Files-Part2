"Department of the Interior",10,DOI,"Improve the Quality of Life in Tribal and Native Communities",1803,1276,"Strengthen Indian Education","Strengthen Indian education.","This strategy initiative includes two components:  1) providing quality education opportunities starting in early childhood in accordance with tribally identified strategies and needs; and 2) providing safe, functional, energy efficient, and universally accessible facilities to enhance the learning environment.  Tribal communities need an educated citizenry to lead their governments, develop reservation economies, contribute to the social well-being of the community, and sustain Indian cultures.",BIE,"The Department of the Interior, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, has highlighted this objective as a focus area for improvement.  The Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) provides funding to 183 elementary and secondary schools serving about 41,000 students, with over two-thirds of the schools operated by tribes and the remainder operated directly by BIE.  Additionally, BIE funds 32 tribal colleges, universities, tribal technical colleges, and post-secondary schools.  In 2014, Secretary Jewell directed the redesign of BIE from a direct provider of education into an innovative organization to serve as a capacity-builder and service-provider to tribes with BIE-funded schools.  The redesign is underway in 2015 and 2016, promoting self-governance and engaging the tribe in shaping the future of its students.  The percentage of schools making Annual Yearly Progress (AYP) ranges between 26 and 32 percent in recent years; FY 2015 data is not available yet.  In terms of school facilities, growth in the percent of schools in acceptable condition ranges from 62 to as high as 81 percent, supporting education goals by providing safe and quality education environments for Native American students and their communities.","Education, Training, Employment, and Social Services",,,
