"Department of Justice",11,DOJ,"Ensure and Support the Fair, Impartial, Efficient, and Transparent Administration of Justice at the Federal, State, Local, Tribal, and International Levels",556,1333,"Provide safe, secure, humane, and cost effective confinement and transportation of federal detainees and inmates","Provide safe, secure, humane, and cost effective confinement and transportation of federal detainees and inmates","The Department of Justice is responsible for detaining persons charged with violating federal criminal statutes, provided they have not been released on bond or personal recognizance pending disposition of their cases.  The USMS assumes custody of individuals arrested by all federal law enforcement agencies and is responsible for the housing and transportation of prisoners from the time they are remanded into custody until they are either released or incarcerated.  The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is responsible for the custody and care of federal offenders and ensures that they serve their sentences of imprisonment in facilities that are safe, humane, cost-efficient, and appropriately secure.  In addition, BOP is responsible for the District of Columbia’s sentenced felon inmate population.  USMS establishes detention policy and oversees the federal detention management system.  USMS is responsible for managing DOJ detention resources, implementing business process improvements, and identifying areas where operational efficiencies and cost savings can be realized.     Detention populations are projected to increase.  The Department will continue to collaborate with other government agencies engaged in housing detainees to enhance operations and create potential opportunities for achieving efficiencies, such as sharing expertise and new innovations in detention management and exploring acquisition activities, information systems, planning models, or other operational/strategic initiatives that would benefit multiple agencies.",BOP,"Strategic Review Summary of Findings: On track and making satisfactory progress  After the launch of the Department’s Smart on Crime initiative – prosecutorial resources to cases were shifted to cases with the most significant federal interests; effectively lowered sentences for low-level, nonviolent drug offenders; and encouraged the use of alternatives to incarceration in appropriate cases – as a result of this effort and other Department initiatives, the prison population system-wide crowding has decreased to 23 percent - reaching the lowest levels since the 1990 and helping to move towards the Department goal of 15 percent crowding.  While the Smart on Crime initiative and other Department efforts have no doubt contributed to this progress, the Department is working to measure its effectiveness and impact, the full results of which are likely to be seen over a period of several years.  Overcrowding in BOP facilities continues to be a challenge by straining staff and impacting the ability to house prisoners in a safe and secure manner. New BOP facilities are constructed with more efficient architectural designs to better utilize space and are equipped with perimeter security systems, surveillance cameras, and equipment to monitor communications, which all contribute to safer and more secure facilities for prisoners and staff.  To reduce prisoner suicide occurrences, the Department developed the Suicide Prevention Training Program in collaboration with the National Institute of Corrections. The USMS continues to operate and maintains a fleet of aircraft and ground transportation assets that comprise the Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System which strives to reduce transportation costs for prisoners through innovation and the use of technology.  USMS is working to reduce time in detention from sentencing to commitment, to 53 days by streamlining prisoner transportation processing.  Insufficient modernization and repair funding hinders and challenges the Department’s ability to address the physical deterioration of correction facilities which may present safety concerns to prisoners, staff and surrounding communities, and may result in higher future costs.  To address these priorities and mitigate costs, the Department is re-evaluating contract costs with a number of vendors to assess and potentially reduce costs, validate progress on construction projects at new and existing facilities, increase the use of residential reentry centers and home confinement, and expand existing facilities where the infrastructure permits.","Administration of Justice",,,
