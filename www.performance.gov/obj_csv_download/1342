The Climate Research & Development (R&D) Program was established in FY2008, and continues to contribute many systematic analyses and investigations. The overall trend is greater productivity during years with relatively flat funding, illustrating the efficiency and effectiveness of these programs.","Natural Resources and Environment",,,
