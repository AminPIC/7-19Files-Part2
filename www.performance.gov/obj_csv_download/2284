"Department of State and USAID",14,DOSUSAID,"Strengthen Americaâ€™s Foreign Policy Impact on Our Strategic Challenges",2011,2284,"Overcome Global Security Challenges through Diplomatic Engagement and Development Cooperation",,"Today, the United States faces diverse and complex security challenges.  Hostile nation states, violent extremists, transnational organized crime, unaccountable or abusive governance, weak rule of law, and inter- and intra-state conflict all affect civilian security, international stability and prosperity, and directly threaten U.S. interests and foreign policy objectives.  To meet these challenges, we must secure the world’s most dangerous weapons and material; prevent the rise of criminal and insurgent groups; mitigate the effects of transnational crime; dismantle al-Qa’ida, its affiliates and adherents, and other terrorist organizations and deny them new recruits; strengthen rule of law globally; counter threats posed in cyberspace; reaffirm and support the balance between individual rights and collective security; and empower women to play an equal role in solving global security problems.  Many of today’s threats cannot be solved by a single state, making U.S. global leadership and multilateral cooperation ever more crucial.  This objective encompasses our efforts to counter violent extremism and build the counterterrorism capacities of partner nations’ law enforcement entities, and promote regional peace and security through our diplomatic engagement and security assistance to partner nations.  Strategies for Achieving the Objective  In order to overcome these global security challenges, the Department of State and USAID will advance the Security Sector Assistance Presidential Policy Directive (PPD-23), helping partner countries build and sustain the capacity and effectiveness of institutions to provide security, safety, and justice for their people, and to contribute to efforts that address common security challenges.  The Department and USAID efforts include pursuit of arms control and nonproliferation; reduction of transnational organized crime and strengthening rule of law (ROL); countering the drivers of recruitment and radicalization to violence; and securing cyberspace.  The Department and USAID will cooperate with other federal agencies and international coalitions; foreign governments and their security and justice services, and multilateral organizations.  Our strategy also entails cooperation with state and local partners and civil society.  The Department and USAID will balance assistance appropriately, supporting governments when interests converge and political will is present, when governments are accountable to their people and are committed to partnering with civil society for change, and as a check on abuse.  To counter violent extremism, the United States will focus on the drivers of violent extremism.","Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (USAID); Arms Control/NonProliferation and International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (State) ","Insecurity exacerbates poverty, crime, lawlessness, and armed violence, which in turn impedes economic growth, destroys human and physical capital, damages investments, and redirects resources from productive use.  At the same time, poverty creates fertile conditions for crime, terrorism, and trafficking.   The Department and USAID will collaborate regularly on broad security challenges, ROL and Counterterrorism and Counter Violent Extremism (CT/CVE) and at the policy level, work with other interagency partners to craft the Security Sector Assistance (SSA) Presidential Policy Directive.  On the practical level, USAID and the Department are coordinating on new initiatives (for example, Women, Peace and Security (WPS) and the Justice Sector Training, Research, and Coordination project (JusTRAC); field assessments [e.g., Burma, Colombia, Mali, and South Sudan]; country-specific project designs [e.g., Morocco], and analysis [e.g., collaboration on security sector accountability]).   The Department and USAID’s contribution to this strategic objective includes efforts to advance ROL; to increase citizen security and regional stability; to reduce trafficking in persons, wildlife, narcotics and other commodities; and to promote balanced SSA.  For example, the Department is currently exceeding the performance target of working with 40 partner country governments to build their capacity to address transnational organized crime and improve government accountability.  In FY 2012, USAID invested more than $225 million in ROL projects in more than 50 countries.  In addition, USAID invested nearly $175 million in FY 2013 on activities designed to counter transnational organized crime, including Countering Trafficking in Persons (C-TIP); alternative livelihood development; and efforts to counter financial crimes, wildlife trafficking, and illegal logging; and $19 million on CVE efforts.  The Department leads the U.S. government’s CT efforts and is committed to an approach that focuses on building the capacity of U.S. partners’ civilian law enforcement institutions to address threats within their own borders; countering violent extremism; and seeking to build stronger relationships with partners around the world to engage in broader, more comprehensive counterterrorism efforts that treat the rule of law as a critical part of the counterterrorism enterprise.   An example of success in forging strong counterterrorism partnerships with critical partners is the accomplishments recently announced by the Global Counterterrorism Forum (GCTF).  CT funds for the GCTF have led to the development and adoption of a number of sets good practices on a range of civilian CT issues, helping to drive the global civilian CT capacity-building agenda, including the development of proactive criminal justice systems, addressing the Foreign Terrorist Fighter phenomenon, prison rehabilitation and reintegration, preventing kidnapping for ransom, and community engagement and education for CVE.  In addition, CT funds have supported many practical GCTF initiatives, effectively mobilizing more than $250 million of new funding for civilian CT capacity building around the world, including support for the implementation of the good practices.   CT funds, along with those from partners, have helped create new international institutions that have strengthened the multilateral CT architecture: Hedayah and the International Institute on Justice and the Rule of Law in Malta, both of which will serve as platforms to promote the GCTF’s good practices.  It also helped establish the Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund; the first public-private global fund to support local, grass-roots efforts to CVE.  Opportunities for enhanced partnership include joint staff training on ROL and SSA; increased country-level collaboration on ROL and law enforcement assistance (to include assessment, project design, implementation and evaluation); improved linkages between CT, CVE and community security; and joint analytical efforts on rule of law.  In addition to providing subject matter expertise on justice, law enforcement and corrections issues to the Department and the Interagency, the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL) actively partners with state and local law enforcement, justice, corrections, and seaport organizations to deliver technical assistance and training to countries around the world.  INL currently has 86 partnerships with government entities, professional associations, and academic institutions in 27 states and the District of Columbia.  The partnerships enhance delivery of our assistance and familiarize the American public with foreign assistance efforts led and funded by the Department.  The Department benefits from the up-to-date knowledge and expertise of serving criminal justice professionals.  U.S. experts serve on short INL-funded international assignments to mentor and train their counterparts in cooperating countries.  INL partners also host INL-funded international visitors to the U.S. to demonstrate best practices and/or provide training in their respective areas of technical expertise.  They may also assist with program development and design.  Our domestic partners also develop strong personal and professional ties with communities they work in overseas which strengthens our people-to-people relationships.  The Department and USAID continue to advance the policy objectives identified in the U.S. International Strategy for Cyberspace.  In order to better secure cyberspace the United States government will work internationally to promote an open, interoperable, secure and reliable information and communications infrastructure that supports international trade and commerce, strengthens international security, and fosters free expression and innovation.  To achieve that goal, we will build and sustain an environment in which norms of responsible behavior guide states’ actions, sustain partnerships, and support the rule of law in cyberspace.  In FY 2014, the Department, with its interagency partners, continued to conduct policy dialogues and capacity building workshops with international regional organizations, such as the African Union Commission (AUC), the Organization of American States (OAS), and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), to highlight for their member states the U.S. interest and leadership in promoting an open, interoperable, secure and reliable internet.  Building off the diplomatic engagements already established, in FY 2015 the Department of State plans to expand its cybersecurity development assistance in Africa to include the coordination and development of Computer Security Incident Response Teams to better address and combat cyber threats. ","International Affairs",,,
