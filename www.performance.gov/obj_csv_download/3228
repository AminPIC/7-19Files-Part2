"Department of Agriculture",5,USDA,"Create a USDA for the 21st Century that is High-performing, Efficient, and Adaptable",1314,3228,"Build a Safe, Secure, and Efficient Workplace by Leveraging Technology and Shared Solutions Across Organizational Boundaries","Build a Safe, Secure, and Efficient Workplace by Leveraging Technology and Shared Solutions Across Organizational Boundaries","In order to effectively serve the public and deliver the programs and services to USDA customers in the future, the Department must modernize its operations and administrative support structures.  With a modern structure and workplace, the Department can more quickly and efficiently support America’s farmers, ranchers, forest landowners, rural communities and other USDA stakeholders.  In addition, by creating a modern workplace, the Department can better ensure the security of the USDA facilities infrastructure and the safety of employees and customers across the country.  A key provision to this modern workplace will be the focus on streamlining operations and creating an environment through which employees can be as effective as possible.  To achieve these streamlining targets, the Department will look across its entire portfolio of operations to identify opportunities to reduce the time and effort required to deliver its programs and services.  Through coordinated and continuous process improvements, USDA will reduce the burden on its employees and the public while enhancing program delivery.  In addition, the Department will also strive to improve the effectiveness of its employees through the increased implementation of technology solutions and workplace enhancements, such as telework.  These improvements will enable USDA to become more flexible in its service delivery and more adaptable and responsive to the needs of its employees and customer base.",,"ACHIEVEMENTS:  The Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Coordination (OHSEC) created a training video on Security Awareness in the Workplace – An Overview for USDA Employees in FY 2014.  This training video is designed to highlight general security and situational awareness in the workplace, as well as offer ways to reduce security risks and improve security. The training video is broken up into three parts: Physical Security, Cyber Security, and Personal Security and can be viewed by all USDA employees via YouTube.  Also, as a part of activities related to the Blueprint for Stronger Service, USDA established a close working partnership with the General Services Administration (GSA) to develop a “GSA/USDA Delegation Tracker” which provides USDA management with the status of a lease delegation and also provides oversight and accountability to ensure that data in USDA’s real property system is up-to-date and accurate, allowing improved transparency and management of lease activities.  In 2014, USDA’s Center of Excellence (COE) for Leasing became the centralized point for the coordination of lease acquisition and management, allowing USDA to bring 83% of leases back into compliance and keep USDA in good standing with our leasing partners at GSA.    CHALLENGES:  USDA continues to work on improving interagency communication, coordination, and program integration to identify additional shared services opportunities to improve efficiencies, and to enhance internal control systems to improve both our improper payment rates and the security of our information technology (IT) infrastructure.",,,,
