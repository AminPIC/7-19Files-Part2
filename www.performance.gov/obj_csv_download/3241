"Department of Homeland Security",24,DHS,"Mature and Strengthen Homeland Security",3240,3241,"M&S Goal 6.1: Integrate Intelligence, Information Sharing, and Operations","Integrate Intelligence, Information Sharing, and Operations","Rapidly evolving threats and hazards demand that DHS and our partners continually enhance situational awareness. As noted earlier, DHS is committed to integrating critical data sources while maintaining and safeguarding a culture that preserves privacy and civil rights and civil liberties.  We will pursue the following strategies to integrate intelligence, information sharing, and operations:   	Enhance unity of regional operations coordination and planning by partnering with and supporting the national network of fusion centers in the form of deployed personnel, training, technical assistance, exercise support, security clearances, connectivity to federal systems, technology, and grant funding. DHS will also work to enhance intelligence enterprise support to Component and state, local, tribal, territorial and private sector home-land security missions by developing an integrated set of DHS intelligence enterprise priorities specific to collection and analysis and enhancing coordination among DHS headquarters, Component headquarters, and field elements. 	Share homeland security information and analysis, threats, and risks by providing robust communications, coordination, information sharing, situational awareness capabilities, Department-level planning, and Department-level planning to homeland security partners. 	Integrate counterintelligence, consistent with component and Departmental authorities, into all aspects of Department operations by utilizing the counterintelligence program management, counterintelligence analysis, and counterintelligence support and inquiries functions to safeguard homeland security-related national security information and other sensitive information. 	Establish a common security mindset with domestic and international partners, through initiatives such as the DHS Common Operating Picture and the Homeland Security Information Network, which enable unity of effort with all homeland security partners, and through efforts to facilitate and integrate DHS’s ability to share information with key foreign partners. Note that only trusted and vetted international partners receive access to proper-ly screened sensitive information. 	Preserve civil rights, civil liberties, privacy, oversight, and transparency in the execution of homeland security activities by creating appropriate policy as needed, advising Department leadership and personnel, assuring that the use of technologies sustain, and do not erode, privacy protections relating to the use, collection, and disclosure of personal information, and investigating and resolving any privacy, civil rights, or civil liberties complaints.",,,"National Defense",,,
