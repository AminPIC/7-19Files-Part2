"Department of Homeland Security",24,DHS,"Mission 1:  Prevent terrorism and enhance security",3261,3263,"Goal 1.2:  Prevent and Protect Against the Unauthorized Acquisition or Use of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Materials and Capabilities","Prevent and Protect Against the Unauthorized Acquisition or Use of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Materials and Capabilities","Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats are enduring areas of concern. The consequences of these attacks are potentially high even though the likelihood of their occurrence is relatively low. Small scale chemical attacks are expected to remain more likely because the relative lack of specialized skills and knowledge required to conduct such attacks. However, nuclear terrorism and bioterrorism pose the most strategically significant risk because of their potential consequences. Although the difficulty of stealing a nuclear weapon or fabricating one from stolen or diverted weapons materials reduces the likelihood of this type of attack, the extremely high consequences of an improvised nuclear device attack make it an ongoing top homeland security risk.  We will pursue the following strategies to prevent and protect against the unauthorized acquisition or use of chemical biological, radiological, and nuclear materials and capabilities:   	Anticipate chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear emerging threats by identifying and understanding potentially dangerous actors, technologies, and materials, and prioritizing research and development activities including: 1) analyses of alternative technology options; 2) assessments of complex issues such as the relative risk of different chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats; 3) experimentation and operational test and evaluation of technologies proposed for acquisition; 4) detailed technical characterization of potential biological threat organisms; 5) the creation of consensus standards that enable cost-effective progress across many fields; and 6) the determination of nuclear material characteristics through nuclear forensics techniques. 	Identify and interdict unlawful acquisition and movement of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear precursors and materials by leveraging investigative and enforcement assets towards domestic and international movement of these materials and by engaging in information sharing with all stakeholders to monitor and control this technology. 	Detect, locate, and prevent the hostile use of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear materials and weapons by 1) combining authorities and assets with other departments and agencies; 2) building the U.S. Government’s global nuclear detection capability through the Global Nuclear Detection Architecture, a framework for detecting (through technical and non-technical means), analyzing, and reporting on nuclear and other radioactive materials that are out of regulatory control; 3) advancing nuclear forensics capabilities in order to close down nuclear smuggling networks, promote global nuclear security, and deter would-be nation state terrorist facilitators from transferring nuclear materials to terrorists; 4) providing unimpeachable forensic data for use by law enforcement authorities in the investigation and prosecution of crimes involving biological agents; 5) regulating high-risk chemical facilities to ensure that they take proper steps to mitigate risks; and 6) preventing the occurrence of significant biological incidents, where possible, but, when unable to prevent, stopping them from overwhelming the capacity of our state, local, tribal, and territorial partners to manage and respond. To this last point, DHS will deploy technologies that enable early detection of biological agents prior to the onset of symptoms, pursue more rapid responder capabilities, and increase the capacity and effectiveness of local public health, medical, and emergency services.",,"The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has determined that performance toward this goal is making satisfactory progress.  Introduction DHS Components implemented programs to enhance the security of the global supply chain and  chemical facilities; biological threat detection and surveillance; and nuclear detection efforts and nuclear forensics activities (investigation of nuclear materials to find evidence to support attribution of the materials and identification and prosecution of smuggling networks).  These programs have improved and sustained a reduction in the risks of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats.  Major Achievements In coordination with federal partners, DHS Components led interagency planning efforts, risk assessments, and requirements development activities to address the threat of CBRN terrorism.  DHS Components also supported capacity building efforts and worked collaboratively through training, exercises, and technical exchange programs for CBRN security issues, nuclear forensics, and risk analysis with international, federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial, and private sector partners.  As of September 30, 2014, DHS conducted over 1,000 inspections at high-risk chemical facilities and approved nearly 900 chemical facility site security plans (SSPs) under the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program.  In recognition of DHS’s work to implement and improve chemical facility security, Congress enacted the Protecting and Securing Chemical Facilities from Terrorist Attacks Act of 2014 (the Act) (P.L. 113-254), providing long-term authorization for CFATS to ensure DHS has the authority necessary to more effectively protect these facilities.  The Department’s Joint Requirements Council formed topic-specific teams to conduct CBRN assessments to identify common capability needs and challenges.  The Department also invested in technology evaluations that are shaping global standards and knowledge about equipment.  Homeland security research and development is transitioning from laboratories to manufacturers and operators including two models of handheld chemical vapor detectors and new scintillator materials ready for manufacturers to use in detectors that will improve radiological and nuclear detection capabilities.  Major Challenges & Opportunities for Improvement DHS is actively looking at the challenges and opportunities legislative authorization provides in terms of guiding the work being done within the Department to enhance security.  Legislative authority helps clarify requirements related to CBRN and may assist in engaging partners to ensure compliance.  For example, CFATS legislation gives the Department a unique opportunity to strengthen the CFATS program, but also requires a number of activities to be completed in relatively short timeframes, while continuing to implement the CFATS program.  Meeting these new requirements and developing updated regulations while implementing the CFATS program at its current pace will be a challenge.  In addition, DHS is reviewing capabilities and risk assessments to align operator training and equipment selection to ensure future operational tactics and procedures address emerging threats.   ","National Defense",486,"FY14-15 : Strengthen aviation security counterterrorism capabilities by using intelligence driven information and risk-based decisions.","TSA performs and oversees security operations at the nationâ€™s airports, screening over 650 million passengers annually, to ensure the freedom of movement of people and commerce. In an effort to strengthen aviation security while enhancing the passenger experience, TSA is focusing on risk-based, intelligence-driven security procedures and enhancing its use of technology. Since 2011, the agency has implemented several risk-based initiatives including the TSA PreÃ¼â„¢ expedited screening program; the nationwide implementation of modified screening protocols for passengers 12 and younger, passengers 75 and over, and active duty service members; expediting physical screening of Veterans on chartered Honor Flights; and providing modified screening to Wounded Warriors. Â A number of initiatives will further enable TSA to reach its goal of expanding expedited screening for known populations in order to focus on those that are unknown including the development and deployment of the TSA Preâœ“â„¢ Application and TSA Risk Assessment programs; expansion of Â TSA Preâœ“â„¢participation to international air carrier; continued expansion of the Known Crewmember program; and developing operational policies, procedures, and other activities such as the evolution of checkpoint screening technologies to support deployment of Risk Assessments that will grow the volume of passengers eligible for expedited screening. As of December 2013, on a weekly basis, more than 32% Â of passengers Â receive some form of expedited screening, and TSA expects to continue to grow that number.Â  While driving the growth of eligible populations is key to the initiativeâ€™s long term success, TSA faces challenges in aligning, planning, and executing activities for incorporating these various populations. Â The success of achieving TSAâ€™s risk-based security milestones is in many ways reliant upon external and internal partners that TSA continues to work with to mitigate these challenges."
