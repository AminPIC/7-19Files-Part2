"Department of Homeland Security",24,DHS,"Mission 1:  Prevent terrorism and enhance security",3261,3264,"Goal 1.3:  Reduce Risk to the Nation’s Critical Infrastructure, Key Leadership, and Events","Reduce Risk to the Nation’s Critical Infrastructure, Key Leadership, and Events","DHS has national leadership responsibility for enhancing security to the Nation’s critical infrastructure and protecting key leaders, facilities, and National Special Security Events. DHS reduces risk across a wide portfolio of activities, including the agriculture and food sector, the travel and trade system, and the financial services sector. These systems are vulnerable to criminal exploitation and both physical and cyber-attacks. DHS also maintains constant guard over key leaders and during high-profile events, reducing the possibility that these events could be exploited by criminal or terrorist actors.  We will pursue the following strategies to reduce risk to the nation’s critical infrastructure, key leadership, and events:   	Enhance security for the Nation’s critical infrastructure from terrorism and criminal activity by 1) identifying critical infrastructure and related vulnerabilities; 2) developing and deploying a scalable assessment methodology depending on the level of threat and the nature of the target; 3) inserting and/or developing appropriate technologies; 4) tracking protective measures of our partners across the homeland security enterprise; and 5) conducting investigations that maximize disruption of criminal enterprises that pose the greatest risk to the United States. We will also enhance the Nation’s ability to counter improvise explosive devices (IEDs) by coordinating whole community efforts to prevent, protect against, respond to, and mitigate terrorist and criminal use of explosives. 	Protect key leaders, facilities, and National Special Security Events by 1) working with partners across the homeland security enterprise to coordinate intelligence, information sharing, security, and response resources; 2) protecting the President, the Vice President, visiting heads of state, major Presidential candidates, and other designated protectees; 3) protecting federal facilities, employees, and visitors; and 4) assessing risk and coordinating support to partners during major special events across the Nation through the Special Events Assessment Rating.    ",,"The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), has highlighted this goal as a focus area for improvement.  Introduction The American way of life depends upon the effective functioning of the nation’s critical infrastructure and key resources, and the protection of key leaders and events.  Due to a variety of challenges in program execution for protective services provided by the USSS and the ability to protect critical infrastructure and improve federal building security, this goal is as a focus area for improvement.  Major Achievements The USSS continued to prevent and defend against attacks on protected persons, locations, and events, to protect the integrity of U.S. currency, and to successfully prosecute individuals conducting financial crimes.  To improve security for the Nation’s critical infrastructure, the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) published the Joint National Priorities for Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience in October 2014.  In addition, the Federal Protective Service (FPS), at the direction of DHS leadership, enhanced its presence and security at high risk federal buildings and the surrounding communities in targeted cities throughout the country by deploying staff to augment the existing law enforcement staffing in those cities to meet surge operational objectives.  NPPD also developed national and departmental policies on countering improvised explosive devices and worked with Intelligence & Analysis to publish a strategic threat assessment for the Electricity subsector.  The U.S Coast Guard (USCG) conducted domestic port security vulnerability assessments, and coordinated support for protective operations during National Special Security Events.  The Office of Operations Coordination performed risk assessments for nearly 8,000 special events (as of September 30, 2014).   Major Challenges & Opportunities for Improvement In terms of protecting key leaders and facilities, challenges in the areas of staffing, training, and protective countermeasures have resulted in the potential increased risk and decreased program effectiveness for the USSS, as was evidenced by certain protective challenges at the White House Complex.  In light of these challenges, the DHS Secretary established an independent Protective Mission Panel to review USSS policies, staffing, and operations, and to provide recommendations for enhancing the USSS protective mission.  Recent heightened threat-level events, both domestically and internationally, and the subsequent focus on reinforcing the protection of critical infrastructure and enhancing federal building security—managed by the Federal Protective Service in NPPD—has stretched the FPS law enforcement capacity and availability to conduct facility security assessments to diagnose vulnerabilities and work with critical infrastructure owners to address shortfalls while maintaining an increased security presence at federal facilities.  Highlighted Future Actions USSS has begun to adopt strategies recommended by the United States Secret Service Protective Mission Panel to address programmatic risks.  The Mission Panel recommended focusing on specific areas to improve which include:  1) conducting additional training and obtaining additional personnel; 2) improving perimeter infrastructure; and 3) improving technology and operations.  Currently the USSS is actively working to implement near term solutions in response to the Panel’s recommendations, and is aggressively pursuing additional funding and resources to achieve robust and permanent solutions.    To sustain the enhanced security and protective measures associated with federal building security managed by FPS, OMB authorized a fee increase for FPS for fiscal year 2017.  To provide a long term solution to this situation, NPPD will develop alternative operational models and a path forward that relies less heavily on voluntary compliance and a fee-based structure to enforce recommended countermeasures.  In addition, the Government Accountability Office audit recommendations will continue to be implemented to improve future operations.         ","National Defense",486,"FY14-15 : Strengthen aviation security counterterrorism capabilities by using intelligence driven information and risk-based decisions.","TSA performs and oversees security operations at the nationâ€™s airports, screening over 650 million passengers annually, to ensure the freedom of movement of people and commerce. In an effort to strengthen aviation security while enhancing the passenger experience, TSA is focusing on risk-based, intelligence-driven security procedures and enhancing its use of technology. Since 2011, the agency has implemented several risk-based initiatives including the TSA PreÃ¼â„¢ expedited screening program; the nationwide implementation of modified screening protocols for passengers 12 and younger, passengers 75 and over, and active duty service members; expediting physical screening of Veterans on chartered Honor Flights; and providing modified screening to Wounded Warriors. Â A number of initiatives will further enable TSA to reach its goal of expanding expedited screening for known populations in order to focus on those that are unknown including the development and deployment of the TSA Preâœ“â„¢ Application and TSA Risk Assessment programs; expansion of Â TSA Preâœ“â„¢participation to international air carrier; continued expansion of the Known Crewmember program; and developing operational policies, procedures, and other activities such as the evolution of checkpoint screening technologies to support deployment of Risk Assessments that will grow the volume of passengers eligible for expedited screening. As of December 2013, on a weekly basis, more than 32% Â of passengers Â receive some form of expedited screening, and TSA expects to continue to grow that number.Â  While driving the growth of eligible populations is key to the initiativeâ€™s long term success, TSA faces challenges in aligning, planning, and executing activities for incorporating these various populations. Â The success of achieving TSAâ€™s risk-based security milestones is in many ways reliant upon external and internal partners that TSA continues to work with to mitigate these challenges."
