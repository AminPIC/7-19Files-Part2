"Environmental Protection Agency",20,EPA,"Addressing Climate Change and Improving Air Quality",3328,3332,"Minimize Exposure to Radiation","Minimize releases of radioactive material and be prepared to minimize exposure through response and recovery actions should unavoidable releases occur.","Recognizing the potential hazards of radiation, Congress charged EPA with the primary responsibility for protecting people and the environment from harmful and avoidable exposures.  In fulfilling this responsibility, the Agency will review and update its radiation protection regulations and guidance and operate RadNet, the Agency’s national environmental radiation monitoring system.  EPA will also maintain personnel expertise, capabilities, and equipment readiness of the radiological emergency response program, including the Agency’s Radiological Emergency Response Team.  In addition, EPA will provide regulatory oversight of DOE’s Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), inspect WIPP waste generator facilities, and evaluate DOE’s compliance with EPA’s radioactive waste disposal standards and applicable environmental laws and regulations.     External Factors and Emerging Issues  There are several emerging issues and external factors that will have an impact on how we carry out our radiation program, including new designs and technologies for nuclear power plant facilities as well as new uranium extraction and processing technologies.","Office of Air and Radiation","EPA is on track to meet its strategic objective of minimizing exposure to radiation by maintaining readiness, both in personnel and assets, to support federal radiological emergency response and recovery operations. EPA’s regulatory and non-regulatory activities support its mission to protect human health and the environment by minimizing unnecessary exposures to radiation, including operating and maintaining RadNet, providing oversight at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), and developing important rules and guidance.  ","Natural Resources and Environment",,,
