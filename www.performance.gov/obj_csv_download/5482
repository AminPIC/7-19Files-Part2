"Department of Homeland Security",24,DHS,"Mature and Strengthen Homeland Security",3240,5482,"M&S Goal 6.4: Conduct Homeland Security Research and Development","Conduct Homeland Security Research and Development","Technology and homeland security are inextricably linked. A vast array of interdependent information technology networks, systems, services, and resources enable communication, facilitate travel, power our homes, run our economy and provide essential government services. These systems provide enormous benefits to our society and economy, but they also create new risks and vulnerabilities. DHS must endeavor to keep pace with technology and leverage research and development toward homeland security goals.  We will pursue the following strategies to conduct homeland security research and development:   	Employ scientific study to understand homeland security threats and vulnerabilities by pursuing a research and development strategy that is operationally focused, highly innovative, and founded on building partnerships among operators, scientists, and engineers, and by providing operational support, timely experiments, measurements, testing, evaluation, and analyses of homeland security significance. 	Develop innovative approaches and effective solutions to mitigate threats and vulnerabilities by: 1) providing new capabilities through new technologies and operational process enhancements; 2) offering innovative systems-based solutions to complex problems; and 3) delivering the technical depth and reach to discover, adapt, and leverage scientific and engineering solutions developed by federal agencies and laboratories, state, local, and tribal governments, universities, and the private sector—across the United States and internationally. 	Leverage the depth of capacity in national labs, universities, and research centers by pursuing a mix of basic and applied research to deliver practical tools and analytic products that increase the effectiveness of components and save taxpayer dollars.",,,"National Defense",,,
