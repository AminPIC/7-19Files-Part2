"Department of Education",18,ED,"Elementary and Secondary Education",500,623,"Standards and Assessments","Support implementation of internationally benchmarked college- and career-ready standards, with aligned, valid, and reliable assessments.",,"Office of Elementary and Secondary Education","States have recognized the need to improve the rigor and quality of their standards and assessments. With standards in place, educators are designing instructional strategies to engage students and implementing support systems to strengthen college- and career-ready skills for all students, including those with disabilities and ELs.  Results for this metric are most influenced by actions taken by states and LEAs, but also are influenced by other factors. For example, the complexity of developing appropriate assessment instruments and approaches for students poses significant challenges, especially for children from low-income families, children who are ELs, and children with disabilities. Developing and administering college- and career-ready assessments and supporting teachers through training related to the new standards will require continuing support.","Education, Training, Employment, and Social Services",4231,"FY14-15 : Support implementation of college- and career-ready standards and assessments","GOAL OVERVIEW The adoption of college- and career-ready standards is the foundation to improving educational outcomes for all students and a fundamental step toward meeting the President’s goal of once again having the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020.  The college- and career-ready standards must be coupled with high-quality aligned assessments to measure the extent to which students are mastering the standards.   KEY BARRIERS AND CHALLENGES A key challenge facing the Department of Education (ED) over the next two years  relates to the changes States may make to their currently adopted college- and career-ready standards due to changes from state leadership or the state legislature. Another key challenge is supporting states with the implementation of their college- and career-ready aligned assessments for all students, including English Learners, students with disabilities, economically disadvantaged and low-achieving students to ensure that all students are prepared for post-secondary success.  ED is taking steps to address these challenges by developing and targeting technical assistance activities that will, in part, increase state capacity to leverage limited resources and continue to identify promising practices across multiple states.  First, ED has released its Title I assessment peer review guidance, which  highlights the requirements for a high-quality assessment to help support state assessment development; in FY 2016, ED will begin conducting peer review of state assessment systems, providing examples of promising and best practices in the field.  ED will build also library of resources to assist SEAs in full and effective transition to college- and career-ready standards, leveraging work that has occurred during Race to the Top with other partner organizations such as Achieve, Student Achievement Partners, PTA, and others. In addition, ED is working internally to coordinate the provision of technical assistance across OESE, the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP), and other related offices and programs.  ED also funds a Center on Standards and Assessments Implementation (part of the ESEA Comprehensive Centers program) that helps build the capacity of State educational agencies to implement college- and career-ready standards.     ED is taking steps to address these challenges by developing and targeting technical assistance activities that will, in part, increase state capacity to leverage limited resources and continue to identify promising practices across multiple states.  First, ED has released its Title I assessment peer review guidance, which  highlights the requirements for a high-quality assessment to help support state assessment development; in FY 2016, ED will begin conducting peer review of state assessment systems, providing examples of promising and best practices in the field.  ED will build also library of resources to assist SEAs in full and effective transition to college- and career-ready standards, leveraging work that has occurred during Race to the Top with other partner organizations such as Achieve, Student Achievement Partners, PTA, and others.

Among other activities, this includes assisting states in resetting baselines and annual goals related to student performance.   EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS ED consistently engaged with Congress, advocacy organizations, education organizations, State educational agencies and other external stakeholders regarding Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) flexibility, including state plans for transitioning to and implementing college- and career-ready standards.  ED has met with stakeholders to provide information on state plans, as well as to enlist external support and technical assistance for states and districts as they move forward with implementing the new standards."
