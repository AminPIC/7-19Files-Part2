"Department of Education",18,ED,"U.S. Department of Education Capacity",504,639,"Implementation and Support","Build Department capacity and systems to support states’ and other grantees’ implementation of reforms that result in improved outcomes, and keep the public informed of promising practices and new reform initiatives.",,"Office of Elementary and Secondary Education","2015 was the first year of implementation for OESE’s new Office of State Support (OSS). The reorganization was approved in the fourth quarter of FY 2014 and OSS was created in early October. OSS is designed to provide improved state-centered support across related Department programs and offer more transparent, higher quality, and better differentiated support to meet the varies needs among states. The matrix organization model adopted by OSS ensures that a state has a primary contact within the Department and this individual serves as the liaison across key state-administered grant programs and major federal funding streams that flow to each state and district. By consolidating processes and technical assistance, the Department will be able to more effectively customize its outreach to individual states and model the critical partnerships that states should have with their respective districts.  The office is working to deepen staff knowledge and build or pilot systems and routines that allow OSS to support states with implementation through a systemic approach to technical assistance and the design and implementation of key processes, such as performance management and knowledge management, in order to ensure sustainability.  Educator equity is one area of increased attention and support during the past year. In July 2014, the Department announced the Excellent Educators for All initiative designed to move America toward the day when every student in every public school is taught by excellent educators. An EASN was set up to provide support and technical assistance to states to ensure that they had strong plans and targeted strategies so that  students in poverty and minority children are not taught at higher rates than other children by inexperienced, unqualified, or out-of-field teachers.","Education, Training, Employment, and Social Services",,,
