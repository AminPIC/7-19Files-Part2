"Department of Health and Human Services",9,HHS,"Advance the Health, Safety, and Well-Being of the American People",531,686,"Protect Americans’ health and safety during emergencies, and foster resilience to withstand and respond to emergencies","Protect Americans’ health and safety during emergencies, and foster resilience to withstand and respond to emergencies","Over the past decade, our Nation has renewed its efforts to address large-scale incidents that have threatened human health, such as natural disasters, disease outbreaks, and terrorism.  Working with its Federal, State, local, tribal, and international partners, HHS continues to support capacity-building efforts and strengthened linkages between government, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector. HHS is now guided by the first National Health Security Strategy, a comprehensive framework for how the entire Nation must work together to protect people's health in the case of an emergency.","Office of the Secretary","Please note that this section summarizes the result of the FY 2014 HHS Strategic Review process, limiting the scope of content to that available prior to spring of 2015.  Due to this constraint, the following may not be the most current information available.  Conclusion:        Progressing  Analysis:  HHS’s submission to Congress in 2014 of the statutorily required National Health Security Strategy (2015 – 2018) provides overarching national guidance on enhancing our nation’s health security.  However, there are three themes from 2014 that best characterize HHS’s achievements and support the above rating for Objective 3F of the HHS Strategic Plan:   	The frequency and variety of public health and medical emergency incidents/events for which HHS responds demonstrates an expanding mission and near constant emergency posture for some components; 	HHS has built a national public health and medical emergency response core infrastructure and capabilities by developing state and local public health capacity, building regional coalitions of healthcare providers, and preparing the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) to respond; and 	HHS demonstrated a model interagency collaboration and public private partnership in mobilizing the medical countermeasures (MCM) enterprise in response to Ebola.   While Ebola response efforts were the most highly visible in 2014, HHS prepared for, responded to, and supported recovery from a range of public health threats and emergencies.  These investments helped Bellevue hospital develop and maintain its quarantine and isolation unit and exercise their clinical procedures, protocols, and plans which prepared Bellevue to receive and monitor a suspected Ebola case in a doctor who was exposed in West Africa while maintaining regular, day-to day-care in the facility.  Likewise, a HPP funded healthcare coalition in West Virginia was poised to respond to a large chemical spill and the coalition’s hospitals, long-term care facilities, poison centers, and behavioral health facilities came together to share resources and ensure that clean water, behavioral health, and other services were made available.  The frequency of these incidents and events means that some components of HHS are in a near constant emergency posture.  Although HHS’s emergency resources and expertise can augment services during emergencies, the success with which these needs are met during and after an emergency largely relies on the strength of the systems in communities that provide these services in routine, day-to-day settings.  Emergency care requirements should be aligned with efforts to strengthen the healthcare, public health, human services and emergency management systems that provide routine care day-to-day so that these systems are able to provide appropriate care during emergencies.  HHS plans to continue to invest in federal, state and local response tools such as such as public health emergency response core infrastructure, regional coalitions of healthcare providers, and the National Disaster Medical System to ensure capabilities to meet national disaster response needs.  In addition, the Department will continue to invest in and enhance the Medical Counter Measure enterprise – a model of interagency collaboration and public-private partnership.","Education, Training, Employment, and Social Services||Health||Community and Regional Development",,,
