Therefore, it is ‘unknown’ if the remaining 28,974 Service members met CRS or received a warm handover based on the DD Form 2958 data.   WII Assigned Recovery Care Coordinator (RCC) within 30 Days:  WII Service members assigned to DoD trained RCCs within 30 days of enrollment was 100% for 4Q FY 2015.  US Navy met the 100% DoD Priority Goal by increasing the case load requirement of current trained RCCs.  15 of the 17 new hires have completed training; the remaining 2 new hires will complete RCC training scheduled for 26-30 October, 2015. ","Veterans Benefits and Services",,,
