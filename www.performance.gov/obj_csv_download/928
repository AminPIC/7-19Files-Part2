"Small Business Administration",28,SBA,"Serving as the voice for small business",517,928,"Provide useful information through digital and in-person outreach","Provide timely, instructive and useful information to the small business community through SBA’s extensive digital and in-person outreach efforts.","The SBA works to ensure that small business entrepreneurs can effectively access and navigate small business programs across the federal government. In an increasingly tech-driven economy, the SBA has taken significant steps to upgrade and enhance its website to better meet the needs of small businesses and give entrepreneurs more ways to access the Agency’s tools and resources.  The SBA co-leads the BusinessUSA initiative with the Department of Commerce to provide small businesses with an easy-to-use, consolidated website and toll-free telephone number for the many government small business resources found in other agencies.  The SBA leverages its nationwide network of field offices and resource partners to conduct outreach to hundreds of thousands of small business owners.","Office of Communications & Public Liaison, Office of Field Operations (OFO)","In FY 2015, SBA.gov averaged 2.2 million monthly site visits and 1.5 million unique visitors per month.  As a major success, given that one in four visitors access the website from their mobile device, the SBA launched the first phase of its mobile site.  The Agency also launched its Spanish language site and new content to engage a more diverse and broader audience.  The SBA has a strong presence in the field with 68 district offices providing support on lending, contracting, training and consultation services, and disaster assistance. ","General Government",,,
