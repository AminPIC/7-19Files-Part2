We must also ensure we have programs in place to strengthen our management and leadership ranks.&amp;nbsp; Supporting our managers through training, as well as with tools and resources (e.g., guidelines, procedures, best practices, desk guides, automated systems) is important in ensuring effective leadership in the face of ever-increasing change and complexity.

Training and employee development will be critical to improving the competency and agility of our workforce and are key initiatives for the agency.&amp;nbsp; We cannot afford during difficult budget times to sacrifice training and development – if we cut back in these areas, our service delivery will decline in the future.&amp;nbsp; Increasing online services will also draw less complex work away from the field offices, so we must commit to offering highly trained staff to address the more difficult questions that will come into our field offices.

Strategies:


	Ensure effective use of the agency’s performance management systems to manage employee performance;
	Improve supervisory competencies and develop talent for future leadership opportunities;
	Create knowledge management tools and processes to ensure the capture of institutional knowledge (e.g., effective use of reemployed retirees);
	Reduce skill gaps in targeted mission critical occupations to support talent development of employees; and
	Offer ongoing access to training and development resources to support continual learning.

One of our greatest challenges now and in the future is the loss of our most experienced employees.  The size of our workforce has declined by about 11,000 employees since the beginning of FY 2011 and we expect this trend to continue.  Based on our FY 2013 Retirement Wave Report, we estimate that more than 21,000 of our employees will retire by FY 2022.  A shrinking workforce affects our ability to meet the needs and expectations of our customers and stakeholders.
Changing population demographics, coupled with future staffing shortages, threaten our ability to maintain a future workforce that mirrors the public we serve.  As our Nation becomes more diverse, limits on hiring will challenge our ability to acquire talent including under representative minorities and bilingual candidates, which may affect our service delivery to non-English speaking customers.  We will pursue strategies to meet these challenges, to ensure we align our workforce with the needs and expectations of the American public.
Additionally, as we explore ways to automate, streamline, and change our business processes in fundamental ways, we will need to ensure we have expertise in the programmatic, data, and IT areas.  To ensure we maintain this expertise, we will implement employee-centered programs that foster development and facilitate knowledge transfer, succession, and retention.  We also will conduct skill-gap analyses; leverage employee skills and competencies to meet our workload demands; and ensure an environment that supports inclusion, engagement, collaboration, performance, and accountability.  Telework and other workplace flexibilities will be part of this modernized environment.
