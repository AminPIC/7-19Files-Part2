When fully implemented, our State DDS and Federal disability case processing sites will use a common system (i.e., DCPS).&amp;nbsp; DCPS will replace all the disparate applications currently in use at the State DDSs and Federal sites, many of which are rigid, outdated, and resource intensive. &amp;nbsp;The new system will incorporate additional functionality, such as decision support tools, improved quality checks, improved MI, and compatibility with industry standards for electronic medical records.

Expanded use of health IT offers yet another opportunity to realize efficiencies in the disability process. &amp;nbsp;Among other positive effects, health IT will enable us to quickly recognize if a treating healthcare provider is also one of our health IT partners.&amp;nbsp; If a provider is a health IT partner, our systems communicate directly with the provider’s systems to request medical records, confirm the claimant or beneficiary has provided an authorization for release of information form, and return the provider’s records to us.&amp;nbsp; Health IT has the potential to increase our efficiency and lower the claimant’s wait time for a decision by giving us medical evidence within minutes rather than days or weeks.

Strategies:


	Enhance our ability to share workloads among our offices to maximize resources;
	Increase process automation; and
	Expand the use of health IT.

</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Office of Systems</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>We took the following steps in FY 2015 to maximize efficiencies throughout the disability program (see Key Initiatives and Performance Measures for more details):
•&amp;nbsp;Implemented Agile practices in developing the consolidated Disability Case Processing System;
•&amp;nbsp;Implemented the national skills-based routing system to increase field office telephone answering capability;
•&amp;nbsp;Implemented data analytics and predictive modeling to identify disability applicants with severe medical conditions; and
•&amp;nbsp;Expanded our health IT partnerships.
Next Steps
•&amp;nbsp;Continue developing a Disability Case Processing System capable of processing all case types by the end of FY 2016 (additional enhancements planned for FY 2017);
•&amp;nbsp;Continue our participation in national and federal health IT policy and standards workgroups, ensuring our requirements are included; and
•&amp;nbsp;Continue expanding the use of health IT for disability claims processing to increase the amount of medical evidence received and the number of states with participating providers.

From FY 2007 to 2013, the number of disability claims we received increased from 2.5 million to nearly 3 million.  This increase equates to a growth of about 20 percent in initial disability claims.  Appeals for hearings before Administrative Law Judges (ALJ) have also increased by 40 percent over the same period.
Going forward, we will work to deliver a stronger, more responsive program to our disability claimants and beneficiaries. Specifically, we will focus on improving the consistency and quality of our claims process. We will expand our use of management information (MI) to help target services needing improvement, strengthen policy development, and expedite decisions.Based on our improved understanding of this MI, we will be able to give better feedback to our adjudicators and enable them to improve the accuracy of their decision-making.
We will maximize efficiencies throughout the disability program by leveraging technology.Our efforts will include expanding our use of health IT.We plan to increase the volume of medical evidence received through health IT by increasing our partnerships with medical networks and providers.Our heath IT initiatives will reduce the wait time for receiving medical evidence and reduce the time to adjudicate claims. One of our key initiatives is to increase the use of video hearings to help expedite disability decisions.This service provides convenience to the applicant as well as savings to the American taxpayer.
We also are pursuing a national initiative to bring greater consistency to the many disparate systems that support our State disability determination services (DDS). Our Disability Case Processing System (DCPS) will allow us to systematically support policy changes faster and make it easier to modify our case processing system nationally.DCPS also will allow us to share work across disability components more easily.
Because part of our goal is to encourage individuals receiving disability benefits to return to work if they are able to do so, we are developing strategies to increase opportunities for beneficiaries to work and be self-sufficient.  We are taking steps to create clear and consistent employment incentives, and review our disability data to identify new strategies to increase the number of disability beneficiaries who return to work.
