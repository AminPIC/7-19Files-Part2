We will encourage young people who receive SSI to reduce their dependency on disability benefits as they turn 18.&amp;nbsp; Recent research we funded, the Youth Transition Demonstration, has found that policy changes and improved employment services to young adults who receive SSI can sharply improve their employment outcomes. &amp;nbsp;We will build on the early results of our Youth Transition Demonstration as we work with the Departments of Education, Labor, and Health and Human Services to coordinate additional efforts to promote self-sufficiency among child SSI recipients and their families.

Strategies:


	Partner with the Departments of Education, Labor, and Health and Human Services to implement Promoting Readiness of Minors on SSI;
	Simplify work incentive policies and improve programs such as Ticket to Work and the Vocational Rehabilitation Cost Reimbursement program; and
	Develop return-to-work demonstration proposals.

</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Office of Retirement and Disability Policy</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>We took the following steps in FY 2015 to enhance employment support programs and create new opportunities for returning beneficiaries to work (see Key Initiatives and Performance Measures for more details):


	Initiated the national evaluation of the PROMISE project;
	Promoted the use of Ticket to Work program to disabled beneficiaries:
	
		Enhanced marketing campaign;
		Resumed targeted ticket mailings in April 2015; and
		Designed virtual job fairs to connect beneficiaries with federal contractors.
	
	
	Held a technical panel to develop a process to identify individuals with mental illnesses who are at risk of becoming beneficiaries; and
	Implemented new real-time online services to employment support service providers to assist them in providing better service to beneficiaries returning to work.


Next Steps


	Continue evaluating and overseeing work incentive programs:
	
		PROMISE project; and
		Ticket to Work.

From FY 2007 to 2013, the number of disability claims we received increased from 2.5 million to nearly 3 million.  This increase equates to a growth of about 20 percent in initial disability claims.  Appeals for hearings before Administrative Law Judges (ALJ) have also increased by 40 percent over the same period.
Going forward, we will work to deliver a stronger, more responsive program to our disability claimants and beneficiaries. Specifically, we will focus on improving the consistency and quality of our claims process. We will expand our use of management information (MI) to help target services needing improvement, strengthen policy development, and expedite decisions.Based on our improved understanding of this MI, we will be able to give better feedback to our adjudicators and enable them to improve the accuracy of their decision-making.
We will maximize efficiencies throughout the disability program by leveraging technology.Our efforts will include expanding our use of health IT.We plan to increase the volume of medical evidence received through health IT by increasing our partnerships with medical networks and providers.Our heath IT initiatives will reduce the wait time for receiving medical evidence and reduce the time to adjudicate claims. One of our key initiatives is to increase the use of video hearings to help expedite disability decisions.This service provides convenience to the applicant as well as savings to the American taxpayer.
We also are pursuing a national initiative to bring greater consistency to the many disparate systems that support our State disability determination services (DDS). Our Disability Case Processing System (DCPS) will allow us to systematically support policy changes faster and make it easier to modify our case processing system nationally.DCPS also will allow us to share work across disability components more easily.
Because part of our goal is to encourage individuals receiving disability benefits to return to work if they are able to do so, we are developing strategies to increase opportunities for beneficiaries to work and be self-sufficient.  We are taking steps to create clear and consistent employment incentives, and review our disability data to identify new strategies to increase the number of disability beneficiaries who return to work.
