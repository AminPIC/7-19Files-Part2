In FY 2013, we posted more than 251 million earnings reports to workers’ records.&amp;nbsp; Although in calendar year 2013, employers electronically filed about 87 percent of Forms W-2, we still receive approximately 30 million items on paper Forms W-2.&amp;nbsp; To improve earning records accuracy, we will work with the employer community to significantly reduce paper wage reports, moving toward an all-electronic earnings record process.&amp;nbsp; We also will increase efforts to encourage the public to verify their earnings information on their Social Security Statement.

A multi-year earnings redesign initiative is underway to modernize our earnings reporting system to increase efficiency and accuracy.&amp;nbsp; In addition, we are collaborating with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to enhance the earnings data exchanges to improve the wage reporting process with IRS.

Strategies:


	Modernize our earnings system;
	Encourage electronic wage reporting; and
	Encourage the public to review their Social Security Statement for earnings accuracy.

</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Office of Systems</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>We took the following steps in FY 2015 to transform the way we record earnings to enhance data accuracy (see Key Initiatives and Performance Measures for more details):


	Redesigned software to process Forms W-2 within the Annual Wage Reporting system (AWS);
	Processed larger volumes of earnings data through redesigned AWS:
	
		Over 22 million wage items per day;
		Over 81 million wage items per week; and
		Exceeded prior tax year volumes of 15 million per day and 72.3 million per week.
	
	
	Implemented redesign, platform changes, and business processes into earnings systems resulting in:
	
		More efficiency and consistency in service;
		Improved flow and speed of earnings processes; and
		Improved accuracy.
	
	
	Implemented systems enhancements that are expected to decrease the number of wage reports filed on paper and reduce manual workloads.


Next Steps


	Continue to modernize and streamline other major components of the Earnings Systems; and
	Continue marketing efforts encouraging people to review their earnings for accuracy.

In the next five years, we will work to maintain the public’s trust by strengthening the integrity of our programs through three strategic objectives:
First, we will continue our emphasis on accurately recording workers’ earnings.  Accurate records are critical because we calculate Social Security benefit amounts based on a worker’s lifetime earnings.  Modernizing and improving our system for recording earnings, increasing employers’ use of automated wage reports, and encouraging workers to verify their earnings are critical to our success in this area.
Second, we will intensify our focus on protecting customers’ information and ensuring maximum security for all of our online services.  We take great pride in securing the sensitive data and personal information we maintain to administer our programs.  We will implement stronger authentication measures and increase our collaboration with other Federal agencies to identify common solutions to protecting and securing customers’ information.
Third, we will move aggressively to increase the accuracy of payments to our beneficiaries.  We have always strived to pay the right person the right amount at the right time, and we take this responsibility seriously.  We will approach this objective on several fronts with special attention to our disability and SSI programs.  Our strategies include efforts to prevent and reduce improper payments, increase overpayment recovery, analyze information and data to identify and address error-prone actions, and streamline our representative payee program.
