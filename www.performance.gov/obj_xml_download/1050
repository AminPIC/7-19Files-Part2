If we are to achieve our goal to move more customers to our online services, it is critical they have confidence their personal information is well protected – we must ensure that our online services remain secure.&amp;nbsp; To that end, we are boosting authentication requirements for our online services, including enhanced security measures in the my Social Security portal. &amp;nbsp;These enhancements require users to authenticate their identity with specific information not readily available to others.&amp;nbsp; We will continue to seek additional ways to make our online services more secure.

Strategies:


	Ensure strong authentication technologies and appropriate access to information and services;
	Ensure online services have appropriate security features; and
	Partner with other Federal agencies, such as the IRS, to aggressively combat identity theft to prevent unauthorized transactions.

</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Office of Operations</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>We took the following steps in fiscal year (FY) 2015 to protect the public’s data and provide secure online services (see Key Initiatives and Performance Measures for more details):


	Expanded the use of data analytics and technology to detect and prevent online fraud;
	Applied analytical tools to our online services to determine common characteristics and patterns of anomalous behavior based on data from past allegations and known cases of fraud;
	Built a fraud business process and developed new analytical models to support the online Social Security Replacement Card application (limited release in November 2015);
	Established the Office of Anti-Fraud Programs to provide centralized oversight of and accountability for the agency’s initiatives to prevent, detect, and deter fraud; and
	Partnered with other Federal agencies to detect, deter, and prevent fraud.


Next Steps


	Continue to protect the public’s data as we expand and continue secure online services; and
	Continue to design a business plan and procure an enterprise-automated solution (tool), which will enable us to identify patterns of fraud, improve functionality with additional data-driven fraud triggers and real time risk analysis, and further integrate technology into our anti-fraud business processes.

In the next five years, we will work to maintain the public’s trust by strengthening the integrity of our programs through three strategic objectives:
First, we will continue our emphasis on accurately recording workers’ earnings.  Accurate records are critical because we calculate Social Security benefit amounts based on a worker’s lifetime earnings.  Modernizing and improving our system for recording earnings, increasing employers’ use of automated wage reports, and encouraging workers to verify their earnings are critical to our success in this area.
Second, we will intensify our focus on protecting customers’ information and ensuring maximum security for all of our online services.  We take great pride in securing the sensitive data and personal information we maintain to administer our programs.  We will implement stronger authentication measures and increase our collaboration with other Federal agencies to identify common solutions to protecting and securing customers’ information.
Third, we will move aggressively to increase the accuracy of payments to our beneficiaries.  We have always strived to pay the right person the right amount at the right time, and we take this responsibility seriously.  We will approach this objective on several fronts with special attention to our disability and SSI programs.  Our strategies include efforts to prevent and reduce improper payments, increase overpayment recovery, analyze information and data to identify and address error-prone actions, and streamline our representative payee program.
