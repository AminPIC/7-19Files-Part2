The foundation for increasing our online services is the my Social Security portal we established in 2012 and enhanced in early 2013.&amp;nbsp; Through this portal, people who register can view their Social Security Statement, get a benefit verification letter, start or change their direct deposit, and change their address – all online.

We are enhancing my Social Security to allow customers to file a claim for retirement or disability benefits, request a replacement Social Security card, and access many other services.&amp;nbsp; We will also expand the portal to include online notice delivery and offer the choice to opt out of paper notices.&amp;nbsp; The enhanced capability will allow us to communicate with customers on the status of their claims or appeals and advise them of any documents we may need from them.

To accommodate increases in mobile technology use, we will accelerate our development of applications using responsive design (i.e., applications will automatically adjust to work on any electronic device). &amp;nbsp;We will be able to deliver service seamlessly and conveniently to smartphones, tablets and laptops alike.

As of September 2013, 6.2 million people had created accounts under my Social Security.&amp;nbsp; Our goal is to significantly increase the number of registrants each year.&amp;nbsp; We are developing an aggressive, multi-faceted marketing and promotional strategy to attract customers to our online service offerings. &amp;nbsp;This effort will support yet another of our major initiatives – to significantly increase use of our online services.

Strategies:


	Expand personal services available under my Social Security&amp;nbsp;to include high-volume workloads, such as Social Security number replacement cards;
	Move our online applications under a single customer account registration;
	Accelerate development of additional online products;
	Expand the availability of online applications using responsive design and the use of self-help personal computers available in our offices or community locations;
	Provide direct access to information and notices for individuals and designated third parties;
	Offer electronic delivery of notices and an option to opt out of paper notices; and
	Increase the public’s use of self-service options by aggressively promoting and marketing our online applications and services.

Our goal is to achieve even greater success in customer service and satisfaction through innovative online self-service options.  Each year, we see greater acceptance of technology across all demographic segments and a stronger preference for doing business online.  In particular, Internet use by seniors continues to rise.  To capitalize on this trend, we will increase the number of services we offer online and will communicate more with our customers online.
Because of the complexities of the programs we administer, we will provide customer support for our online services for times when customers need advice or assistance.  In keeping with the Administration’s one-government approach, we will partner with other agencies and community organizations to offer access to more government services online through increasing use of video servcies and the implementation of Social Security Express to provide servive using self-service kiosks.
We will continue to adjust our physical office structure to reflect our online service emphasis.  However, we will remain mindful of the importance of continuing to provide in-person service for those customers whose business with us requires it.  Technology will not replace employees.  Instead, it will free them to handle the more complex workloads and the individuals who require in-person help.  It will also give our employees tools to help them handle increasingly varied and complex work.
