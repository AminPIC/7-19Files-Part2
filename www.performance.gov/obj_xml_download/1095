</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>The federal government collects vast amounts of data every day to support, protect, and defend the American public.&amp;nbsp; Data can and should be used to drive program excellence and sound decision-making within the federal government.&amp;nbsp; Data can be used more widely to help measure the efficacy of a wide variety of government assistance programs, allowing policy makers to make better and wiser choices on how best to spend limited resources.&amp;nbsp; In other cases, data can be better shared or combined between agencies to make government programs more informed and more efficient.

&amp;nbsp;

We realize that to be leaders in the data revolution, we must look to our own ways of doing business and push them forward – hard.&amp;nbsp; We cannot lead without reforming ourselves.&amp;nbsp; In short, we must practice what we preach.

&amp;nbsp;

This strategic objective includes re-evaluating the relative usefulness of the data Commerce collects and whether that data is being used to support evidenced-based program management decisions within the government.&amp;nbsp; For example, Commerce intends to use its existing data, along with data obtained from other Federal agencies, to help design the 2020 Census and potentially save billions of dollars.&amp;nbsp; Making more and better use of data will require the ability to combine different data from different agencies to create new, more useful data products, and sharing data across agencies.

&amp;nbsp;

Our customers demand efficiency.&amp;nbsp; Businesses, governments, and the public at large will benefit from the enhanced value of our data products and services and from the resultant savings.&amp;nbsp; Businesses and the public will see reduced demands for information, lessening their concerns about survey response burdens, confidentiality of data, and privacy.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office></Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>The Department of Commerce (DOC) is simultaneously advancing several initiatives aimed at making government more efficient through better use of existing data.&amp;nbsp; Initiatives include conducting a more efficient 2020 Decennial Census by maximizing the use of technology, such as the Geographic Support System Initiative (GSS-I), to reduce costs while maintaining high quality; performing reviews of the way in which federal agencies incorporate existing data into their decision-making processes; and carrying out a comprehensive content review of the American Community Survey (ACS) with the intent of reducing respondent burden.

&amp;nbsp;

In FY 2014, DOC made progress toward improvement of data based services, decision-making, and data sharing within the Department and with other parts of the federal government.

&amp;nbsp;

Accomplishments include:

&amp;nbsp;


	Commerce executed an agreement with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) under which Commerce’s Office of the Chief Economist will use existing data to assist DHS in executing its EB-5 visa program.
	The Big Data Center at Census is using big data analytics to evaluate economic impact of government funded university research (for more about the Big Data Center see DOC Strategic Objective 4.3).&amp;nbsp; Under a grant initiative with the University of Michigan, the Center is evaluating the economic impact of government-funded university research. &amp;nbsp;The goal is to track progression by university staff involved in projects and identify created companies and programs that result from the funded research.
	Commerce’s Office of the Chief Economist produced a Value of Government Data report.
	Census’ Center for Economic Studies produced Phase 1 of a program administrative data assessment project for&amp;nbsp; ITA’s Global Markets and MBDA.
	Census continued its efforts to provide the most current, accurate, and complete address, feature, and boundary data to the Census Bureau’s customers and data users through GSS-I.
	Census completed several steps toward ensuring the efficiency of the 2020 Decennial Census:
	
		Self-response and nonresponse follow-up data collection phases for the 2014 Census Test
		Systems readiness tests for 2014 Census Test 
		Reported on rate of completion in four major research tracks
		Completed draft of Reengineered Address Canvassing Recommendation report.
	
	
	Census conducted an ACS content review summit with the goal of minimizing respondent burden.


&amp;nbsp;

Next Steps in FY 2015:

&amp;nbsp;


	FY2015Q1 – Complete Reengineered Address Canvassing Recommendation report 



	FY2015Q1 - BEA and OCE provide NIST’s Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) guidance on regional impact analysis of MEP grants using BEA’s Regional Input-Output Model. (BEA/OCE).
	FY2015Q2 – Center for Economic Studies will produce phase 2 of a program administrative data assessment project for&amp;nbsp; ITA’s Global Market’s (Census).
	FY2105Q3 – Produce a report on key private sector uses of the American Community Survey data to better understand the ACS’s utility.
	FY2015Q3 – Complete 2015 researching and testing activities in support of the 2020 Census Operational Plan.
	FY2015Q3 – Complete top-to-bottom review of ACS question and content review.
	FY2015Q4 – Issue the 2020 Census Operational Plan announcing the major design decisions by September 2015.
	FY2015Q4 - Produce a final report on DHS’s EB-5 program (1-yr from signature).
	FY2015Q4 – Move toward centralizing Census’ information technology structure, CEDCap and CEDSCI.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Commerce Department data play key roles in our 21st Century information-driven economy, and every day Commerce data benefits our wide-ranging customer base – businesses, governments, and the public at large.
 
America’s 30 million businesses depend on the Department’s data to spark innovation, advance scientific discovery, satisfy their customers’ demands, and create jobs. Our state, local and tribal governments – and there are more than 90,000 of them – mine the Department’s data to warn of coming danger, position first-responders, construct high-tech classrooms, and make critical decisions on fiscal and monetary policy.  And across the most diverse nation in the world, nearly 320 million Americans look to Commerce data to understand their families of yesterday, their communities of today, and who we might be tomorrow.  Yet we can do more – much more.
 
We are at the forefront of a data revolution. The explosion of Big Data – both in the government and the private sectors – presents enormous opportunities and challenges. Businesses, citizens, and governments will use these data to expand their knowledge and make better-informed decisions, but only if we anticipate their needs and deliver. If we seize these opportunities, we will transform our aging systems into 21st Century data powerhouses. To get there, Commerce must (1) Provide more valuable data by anticipating our customer’s needs and delivering more usable data in an increasingly timely and accessible way; (2) Use and share data to make businesses and governments more responsive, cost-effective, and efficient; and (3) Collaborate with the private sector to develop new products and services.
 
This Strategic Plan is our roadmap to better serve our customers and, by so doing, make our businesses more competitive, our governments smarter, and our citizens more informed.  While remaining ever vigilant to protect data confidentiality, personal privacy, and national economic security interests, we will unleash our potential to:
 
Maximize the value of our data to governments, businesses, and communities
Make data easier to find, access, and use
Partner with the rest of government and the private sector to improve interoperability and dissemination
Collect and manage data more cheaply, more efficiently, and less intrusively
Spark innovation and fuel entrepreneurship with open dialogue and integrated feedback
 
The data revolution is here, and it’s time for Commerce to lead.
