</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>The demands for information change over time, reflecting the ever-changing nature of households, the economy, and our environment.&amp;nbsp; For instance, our economy has gone through tectonic shifts over the past several decades, moving towards a more service-based, internationally-connected, and digitally-enabled economy.&amp;nbsp; However, our data on these new, emerging portions of the economy have not kept pace.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, we are not meeting our customers’ demands for more detailed data products in smaller geographic areas, such as information on regional and local economies or their changing environments.&amp;nbsp; In many cases, the government has a responsibility to transform the data it collects into the most accessible and useable information possible to meet the needs of the public it serves.&amp;nbsp; In other cases, the government is not best positioned to fully satisfy these needs.&amp;nbsp; Consequently, many businesses have emerged to add value to available government data, transforming it in ways that help meet the vast and diverse public needs.&amp;nbsp; We want to encourage this trend.

&amp;nbsp;

By partnering with the business community and the private sector at large, we will generate new data products helping grow current businesses and catalyze the development of new businesses.&amp;nbsp; Through outreach to the business community and users, we will measure customer demand and determine what new data products to produce.&amp;nbsp; Generating these new products will be done in one of three ways, depending on the nature of what is needed:&amp;nbsp; (1) using in-house, traditional means and methods to produce new data products; (2) partnering with the private sector to couple its data with government data; or (3) providing government data in ways that are more useful to businesses and others so they can more easily combine it with their own private data resources.

&amp;nbsp;

Our business customers will be the first beneficiaries of this process.&amp;nbsp; But the 90,000 governmental entities and nearly 320 million Americans that we serve will benefit from the new data products and services that are fueled by our efforts.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office></Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>The Department of Commerce is striving to produce data that meets the needs of future society by making more weather, climate, and scientific data available (see NOAA’s initiatives under Strategic Objective 4.1) and by making necessary changes in its economic data products and services.&amp;nbsp; In FY 2014, ESA decided to co-locate the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) with the Census Bureau in Suitland, Maryland, so that the two agencies can work more closely together on collecting, compiling, and disseminating economic statistics.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, the Department has created a Big Data Center at Census, a research and testing center that focuses on government-wide federal economic data, to include GDP and labor and unemployment statistics.

&amp;nbsp;

In FY 2014, DOC made progress toward collaborating with external partners to provide timely, accurate, and relevant data products and services for customers.

&amp;nbsp;

Accomplishments include:

&amp;nbsp;


	ESA conducted a national listening tour to hear the views of state and local governments, businesses, and nongovernmental organizations on the future of economic statistics
	Completed an inventory of data gaps in various BEA statistical products
	Identified three primary areas where private sector data sources would be beneficial to improve measures of consumer spending (see, e.g., http://www.bls.gov/osmr/symp2013_landefeld.pdf)
	Participated in NYU GovLab’s Open Data 500
	Submitted acquisition package to support expanded outreach efforts
	Established Big Data Center at Census and through it began to explore big data analytic initiatives.
	Approved prototype of “Open for Business” tool
	Submitted acquisition package to support “Open for Business” focus groups.


&amp;nbsp;

Next Steps in FY 2015:

&amp;nbsp;


	FY2015Q1 – Determine feasibility of establishing a Federal Advisory Committee for economic statistics, the Commission on the Future of Economic Data (CFED)
	FY2015Q2 – Establish CFED: a group of economic data visionaries to provide short-term, medium-term, and long-term recommendations with a 3-5 month information gathering, research and evaluation period; 4 month analysis and writing; and final report by January 31, 2016
	FY2015Q4 – Explore potential to incorporate “sharing economy” into existing or new economic indicators
	FY2015Q4 – Identify and contact possible data partners to perform preliminary evaluation of new data sources
	FY2015Q4 – Continue executing plans for smooth transition and move of BEA to Suitland by July 2016
	FY2015Q4 – Based on R&amp;amp;D research with University of Michigan, build products or APIs that universities can use to augment the economic effectiveness of their research efforts (see Strategic Objective 4.2 for more about the underlying research and testing project).

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Commerce Department data play key roles in our 21st Century information-driven economy, and every day Commerce data benefits our wide-ranging customer base – businesses, governments, and the public at large.
 
America’s 30 million businesses depend on the Department’s data to spark innovation, advance scientific discovery, satisfy their customers’ demands, and create jobs. Our state, local and tribal governments – and there are more than 90,000 of them – mine the Department’s data to warn of coming danger, position first-responders, construct high-tech classrooms, and make critical decisions on fiscal and monetary policy.  And across the most diverse nation in the world, nearly 320 million Americans look to Commerce data to understand their families of yesterday, their communities of today, and who we might be tomorrow.  Yet we can do more – much more.
 
We are at the forefront of a data revolution. The explosion of Big Data – both in the government and the private sectors – presents enormous opportunities and challenges. Businesses, citizens, and governments will use these data to expand their knowledge and make better-informed decisions, but only if we anticipate their needs and deliver. If we seize these opportunities, we will transform our aging systems into 21st Century data powerhouses. To get there, Commerce must (1) Provide more valuable data by anticipating our customer’s needs and delivering more usable data in an increasingly timely and accessible way; (2) Use and share data to make businesses and governments more responsive, cost-effective, and efficient; and (3) Collaborate with the private sector to develop new products and services.
 
This Strategic Plan is our roadmap to better serve our customers and, by so doing, make our businesses more competitive, our governments smarter, and our citizens more informed.  While remaining ever vigilant to protect data confidentiality, personal privacy, and national economic security interests, we will unleash our potential to:
 
Maximize the value of our data to governments, businesses, and communities
Make data easier to find, access, and use
Partner with the rest of government and the private sector to improve interoperability and dissemination
Collect and manage data more cheaply, more efficiently, and less intrusively
Spark innovation and fuel entrepreneurship with open dialogue and integrated feedback
 
The data revolution is here, and it’s time for Commerce to lead.
