</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>American communities must position themselves to compete in the new economy.&amp;nbsp; However, communities with significant economic challenges may not have the knowledge or network needed to leverage their assets and identify opportunities.&amp;nbsp; To understand the needs of producers and attract and expand investment, they need partners and expert guidance. &amp;nbsp;The Department assists with strategic place-based investments that help create a productive industrial ecosystem. &amp;nbsp;This support includes resources for infrastructure, planning, and technical assistance to strengthen the capacity for innovation in manufacturing.&amp;nbsp; Technical assistance funding focuses on enhancing industry-required skills and identifying international supplier opportunities for small businesses.

&amp;nbsp;

The Department is dedicated to helping regional economies thrive and provides grants to state and local governments and non-profits in communities and regions suffering from economic distress. &amp;nbsp;Technical and business assistance is also provided to smaller manufacturers through partnerships between federal and state governments and non-profit organizations. &amp;nbsp;Some grants and services are specifically targeted to increasing the competitiveness of minority businesses. Through this multi-pronged approach, the Department is increasing the capacity of U.S. regional economies to produce value-added goods and services, increasing their competitiveness in the modern global economy.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office></Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>In FY2014, the Department of Commerce made good progress in supporting the development of regional capacity for advanced manufacturing economies. The Department led and participated in multi-bureau and multi-agency efforts to: support small and mid-sized manufacturing by restoring robust supply chains; strengthen community and regional capacity for advanced manufacturing; increase advanced manufacturing assistance for minority firms; and provide local resources for protecting and scaling technologies. The Department successfully expanded its footprint across the country, strengthening regional ties and providing local resources.

Accomplishments include:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;


	NIST/Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) funded five Manufacturing Technology Acceleration Center (MTAC) pilot projects in 2014 to accelerate technology adoption across US supply chains.&amp;nbsp; In addition, MEP Centers are implementing a Center-developed supply chain optimization set of tools and materials focused on establishing a coaching and mentoring partnership between a MEP Center’s subject matter experts and participating manufacturers to address barriers to effective supply chains. MEP Centers help to improve supply chain performance by quantifying the needs of the supply chain and focusing on the points in the process that are impeding throughput. Total cost of ownership is one element on which the centers provide guidance, along with executive and partner engagement and risk management.
	In June 2014, NIST MEP hosted the Grantee Regional Collaboration Meeting for the 53 grantee teams from four multiagency initiatives: the Jobs and Innovation Accelerator Challenge, the Rural Jobs Accelerator, the Advanced Manufacturing Jobs and Innovation Challenge and the Make It In America Challenge. The 150 attendees included representatives from the grantee teams from the 30 states such as Workforce Investment Boards, State Economic Development Agencies, MEP Centers, Universities, non-profits, and chambers of commerce.&amp;nbsp; The two day event provided a venue for information and peer knowledge exchange on the latest practices that will accelerate cluster and industry development in urban and rural regions for small and medium sized manufacturers, worker training, job creation and business investments in the U.S.
	EDA economic development grants made during FY 14 to help communities and regions build the capacity to support advanced manufacturing are, according to recipients, estimated to create and/or retain approximately 8,000 jobs and result in $3.1B in private investment.
	EDA, in its leadership role for the Investing in Manufacturing Communities Partnership (IMCP), coordinated the process of designating the 12 Manufacturing Communities.&amp;nbsp; EDA worked with designees on follow-up activities associated with designation, including helping to identify various federal grant opportunities, and began developing metrics to track program impacts.
	NIST/MEP delivered Supply Chain Optimization services multiple times each month, embraced by more centers and training more MEP staff. &amp;nbsp;24 MEP Centers are actively promoting these services, and they have delivered more than 50 related workshops and training sessions to companies thus far.
	USPTO made progress establishing satellite offices throughout the country. It finalized a permanent Silicon Valley lease. &amp;nbsp;On June 30, 2014, USPTO held the opening ceremony for the Rocky Mountain Regional Office located in Denver, Colorado. That office welcomed its third class of patent examiners, putting it well on the path to hire a full staff of 100 by summer 2015.
	MBDA held its National Minority Enterprise Development (MED) Week Conference, the nation’s premier event for minority businesses and the public and private sectors. The 2014 National MED Week Conference offered a venue for minority-owned firms to access information, tools, and resources to grow their businesses both domestically and internationally.
	In FY 2014, 8,353 firms received in-depth technical assistance from NIST MEP centers, a steady increase from 8,140 firms in FY 2013 and 7,614 firms in FY 2012.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;

Next Steps in FY 2015:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Innovation is the invention, improvement, and commercialization of new products, processes, and services.  Now, more than ever before, innovation is the primary driver of U.S. competitiveness, wage and job growth, and long-term economic growth.  As much as half of economic growth in the United States can be attributed to advances in science, technology, and business processes.
 
Innovation is the result of a virtuous cycle where initial advancements in technology and processes often lead to additional technology and process improvements, as well as positive industry spillovers.  It starts with the generation of new ideas that are nurtured through applied research and development (R&amp;amp;D) and then manufactured to take those ideas to scale and generate new products and services.  The experience and knowledge gained through manufacturing then leads to new ideas that start the cycle again.  The Department has central responsibility for supporting and expanding each part of this cycle and has the relationships with businesses necessary to identify workforce skills needed in growing industries.
 
Innovative manufacturing can be an engine of sustained growth and competitiveness.  The Department will increase regional and national capacity for innovative manufacturing through partnerships with state and local governments, academic institutions, and the private sector.  It will continue to be the principal defender and champion of the digital economy—the greatest driver of innovation and economic growth in the 21st century.  The Department’s convening power, regional economic development planning know-how, and statistical and economic analysis expertise will enable industry-driven solutions to the shortage of high demand skills.  Finally, the Department will continue to support R&amp;amp;D that leads to transformative changes in technology and promote intellectual property policy that supports innovation.
