</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>Treasury maintains close dialogues with its bilateral and multilateral counterparts to monitor and respond to evolving risks in the global economic and financial systems and to promote policies conducive to domestic growth. &amp;nbsp;Acting primarily through the FSB and at the G-20, Treasury encourages other countries to implement financial sector reforms consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act, to decrease the risk of regulatory arbitrage to the global financial system as well as avoid a comparatively heightened regulatory burden for U.S. firms. &amp;nbsp;Treasury also works with international partners and through the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to press for market-determined exchange rates—the price at which one country’s currency can be exchanged for another’s absent intervention by a government to influence the price of its currency—to prevent destabilizing effects on economies such as competitive devaluations of currencies.

&amp;nbsp;

Finally, Treasury works to implement economic policies consistent with the overarching goal of strong, sustainable, and balanced global growth.&amp;nbsp; Our efforts toward this overarching goal include working to rebalance global demand so that economies that have been heavily reliant on export-oriented growth generate more domestic demand-led growth, making them less dependent on the United States as an export market.

Additionally, Treasury continued efforts with European counterparts to encourage institutional development in the euro area and remained engaged with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to monitor progress toward economic stabilization in vulnerable countries like Ukraine and Greece.&amp;nbsp; In May 2015, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (Jordan) signed a third sovereign loan guarantee agreement that will help Jordan continue to provide critical services to its citizens and support specific economic reforms to promote economic stability and growth.&amp;nbsp; These guarantees, which Treasury helped to design, have proven successful in supporting Jordan’s reform efforts during a time of regional instability.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Treasury protects and supports American economic prosperity by strengthening the external environment for U.S. growth, preventing and mitigating global financial instability, and managing key global challenges.​  We promote policy positions, secure commitments, and negotiate agreements to develop existing and create new export markets for U.S. businesses and workers; manage near-term risks from financial instability abroad that could undermine the U.S. economy; press for market-determined exchange rates; boost consumption-led economic growth in surplus economies around the world; and assist counterparts in emerging economies in building sound financial systems free from corruption and economic crime.
 
In recent years, the economic crisis in Europe, transitions in the Middle East and North Africa, natural disasters that have severely impacted local economies, and other emerging global threats have all presented challenges to the global economy. In response, Treasury has worked to respond to these challenges with its counterparts bilaterally in foreign ministries of finance and central banks as well as multilaterally through the Group of 20 (G-20), Financial Stability Board (FSB), international financial institutions (IFIs), and other forums.With the help of these partners, Treasury seeks to open new opportunities for American businesses and workers, level the playing field for U.S. firms doing business abroad, develop sound international financial regulatory standards consistent with domestic reforms, promote economic stability in strategically important countries, and leverage U.S. leadership positions in the IFIs to advance sound economic and financial policies around the world.
