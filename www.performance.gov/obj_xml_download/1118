</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>Helping to increase communities’ resilience is integral to national disaster preparedness and the mission of HUD. This effort is consistent with the goals and objectives of Presidential Policy Directive / PPD-8 (National Preparedness) and Executive Order 13653 (Preparing the United States for the Impacts of Climate Change). Over the next five years, HUD will continue to support and expand programs and initiatives designed to increase and enhance pre-planning, research, infrastructure investment, partnerships, and cross-cutting coordination related to disaster response, recovery, and resilience. This work will involve the combined efforts of HUD’s program offices and federal, state, local, and private sector partners and will incorporate HUD’s civil rights, energy, environment, and diversity goals and responsibilities.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Office of Community Planning & Development</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>On June 22, 2015,&amp;nbsp;HUD Secretary Julián Castro invited 40 states and communities&amp;nbsp;to compete in the second and final phase of the National Disaster Resilience Competition.[1] These finalists—representing areas that experienced a Presidentially-declared major disaster in 2011, 2012, and 2013—will compete for almost $1 billion in funding for disaster recovery and long-term community resilience. From June to October, finalists developed their disaster resilience strategies and proposed specific projects. Through a unique partnership, The Rockefeller Foundation convened an interdisciplinary team of experts to help teams refine their proposals. HUD will announce the winners of Phase 2 in early 2016.

In addition, HUD’s Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes (OLHCHH) released the Healthy Homes Disaster Recovery Toolkit as part of their commitment under the Climate Change Adaptation Plan. This toolkit provides a wealth of resources for multiple stakeholders to develop healthy homes following a disaster.

HUD fell short of its FY 2015 goal of having 40 percent of HUD Climate Change Adaption Plans completed by the end of the fiscal year. Many of the actions proposed in the 2014 Climate Change Adaptation Plan were dependent on the availability of additional staff or contract resources. Given current constraints, the remaining actions will be prioritized&amp;nbsp; and constrained with limited existing resources.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Housing and community development efforts must address a complex network of individual, social, economic, and environmental factors in order to promote more diverse, inclusive communities and improve the sustainability of neighborhoods, communities, and regions. Many of the neighborhoods hit hardest by the housing and economic crisis—those with the highest rates of foreclosure and job loss—have been racially isolated and among the least sustainable, with limited access to economic opportunity, the longest commuting times to jobs, the most homes that pose health risks, and the poorest quality schools.
It is crucial that the federal government and its local partners effectively coordinate policies related to community development, climate change, energy efficiency, transportation, and disaster preparedness. Today we know that “place” influences outcomes—the place where a person lives is a reliable predictor of his or her long-term health, education, and employment outcomes. Families and individuals living in concentrated poverty experience greater inequity and often, as a result, more dismal outcomes.
Residents of these neighborhoods have limited access to transportation, face health hazards in their homes and communities, suffer from the poorest schools, and have the fewest economic opportunities. In many areas, the spatial mismatch between housing and transportation investments limits access to decent employment and education opportunities for entire neighborhoods. This not only impacts the lives of residents in those communities, but the resulting need to travel greater distances to connect to these resources has a clear impact on the environment as well—from wetland and open space lost to sprawling development patterns to ever increasing greenhouse gas emissions.
To address these problems, Goal 4 focuses explicitly on “place;” on preparing communities for the future of their economy, environment, and community development, through enhanced planning, enforcement, and capacity building—so that all communities are livable for residents and viable in the long term.
