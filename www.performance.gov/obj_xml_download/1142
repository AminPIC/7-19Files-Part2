</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>People are the source of excellence and innovation in any enterprise.&amp;nbsp; Treasury aims to create and sustain a high-performing and inclusive organizational culture that celebrates shared values and diverse contributions so that all employees will be inspired and motivated to do their best in service to the American people.&amp;nbsp; Treasury leaders and managers will communicate mission goals and priorities, provide necessary resources and developmental opportunities, and recognize accomplishments enabling Treasury employees to align their efforts to departmental goals and produce high quality results by working collaboratively, effectively, and efficiently.

&amp;nbsp;

Treasury will inspire excellence by supporting individual and organizational growth through continuous learning and improvement.&amp;nbsp; We will cultivate an inclusive workplace by supporting equal opportunity and diversity, and by offering work life options that enable employees to contribute to Treasury’s mission.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Management</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>Recent events, including the cybersecurity breaches at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and sustained fiscal uncertainty, test employees’ morale and ability to remain engaged.&amp;nbsp; Fortunately, 94 percent of the Treasury responses to the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey reflect that employees&amp;nbsp; remain willing to put in extra effort to get a job done and 88 percent are constantly looking for ways to do their jobs better.&amp;nbsp; In FY 2015, Treasury remained committed to fostering an environment where leaders and employees feel encouraged to focus on important principles of good government and empowered to take action.&amp;nbsp; Treasury has institutionalized a focus on employee engagement by adopting an annual engagement program cycle of data-based action planning, program implementation, and periodic performance reviews.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, the management offices responsible for individual and organizational performance management policy and implementation created the Performance Alignment Work Group to further improve alignment of individual actions to organizational results within Treasury.&amp;nbsp;

Treasury also continued to foster an environment where every employee feels equally valued.&amp;nbsp; In FY 2015, more than 200 supervisors and managers participated in a cultural transformation effort focused on diversity and inclusion principles.&amp;nbsp; Human capital issues, including diversity and inclusion, were regular topics at the organizational performance reviews and remain a top priority for Treasury leadership.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Treasury’s future success, both immediate and long term, depends on sustaining and developing the resources required to achieve Treasury’s operational mission.  Treasury will capitalize on 21st century advances in knowledge, techniques, and technology to manage Treasury’s resources as effectively and efficiently as possible, creating the best value for all constituents.
 
Treasury’s critical resources are finances, physical assets, technology, and most importantly, people.  We will invest in people by providing them purpose, motivation, support, and a fair and inclusive work environment in which every individual can excel.  We will also take full advantage of information technology to maximize the use and sharing of data to enhance sound decision-making.  We will maximize opportunities to improve its stewardship in acquiring and using goods and services.  Overall, we will produce the best value for all of our customers and the American people.
 
Achieving these objectives will demand a concerted commitment on the part of everyone in Treasury, to continuous improvement in skills, learning, processes, attitudes, and organizational culture.
