</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>Decision-makers are most effective when information and data are readily available to help them understand the issues at hand and weigh the available options. &amp;nbsp;Treasury will encourage government-wide access to information unique to Treasury to facilitate increased use of evidence and evaluation in decision-making.&amp;nbsp; By better leveraging the use of existing data across government (with the requisite controls in place for privacy and other considerations), Treasury can encourage better data-based decision-making and enable effective risk analysis, enhancing organizational resilience and risk management.&amp;nbsp; Equally important, employees must be equipped with the skills and capabilities to analyze and consume data.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Management</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>During FY 2015, Treasury advanced several leading management practices.&amp;nbsp; Treasury continued the workforce planning effort that began in FY 2014 and will focus next on the cybersecurity workforce.&amp;nbsp; Treasury also established the Office of Risk Management, headed by the Chief Risk Officer, and Treasury’s Deputy Secretary established the Treasury Risk Management Committee, which she co-chairs with the Chief Risk Officer, and introduced a more robust risk discussion in Treasury’s organizational performance reviews for leaders from different areas to surface potential risks and identify effective mitigation actions.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Treasury’s future success, both immediate and long term, depends on sustaining and developing the resources required to achieve Treasury’s operational mission.  Treasury will capitalize on 21st century advances in knowledge, techniques, and technology to manage Treasury’s resources as effectively and efficiently as possible, creating the best value for all constituents.
 
Treasury’s critical resources are finances, physical assets, technology, and most importantly, people.  We will invest in people by providing them purpose, motivation, support, and a fair and inclusive work environment in which every individual can excel.  We will also take full advantage of information technology to maximize the use and sharing of data to enhance sound decision-making.  We will maximize opportunities to improve its stewardship in acquiring and using goods and services.  Overall, we will produce the best value for all of our customers and the American people.
 
Achieving these objectives will demand a concerted commitment on the part of everyone in Treasury, to continuous improvement in skills, learning, processes, attitudes, and organizational culture.
