</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>Treasury will continue to focus on achieving cost savings for the American people, modernizing operations, and increasing productivity by governing strategically, working smarter, and leveraging technology.&amp;nbsp; Increasing the use of shared services and better leveraging strategic sourcing plays a big role in working smarter and governing strategically. &amp;nbsp;Treasury’s “shared services first” approach has enabled Treasury to manage across organizational boundaries, which has helped improve operational effectiveness and coordination across the Department.&amp;nbsp; We aim to expand shared information technology platforms to decrease cost per capita and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of commodity functions.

Treasury, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget,&amp;nbsp;highlighted this objective&amp;nbsp;as a Focus Area for Improvement due to the challenges facing shared service providers and the anticipated efforts in the coming year to standardize products and services.

In Treasury’s efforts to lead more efficient practices in government, Treasury expanded its customer base for shared administrative services this year to include the Department of Housing and Urban Development and DHS.&amp;nbsp; While this is an indicator of the high quality of Treasury’s products and services, customer feedback indicates that their needs and expectations vary greatly.&amp;nbsp; Consequently, Treasury is working to improve communications and standardize services, products, and processes to sustain the cost efficiencies of the model and improve customer satisfaction.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Treasury’s future success, both immediate and long term, depends on sustaining and developing the resources required to achieve Treasury’s operational mission.  Treasury will capitalize on 21st century advances in knowledge, techniques, and technology to manage Treasury’s resources as effectively and efficiently as possible, creating the best value for all constituents.
 
Treasury’s critical resources are finances, physical assets, technology, and most importantly, people.  We will invest in people by providing them purpose, motivation, support, and a fair and inclusive work environment in which every individual can excel.  We will also take full advantage of information technology to maximize the use and sharing of data to enhance sound decision-making.  We will maximize opportunities to improve its stewardship in acquiring and using goods and services.  Overall, we will produce the best value for all of our customers and the American people.
 
Achieving these objectives will demand a concerted commitment on the part of everyone in Treasury, to continuous improvement in skills, learning, processes, attitudes, and organizational culture.
