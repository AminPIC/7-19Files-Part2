</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>Creditworthy borrowers continue to have difficulty accessing affordable mortgage financing. Homeowners with seriously delinquent and underwater loans find it difficult to sell or refinance their homes. For home-buyers, tight underwriting standards (some FHA lenders impose additional requirements above those required by FHA) and high down payment requirements make it difficult to obtain a loan. These challenges have disproportionately affected first-time, minority, and low-to-moderate income home-buyers and homeowners. HUD will work to ensure that these under-served groups have the ability to access financing.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Office of Housing</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>FHA made great progress to ensure access to sustainable housing financing for underserved borrowers in FY 2015. Among other achievements, major sections of the new FHA Single Family Policy Handbook became effective in FY 2015 and the Supplemental Performance Metric was implemented, providing clearer guidance to lenders and providing a more comprehensive assessment of lender performance.&amp;nbsp;

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>The state of the housing market plays a large role in stabilizing our neighborhoods and strengthening our national economy. That is why the downturn of the housing market—with high rates of foreclosure, increases in vacant properties, and plummeting home values—was so devastating for families and communities alike. Although the largest factors contributing to this crisis were market driven—including a slowdown in the growth of home prices, increased high-risk subprime and predatory lending, and lax underwriting standards—the American people turned to Congress and the Administration for leadership and action in righting our nation’s housing market. Since the crisis, HUD has played a critical role in this federal recovery strategy—helping American families keep their homes and stabilizing neighborhoods hard hit by foreclosure. HUD seeks to continue to build upon this federal leadership and take a comprehensive approach to tackle the housing crisis by supporting mortgage finance reform legislation. As the housing market continues to recover, HUD will focus on ensuring underserved communities have access to credit while managing risk to the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) portfolio and doing so in a way that encourages more private investment in the housing market. This work will put HUD in a strong position to minimize the negative impact of any future market disruptions.
