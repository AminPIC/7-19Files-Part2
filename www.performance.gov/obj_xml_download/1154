</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview></Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Office of Innovation and Improvement </Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>The Department, in consultation with OMB, has highlighted this objective as a focus area for improvement. The number of STEM postsecondary credentials awarded is shaped by actions taken by postsecondary institutions, by state and local agencies through funding decisions, and by market forces and jobs creation trends. Many external factors impact this objective but the Department can nonetheless assert considerable influence to improve quality and access in STEM education. The total number of STEM postsecondary credentials awarded reflects a mixed response to the President’s call to graduate an additional 1 million STEM majors by 2020. To reach that ambitious goal, the target of total credentials established for FY 2015 was 595,000; the actual number of granted credentials was 573,911. The First in the World program, which seeks to address persistent and widespread challenges in postsecondary education for high-need students, awarded more than half of the development grants for implementation and evaluation of projects to increase success in STEM fields or that utilize education technology to enhance learning and assessment.

OCTAE is leading initiatives seeking to increase knowledge of and access to postsecondary STEM opportunities. For example, the CTE makeover challenge will incorporate “making” and “maker spaces” into CTE programs by upgrading or modernizing facilities that meet the needs of manufacturing in the 21st century. The Reach Higher App challenge will spur innovation in career exploration by empowering students with individualized career and education information. During this reporting period, the White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities held its annual conference focused on STEM and entrepreneurship.

Across the administration, the Committee on STEM Education (CoSTEM) has established a task force which is working to enhance the undergraduate experience of STEM majors through a formally chartered interagency working group led by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The group is focused on four major objectives:


	Evidence-based practices to improve undergraduate learning and retention in STEM;
	Community college efforts to both support two-year students and create bridges between two- and four-year postsecondary institutions;
	Research experiences that involve both university-industry and university-federal entity partnerships, particularly for students in the first two years; and
	Promoting mathematics success to help combat excessively high failure rates in introductory math courses at the undergraduate level.


Representatives from the Department have been instrumental in bringing new focus to the role of community colleges and articulation programs in supporting undergraduate STEM education. We anticipate that increasing the overall pipeline of candidates pursuing postsecondary education through community colleges and articulation programs will help address the decline in STEM certificates awarded.

Trends for females and minority students point to continued challenges in broadening participation in STEM. More STEM credentials were awarded in 2012–13 to students of each gender and racial/ethnic category—including Hispanic and Black—than in previous years, with the exception of American Indian and Alaska Native students. Along with the CoSTEM interagency working group focused on broadening participation in STEM, the My Brother’s Keeper and Reach Higher initiatives, as well as other targeted efforts, may help expand participation of underrepresented groups in postsecondary STEM programs.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Dramatically boosting completion rates for bachelor’s and associate degrees is essential for Americans to compete in a global economy. The President thus set a goal in 2009—that, by 2020, the U.S. will have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world. Meeting this goal will require millions of additional Americans to earn a bachelor’s or an associate degree or certificate by the end of this decade—a 50 percent increase nationwide. The President has also challenged every American to complete at least one year of higher education or career training—at a two- or four-year postsecondary institution, or through a vocational training program or apprenticeship.
 
The President’s agenda for postsecondary reform calls for a spirit of shared responsibility in addressing college access, affordability, quality, and the imperative for students to complete their certificates or degrees. Neither the federal government alone, nor any other single sector, can make the investments or create changes needed to move our country forward. This work requires unprecedented collaboration and innovation.
 
And, increased college enrollment is not enough. To advance the nation toward achieving the 2020 goal, institutions of higher education must ensure that students successfully complete with degrees and certificates. In addition, as part of its career and technical education (CTE) transformation strategy, the Department must help support state- and industry-led efforts to introduce students to careers and provide them with the knowledge and skills to enter technical fields. Furthermore, to ensure a sustainable national economy, the Department should work with the National Science Foundation and other agencies to help colleges and universities increase the enrollment and completion rates of students with degrees and certificates in fields related to science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).
 
The Department must ensure that all students—recent high school graduates and adult learners alike—are well prepared for college and careers, help more of them enroll in postsecondary education, and increase the number of those who complete programs of study with a degree or certificate.
 
Prior to entering postsecondary education, prospective students need easily accessible information on the cost of attendance, career placement and graduation rates, college loan default rates, earnings of graduates, public-service and private-sector opportunities, loan management options, and other subjects crucial to understanding the affordability and value of the postsecondary institutions and/or programs of study that they are considering. Students deserve to know that, whether they enter a college, university, postsecondary career training program, or adult education program, the credential they earn will be affordable and its value will be recognized as an indication that they possess the necessary knowledge and skills for success in the workplace and in life.
 
Providing federal student aid in a simple, reliable, and efficient manner is the main way that the Department supports college access, affordability, quality, and completion. In FY 2012, the Department delivered nearly $142 billion in grants, work-study, and loan assistance to approximately 15 million postsecondary students and their families. These students attended approximately 6,200 institutions of postsecondary education accredited by dozens of agencies. In addition, the Department administers $2 billion annually in grants to strengthen postsecondary institutions and promote college readiness, and another $2 billion in grant funds for CTE, adult education (including literacy and citizenship education), and correctional education to help adults secure the skills that equip them for work, civic participation, and lifelong learning.
 
The Department has already taken significant steps to increase college access, affordability, quality, and completion. Through the SAFRA Act, passed as part of the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (HCERA), Congress ended student loan subsidies to banks, saving billions of dollars that are now used for financial aid through the Pell Grant program and for reducing borrowers’ monthly repayment amounts. Resources developed by the Department, such as the College Affordability and Transparency Center, the Financial Aid Shopping Sheet, the College Scorecard, and a consolidated student aid website from the Department’s Federal Student Aid (FSA) office (www.studentaid.gov), now provide students and families with better tools for informed decision-making. Additionally, as generally described in FSA’s Five Year Strategic Plan for FY 2012-16, FSA recently launched two new products.  The first product is the Financial Aid Toolkit, which provides free and ready-made resources online for organizations wishing to engage students about financial aid.  The second is the Financial Awareness Counseling Tool (FACT), an online, interactive loan counseling tool that helps students and families better manage their finances and understand their financial obligations as borrowers.  FSA initiated the Integrated Student Experience (ISE) initiative to establish an integrated, customer-focused web experience for students, parents and borrowers to facilitate decision-making about funding postsecondary education.  Finally, the Department has simplified the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) so it is easier and faster for students to apply for aid.
 
During the next four years, the Department will build on these efforts to ensure that all Americans, regardless of background, will have the opportunity to access and complete an affordable postsecondary degree or other postsecondary credential.
How will we measure success?  
 
The Department will use the following indicators to measure its success in improving college access and affordability, college completion, academic quality, and STEM pathway opportunities.
 
Postsecondary Education, Career and Technical Education, and Adult Education Indicators of Success
 
Reduce rate of increase in average net price of public two- and four-year institutions
Decrease number of low-performing institutions
Increase degree attainment among 25-34 year old age cohort
Increase retention rate of first-time degree-seeking undergraduates
Increase number of STEM postsecondary credentials awarded
Percent of high school seniors filing a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)
Increase the national earnings of adults and transition-age youth with disabilities, including those with significant disabilities
Increase the number of  stakeholders, including Vocational Rehabilitation State Directors and other State Vocational Rehabilitation staff who express knowledge of NIDRR[1] grantee research
Increase the number of NIDRR supported grantee projects providing training to stakeholders on disability issues
 
What could hold us back?  What’s beyond our control?  (External Risk Factors)
The Department will encourage states and institutions of higher education to adopt policies and strategies to improve student outcomes and even out or minimize increases in the cost of tuition, books, and related items. Success will depend, to some degree, on the extent to which states and institutions (a) implement policies and programs to increase student retention and persistence to graduation, (b) accelerate college completion, (c) offer dual high school and postsecondary enrollments, (d) develop and use online, open‑source materials, (e) better align high school completion and postsecondary entrance requirements, (f) better align transfer requirements that lead to baccalaureate degrees, and (g) invest in higher education at the state level.  The Department has limited ability to influence such outcomes without new programs that are specifically structured to drive this kind of change. In addition, modifications to statewide longitudinal and other data systems are necessary to better track the nation’s progress in improving access to postsecondary education, completion of postsecondary degrees and certificates, and success in the workforce and society.  Finally, high-quality technical assistance is needed to address the limited capacity of states and school districts to advance programs in high-need areas, such as STEM.
The nation also sorely needs the reauthorization of key federal legislation, including the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), the Workforce Investment Act (WIA), the Higher Education Act (HEA), and the Career and Technical Education Act (CTEA), in order to support the implementation of more rigorous high school standards and postsecondary and adult education reforms that will increase student achievement and career and civic success.  Moreover, postsecondary institutions must increase their capacity to serve the growing number of Americans who require education and/or training beyond high school to compete in the workplace, particularly the tens of millions of Americans who have basic literacy and workforce training needs.  In an economy where state funding for higher education is threatened, institutions are struggling to serve more students with fewer resources.  In addition, many students arrive at college unprepared for college-level work. This need for remediation diverts resources that would be better directed toward supporting students’ persistence in and completion of their education.  To be effective in all of these areas, postsecondary institutions must continue to find ways to be innovative and productive in providing educational services—even as they collaborate with the pre-K – 12 sector to improve the college- and career-readiness of learners.
Historically, as unemployment rates decline, the number of young adults immediately pursuing a postsecondary education decreases.  This, in turn, potentially decreases FAFSA completion rates. In addition, other economic factors contributed to the large and likely unsustainable increases in FAFSA submissions for several cycles through 2012.  With a still-improving economy, completion rates have yet to stabilize and may affect overall FAFSA completion rates.  To address these external factors, the Department and FSA will continue to focus efforts on increasing FAFSA accessibility and ease of use.  To ensure a positive experience for users, FSA will enhance partnerships with states, federal agencies, nonprofits, and the private sector to ensure a positive experience for users.
