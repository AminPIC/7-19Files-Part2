</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>For some significant policy documents, submission of the document for departmental clearance is the first&amp;nbsp;time that key HUD policy and support offices and HUD’s Office of General Counsel (OGC) review such&amp;nbsp;documents. The absence of involvement of key HUD offices can result in a lengthy clearance process if&amp;nbsp;major disagreements exist. There are also less significant policy documents that only need abbreviated&amp;nbsp;review which go through the full clearance process unnecessarily.


To address these challenges, HUD will establish guidelines for development of significant policy&amp;nbsp;
documents that include a preclearance process and protocols for clearance of these documents. HUD will&amp;nbsp;also establish guidelines that will institute a significant reduction or no clearance of routine or less&amp;nbsp;significant policy documents.
