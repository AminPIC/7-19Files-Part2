</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>HUD's current core accounting systems have been a source of audit findings for many years. The&amp;nbsp;systems have limited functionality and are difficult to maintain properly, which increases the risk of failure.&amp;nbsp;Moreover, the current budget process has limited transparency and not all staff are trained on the&amp;nbsp;appropriate budget formulation procedures. Further, HUD’s internal control processes need to be&amp;nbsp;improved by addressing these significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.


The Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) plans to improve internal controls on financial&amp;nbsp;
management by reducing significant deficiencies and eliminating material weaknesses across the&amp;nbsp;department. HUD will also improve the reliability of the financial accounting systems. HUD will also modify&amp;nbsp;the budget formulation processes and procedures in order to increase transparency.
