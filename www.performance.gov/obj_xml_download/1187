</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>HUD’s management and oversight of grants can be more effective and efficient at a number of points over&amp;nbsp;the grant life-cycle. This is the result of a number of conditions: decentralized responsibilities and unclear&amp;nbsp;authorities, a lack of policy and process standardization across program offices, the existence of a&amp;nbsp;multitude of grant-related IT systems for identical or similar tasks, the lack of a centralized performance&amp;nbsp;reporting system, and minimal, centralized oversight of program operations.


To address these challenges, HUD will: develop a centralized, one-stop performance reporting capability&amp;nbsp;for agency grants; standardize and strengthen oversight of grant -related policies and processes; improve&amp;nbsp;programmatic oversight of grant programs for compliance and performance; and align and optimize grant-related IT systems agency wide.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Office of Strategic Planning and Management, Office of Community Planning and Development</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>HUD is maintaining reductions in the amount of time to award grants during the second year of implementation of the GrantSolutions shared service from HHS. HUD implemented a policy change to begin the process of releasing Notices of Funding Availability (NOFA) earlier. The Department has begun efforts to realign and consolidate performance data indicators for all competitive grants and is gathering input and refining based on internal feedback.&amp;nbsp;Additionally, the Department continues the expansion of GrantSolutions to automate and standardize the pre-award and post-award grants management processes across discretionary programs.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>In order for HUD to achieve its program goals, HUD’s operations must be efficient, effective, and serve customer needs. Therefore, HUD plans to achieve operational excellence by improving planning, processes, accountability, and transparency, and also by developing and using customer feedback mechanisms.
