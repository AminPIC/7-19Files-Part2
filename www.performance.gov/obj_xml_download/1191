</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>The Office of Departmental Equal Employment Opportunity (ODEEO) is responsible for ensuring the&amp;nbsp;enforcement of federal laws relating to the elimination of all forms of discrimination in the Department's&amp;nbsp;employment practices and to ensure equal employment opportunity (EEO), promote inclusiveness, and&amp;nbsp;foster a culture that values diversity and empowers the HUD workforce. Additionally, ODEEO is&amp;nbsp;responsible for leading the Department’s efforts to proactively prevent unlawful discrimination. ODEEO&amp;nbsp;also seeks to foster an agency culture in which disputes are resolved at the lowest possible level and&amp;nbsp;before a formal complaint is filed.


Currently, all managers and employees have not been trained on the overall EEO process and their&amp;nbsp;EEO responsibilities. ODEEO seeks to offer training to the HUD workforce on the EEO process and the&amp;nbsp;responsibilities of the workforce regarding Equal Employment Opportunity, as well as serving as a&amp;nbsp;resource to the program office leadership by providing direction, guidance, and monitoring of key&amp;nbsp;activities to ensure the successful implementation of the principles of EEO throughout the Department.

ODEEO partnered with OCIO to obtain dedicated video teleconferencing (VTC) capabilities to strengthen the infrastructure needed to increase the number of ADR conferences and EEO training/educational offerings. In addition, ODEEO partnered with OCIO to acquire the e-file cloud based system (I-complaints) to reinforce the infrastructure needed to establish HUD as a model EEO Program. A phased approach will allow our stakeholders to proactively track respective EEO data, as well as leverage the efficiency of paperless processing. ODEEO additionally completed performance elements.
