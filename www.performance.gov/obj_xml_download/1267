</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>Timber and by-product sales contribute to the economic stability of local communities and industry.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, since most forest health treatments are accomplished through the sale of timber and by-products, timber and by-product sales also lead to increased forest restoration and forests maintained in healthy and desired condition.

The Public Domain Forest Management program manages over 58 million acres of forests and woodlands mainly in the western states.&amp;nbsp; BLM forests and woodlands serve a variety of purposes and provide many important benefits, offering timber and other forest products and recreational opportunities that support local economies.&amp;nbsp; There resources serve as valuable wildlife habitat, and play an important role in carbon storage and clean water and air.&amp;nbsp; Using timber sales as a tool to restore and treat forests, the program focuses on ecosystem restoration and health, protection, and management for multiple objectives including biodiversity, conservation, and sustainable development for local communities.&amp;nbsp; The program also coordinates with the Wildland Fire management program to leverage funds for hazardous fuels reduction projects.

The Western Oregon Forest Management program includes all costs associated with management, maintenance, and enhancement of forests and woodlands on the public lands, including the Oregon and California (O&amp;amp;C) Grant lands, the Coos Bay Wagon Road lands, and Public Domain land within western Oregon, except for activities directly related to reforestation and forest development. The program offers for sale timber and other forest products in such a way as to sustain a permanent source of timber supply while also maintaining forest health.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>BLM</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>Over the past four years, performance has fluctuated between a low of 70% to a high of 85% of timber resources made available for sale due to fluctuations in the housing market and transportation costs, affecting BLM’s ability to sell timber, utilize the by-products of treatments, and litigation stemming from environmental issues.&amp;nbsp; However, recent market conditions have started improving, sawmills are reopening, and bioenergy facilities are coming online.

The amount of timber offered for sale in FY 2015 was as expected, and wood products offered exceeded expectation, as a result of additional salvage volume offered from fires and insect mortality.
