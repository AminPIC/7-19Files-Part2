</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>Livestock grazing contributes to food production and adds to local economic stability, and it can be used in certain areas to maintain and improve land health by reducing hazardous fuels and minimizing the impact of catastrophic wildfires.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>BLM</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>In recent years, the amount of time, effort, and cost devoted to issuing grazing permits has increased mostly due to dramatic increases in litigation when permits are appealed during the decision process.&amp;nbsp; Increased litigation is impacting performance and has led to fewer permits processed and a growing backlog in grazing permit renewals which are holding at about 20% processed annually.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; At the same time continued drought requires staff time and other resources needed for permit renewals and lease processing to be used to deal with the effects of drought on the public lands.&amp;nbsp; Grazing fees proposed in FY 2017 could provide additional resources to help increase performance.

BLM was unable to meet the grazing permits target due to drought and fire in four states (Oregon, California , Nevada and Idaho).&amp;nbsp; In addition, Idaho was unable to issue permits in accordance with the Owyhee judgement, as all the decisions were appealed.
