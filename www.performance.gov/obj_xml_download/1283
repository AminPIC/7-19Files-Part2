</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>OIA implements activities that promote efficient and effective governance in U.S.-affiliated insular areas.&amp;nbsp; OIA works with the insular areas to ensure that local and Federal funding is being used efficiently and effectively by improving insular government financial policies and procedures, financial management systems, and technical planning abilities.&amp;nbsp; OIA also equips insular area leadership with the statistical tools necessary for informed decision making.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>OIA</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>The Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) works to increase the number of insular areas with unqualified audit opinions by providing technical assistance and training opportunities.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, still only 3 of the 7 insular areas had on time and unqualified audit opinions in recent years.&amp;nbsp;


	Training: OIA provides the insular governments with continuous access to management training opportunities in the areas of procurement and contract management, governmental accounting, auditing, supervision, personnel and human resource management, leadership, fraud, grants management, indirect costs, internal and management controls, and performance and project management.&amp;nbsp;



	Statistics: &amp;nbsp;The insular areas generally are not included in the Federal collection of statistics necessary for leadership decision making.&amp;nbsp; Consequently, OIA technical assistance and Compact of Free Association funding support the collection of basic insular economic, labor, and demographic information.&amp;nbsp;



	Information Systems: &amp;nbsp;Local governments in the insular areas often employ inadequate information systems resulting in administrative inefficiencies.&amp;nbsp; OIA invests in information system improvements for critical government functions including revenue and taxation, accounting, acquisition, customs, health care and land management.
