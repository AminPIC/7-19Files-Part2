</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>The USGS provides research, assessments, maps, and data to understand and communicate national and global energy and mineral resource accumulation, distribution, and potential.&amp;nbsp; These products are provided to resource managers and policymakers to support informed policy and management decisions on land and resource use and the evaluation of trade-offs and environmental risks.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>USGS</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>Performance has slowly declined from FY 2011 through 2014 due to a decrease in funding.&amp;nbsp; However, FY 2015 performance increased despite a slight decrease in funding.&amp;nbsp; The improved performance was made possible by making more information available online.&amp;nbsp; Performance lags funding by two to three years, so performance is expected to decrease in FY 2016 and 2017 because the budget declined in FY 2013 and 2014.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
