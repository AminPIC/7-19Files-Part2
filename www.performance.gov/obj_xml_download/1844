</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>In order for innovative products to enter and compete in the marketplace successfully, a robust scientific and technological infrastructure is required. &amp;nbsp;Fundamental research at the forefront of science provides the seeds for the development of new products and services. &amp;nbsp;Strong, responsive, and balanced intellectual property protection establishes an attractive environment for innovation and investment. &amp;nbsp;Policies that accelerate the rate of transfer of technologies from lab to market bolster the return on government investment in R&amp;amp;D. &amp;nbsp;Agreed upon ways to measure the performance and quality of new products against more established technologies provide the foundations of product interoperability and allow them to compete in the international marketplace. &amp;nbsp;By investing in knowledge transfer mechanisms that are critical to growing new companies and facilitating innovation, the Department promotes regional and community capacity to generate and take advantage of new ideas about products and processes.

&amp;nbsp;

The Department plays a central role in providing the foundation critical to the growth of high-value, innovative economic sectors. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;NIST’s measurement science expertise creates the infrastructure necessary to measure the performance and quality of products and services. &amp;nbsp;USPTO programs enable innovators to accelerate the movement of new products and technologies to the marketplace. &amp;nbsp;And, EDA provides capacity-building grants to help foster an economic ecosystem in which the private sector can more effectively leverage regional and community assets to engage in commercialization.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office></Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>During FY 2014, the Department of Commerce (DOC) expanded its efforts to accelerate the invention, improvement, and commercialization of new products and services. &amp;nbsp;NIST made significant investments in expanding its capabilities in emerging basic and applied research areas to meet tomorrow’s challenges through growth in its intramural laboratory programs, development of next-generation measurement tools and standards, and new partnerships.&amp;nbsp; NIST has likewise led interagency efforts to accelerate lab-to-market technology transfer and commercialization. &amp;nbsp;Furthermore, the Patent Public Advisory Committee’s (PPAC) FY 2014 report to the President noted that the USPTO made “excellent progress in a number of areas, including Information Technology infrastructure initiatives, hiring of patent examiners and judges, and ongoing efforts to reduce patent pendency and the application backlog.”

The USPTO relies on its Patent Production Model to carry out multi-year planning and budgeting in the Patent organization.&amp;nbsp; While the specific FY 2014 pendency and backlog reduction targets were not met, the USPTO is still on target to meet the overall goal targets of 10 months average first action pendency and 20 months average total pendency in FY 2019, and to achieve a working level inventory of unexamined patent applications in FY 2018.&amp;nbsp; The Patent organization continues to work with the PPAC and stakeholders to refine quality metrics.

FY 2014 Accomplishments include:


	NIST began projects to develop SI-traceable precision measurements at point of use in eight technology areas, including quantum-based electrical standards and mass/force/acceleration metrology.&amp;nbsp; (Note:&amp;nbsp; SI is an abbreviation for Système International d’Unités (International System of Units)).
	NIST established the NIST Center of Excellence&amp;nbsp;in Advanced Materials, the Center for Hierarchical Materials and Design (CHiMaD), a collaboration with Northwestern University and a diverse host of partners. &amp;nbsp;The new center will focus on developing the next generation of computational tools, databases and experimental techniques to enable “Materials by Design,” a combination of physical theory, advanced computer models, vast materials properties databases, and complex computations to accelerate the design of a new material with specific properties for a particular application.
	In support of the Lab-to-Market Cross-Agency Priority Goal, NIST led the development of reports of interagency technology transfer metrics developed in FY 2012.
	NIST held entrepreneurship showcases at its Gaithersburg and Boulder campuses to promote entrepreneurship and innovation at NIST and to connect small businesses and entrepreneurs with Department of Commerce researchers and inventors.
	EDA invested approximately $112M in 188 economic development grants (including infrastructure, technical assistance, and planning) to help communities and regions build the capacity for innovation to support entrepreneurial efforts and commercialization.
	The USPTO made operational the Cooperative Patent Classification System (CPC).&amp;nbsp; Substantial progress towards completing examiners’ transition to CPC was made in FY 2014, with full implementation expected by January 2015.
	The USPTO made progress in implementing all seven of the USPTO-led White House Executive Actions to improve the U.S. patent system.&amp;nbsp; For example, it expanded patent examiner technical training, hosted a series of roundtables with regard to America Invents Act (AIA) trials, established a patent litigation online toolkit, and held additional Pro Bono programs.
	The USPTO reduced the backlog of unexamined patent applications by almost 16 percent since FY 2009.
	The USPTO trained 4,960 foreign government officials on best practices to protect and enforce Intellectual Property (IP), promoting meaningful, effective, and balanced IP protection and enforcement worldwide.


&amp;nbsp;

Next Steps in FY 2015:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Innovation is the invention, improvement, and commercialization of new products, processes, and services.  Now, more than ever before, innovation is the primary driver of U.S. competitiveness, wage and job growth, and long-term economic growth.  As much as half of economic growth in the United States can be attributed to advances in science, technology, and business processes.
 
Innovation is the result of a virtuous cycle where initial advancements in technology and processes often lead to additional technology and process improvements, as well as positive industry spillovers.  It starts with the generation of new ideas that are nurtured through applied research and development (R&amp;amp;D) and then manufactured to take those ideas to scale and generate new products and services.  The experience and knowledge gained through manufacturing then leads to new ideas that start the cycle again.  The Department has central responsibility for supporting and expanding each part of this cycle and has the relationships with businesses necessary to identify workforce skills needed in growing industries.
 
Innovative manufacturing can be an engine of sustained growth and competitiveness.  The Department will increase regional and national capacity for innovative manufacturing through partnerships with state and local governments, academic institutions, and the private sector.  It will continue to be the principal defender and champion of the digital economy—the greatest driver of innovation and economic growth in the 21st century.  The Department’s convening power, regional economic development planning know-how, and statistical and economic analysis expertise will enable industry-driven solutions to the shortage of high demand skills.  Finally, the Department will continue to support R&amp;amp;D that leads to transformative changes in technology and promote intellectual property policy that supports innovation.
