</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>USDA employees work on the frontlines every day, whether it is through battling wildfires or ensuring the safety of our Nation’s food supply, to serve the country and its taxpayers.&amp;nbsp; Since the employees are responsible for providing these services, it is imperative that the workforce is equipped with the skills and abilities to effectively and efficiently carry out the Department’s responsibilities.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; To effectively develop the workforce, therefore, USDA is focusing on ensuring that the skills and competencies of its employees are appropriately assessed and improved upon.&amp;nbsp; At the same time, the Department is striving to institute an inclusive and high-performing culture that not only values the differences offered by a diverse workforce, but also leverages those differences to better serve the Department’s customers.&amp;nbsp; To further improve performance, the Department is striving to engage its workforce in the development and implementation of innovative solutions to the challenges of today.

</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office></Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>ACHIEVEMENTS:&amp;nbsp; USDA employees work on the frontlines every day to serve the country and its taxpayers, whether it is through battling wildfires or ensuring the safety of our Nation’s food supply. Because of the important work done by our employees, it is imperative that the workforce be equipped with the skills and abilities to effectively and efficiently carry out the Department’s responsibilities. Part of ensuring a high-performing workforce is an engaged workforce. USDA made some progress with regard to employee engagement seeing an increase in its Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey results in 2015. USDA ranked high in areas related to “Effective Leadership: Supervisors” and “Employee Skills-Mission Match,” and ranked third highest among large agencies in its “Support for Diversity.”

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>With over 100,000 employees located across the country and around the world, USDA faces challenges in managing and supporting a workforce responsible for a broad array of programs and services for the public.  At the same time, however, USDA has tremendous opportunities to leverage this workforce to increase the value of USDA activities to taxpayers by building a modern workforce and modern workplace.
Through the Blueprint for Stronger Service, USDA is striving to build itself as a Department for the 21st century by leveraging technology enhancements; reducing operating costs and increasing efficiencies; investing in a flexible, results-oriented workforce; and effectively managing limited resources in an ever-tightening budget environment.
USDA’s efforts under this strategic goal will result in a Department that is recognized as top place to work in Government that respects the rights of its employees and customers and actively works to improve its stewardship of taxpayer resources.   By investing in its workforce while holding leadership and employees accountable for delivering results and ensuring that effective programs and services are being made available to new and existing customers, USDA will increase its value to taxpayers for years to come.
