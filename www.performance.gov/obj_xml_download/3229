</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>In order to become a truly modern organization, the Department will need to improve the efficiency and efficacy with which it utilizes taxpayer resources to deliver services to the public.&amp;nbsp; Intrinsic to these improvements will be an enhanced focus on being good stewards of the financial and property resources entrusted to the Department.&amp;nbsp; Key to such stewardship will be a continued focus of the Department on the accuracy of payments being made through USDA programs.&amp;nbsp; USDA will continue to strive to reduce its rate of improper payments to ensure that the program resources are being received by the intended recipients.

To also improve its program delivery, the Department will focus on expanding its use of performance data and program evaluation results to drive decisions.&amp;nbsp; Information derived from these evaluations will focus on identifying areas for improvement and opportunities for applying limited resources to improving the quality of service provided by USDA programs.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office></Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>ACHIEVEMENTS:&amp;nbsp; USDA’s Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) established an enterprise management initiative, to complement their Capital Planning and Investment Control process.&amp;nbsp; The goal of this initiative is to develop a strategic sourcing program to support enterprise contracting, customer marketing, and vendor management, and to achieve the maximum return on taxpayer investment for information technology (IT) investments.&amp;nbsp;

Also, During FY 2015, USDA agencies and offices engaged in a number of efforts to reduce the Department’s National space footprint. These efforts included a number of co-location activities intended to reduce the Department’s overall footprint by sharing space amongst USDA organizations.

CHALLENGES:&amp;nbsp; USDA continues to work on improving interagency communication, coordination, and program integration to identify additional shared services opportunities to improve efficiencies and to enhance internal control systems to improve both our improper payment rates and IT security infrastructure.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>With over 100,000 employees located across the country and around the world, USDA faces challenges in managing and supporting a workforce responsible for a broad array of programs and services for the public.  At the same time, however, USDA has tremendous opportunities to leverage this workforce to increase the value of USDA activities to taxpayers by building a modern workforce and modern workplace.
Through the Blueprint for Stronger Service, USDA is striving to build itself as a Department for the 21st century by leveraging technology enhancements; reducing operating costs and increasing efficiencies; investing in a flexible, results-oriented workforce; and effectively managing limited resources in an ever-tightening budget environment.
USDA’s efforts under this strategic goal will result in a Department that is recognized as top place to work in Government that respects the rights of its employees and customers and actively works to improve its stewardship of taxpayer resources.   By investing in its workforce while holding leadership and employees accountable for delivering results and ensuring that effective programs and services are being made available to new and existing customers, USDA will increase its value to taxpayers for years to come.
