</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>DHS operates within a dynamic environment at home and abroad. The inherently transnational nature of homeland security missions necessitates a strong DHS international affairs enterprise that provides compatible visions of homeland security globally, a consistent and mutually beneficial cooperation with foreign partners, and an international footprint that maximizes mission effectiveness and return on investment.

We will pursue the following strategies to strengthen the DHS international affairs enterprise in support of homeland security missions:


	Establish strategic priorities for the Department’s international affairs enterprise by engaging across Components in areas including policy analysis, cross-regional coordination, and management of international affairs issues, to establish a single, accepted view of DHS international operations and engagements. Implementation plans will be developed to responsibly document how DHS Components will implement these strategic priorities in a unified manner.
	Establish coordination and communication mechanisms across the DHS international affairs enterprise to ensure national, Departmental and Component priorities are synchronized and DHS’s international engagements are fully utilized to achieve common objectives.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>The Nation’s experiences in the years since September 11, 2001 highlight the importance of joining efforts across all levels of society and government into a common homeland security. In considering the evolution of the Department and the ever-changing environment in which it operates, we have identified several key, cross-cutting functional areas of focus for action within the Department that must be accomplished in order for it to successfully execute its core missions. These functions, and the critical activities associated with them, serve as the supporting foundation that underpins all homeland security missions.
These goals also support the Unity of Effort Initiative, which builds important linkages between the Department’s planning, programming, budgeting, and execution processes, ensuring that the Department invests and operates in a cohesive, unified fashion, and makes decisions that are transparent and collaborative to drive the Secretary’s strategic guidance to results.
