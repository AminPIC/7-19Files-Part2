</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>DHS is uniquely positioned not only to support communities during a disaster, but also to enable partners to take steps that will decrease risk and mitigate future hazards before a disaster strikes. While risk cannot be totally eliminated, DHS can influence and support more positive outcomes in reducing risks. National risk management emphasizes focusing on those actions and interventions that reduce the greatest amount of strategic risk to the Nation.

We will pursue the following strategies to mitigate hazards and vulnerabilities:


	Promote public and private sector awareness and understanding of community-specific risks by providing credible and actionable data and tools to support risk-informed decision making and incentivizing and facilitating investments to manage current and future risk.
	Reduce vulnerability through standards, regulation, resilient design, effective mitigation, and disaster risk reduction measures by encouraging appropriate land use and adoption of building codes, while also applying engineering and planning practices in conjunction with advanced technology tools.
	Prevent maritime incidents by establishing, and ensuring compliance with standards and regulations by licensing U.S. mariners, conducting and sharing findings of casualty investi-gations, and providing grants and support for government and nongovernment boating safety efforts.

Introduction
DHS is uniquely positioned not only to support communities during a disaster, but also to enable partners to take steps that will decrease risk and mitigate future hazards before a disaster strikes.&amp;nbsp; While risk cannot be totally eliminated, DHS can influence and support more positive outcomes in reducing risks by:&amp;nbsp; mitigating hazards and vulnerabilities by promoting public and private sector awareness and understanding of community-specific risk; reducing vulnerability through effective mitigation and disaster risk reduction measures; and preventing maritime incidents by establishing, and ensuring compliance with, standards and regulations.

Major Achievements
As of September 30, 2014, more households and communities are taking steps to mitigate property damage and adopt disaster-resistant building codes than in previous years.&amp;nbsp; Maritime mitigation efforts included screening 212,000 vessels, 30 million vessel crewmembers &amp;amp; passengers, and updating the 43 Area Maritime Security Plans to assess cyber vulnerabilities and marine transportation system recovery capacities.&amp;nbsp; These efforts ensured the 5-year average number of chemical discharge incidents, oil spills, and commercial mariner and recreational boating deaths and injuries all were reduced.

The implementation of SUMMIT&amp;nbsp; software by FEMA allowed responders and decision makers to access the nation’s modeling &amp;amp; simulation resources to analyze and prepare for incidents.&amp;nbsp; The Mitigation Framework Leadership Group developed a Federal Flood Risk Management Standard to ensure federally-funded projects are built to account for flood risk.&amp;nbsp; Other flood mitigation actions included: expansion of FEMA’s flood mapping program (Risk MAP) to cover 53 percent of the U.S. population, a new test tunnel for testing inflatable tunnel plug prototypes designed to prevent flooding in mass transit systems, development of an APEX Flood Program implementation strategy to increase community resilience, and 25 pilot programs to provide accurate assessments of communities’ flood risks.&amp;nbsp;

Major Challenges &amp;amp; Opportunities for Improvement
Though DHS made advances in mitigating hazards and vulnerabilities, significant challenges lie ahead.&amp;nbsp; The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) currently owes the U.S. Department of the Treasury $23 billion.&amp;nbsp; DHS will consider changes to address both the sustainability and affordability of the NFIP for the 2017 reauthorization of the program.&amp;nbsp;

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Despite ongoing vigilance and efforts to protect the United States and its citizens, major accidents, disruptions, and natural disasters, as well as deliberate attacks, will occur. The challenge is to build the capacity of American society to be resilient in the face of disruptions, disasters, and other crises. Our goals in this mission require us to: 1) enhance national preparedness; 2) mitigate hazards and vulnerabilities; 3) ensure effective emergency response; and 4) enable rapid recovery.
The 2014 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review reaffirms the Whole Community approach to national preparedness and resilience, which calls for the investment of everyone – not just the government – in preparedness efforts. Whole Community is a means by which emergency managers, organizational and community leaders, government officials, private and nonprofit sectors, faith-based and disability organizations, and the general public can collectively understand and assess the needs of their respective communities as well as determine the best ways to organize and strengthen their assets, capacities, and interests.

In addition, states and territories assess their current capability and set targets for improvement for preventing, protecting against, mitigating, responding to, and recovering from these threats and hazards. FEMA expects states and territories to mature and demonstrate improvement towards achieving their capability targets over the next two years through their THIRAs.
