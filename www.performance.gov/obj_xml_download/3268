</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Diversity and Inclusion </Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>In FY 2015, OPM integrated a career mapping tool into the Learning Management System, which allows employees to understand the competencies and requirements for entry or advancement within various occupations and supports their career planning; supported employees by creating an OPM Mentoring program, providing mentoring orientation sessions and ultimately pairing 27 mentor and mentees; developed and delivered instructor-led courses in OPM's cross-cutting core competencies (problem solving, customer service, data analytics, and oral and written communications) to help ensure all employees are proficient in these core areas; developed a Lean Six Sigma process improvement certification framework that supports the dissemination of Lean Six Sigma techniques across functional operations; and launched the pilot of OPM Connect, a workforce agility project that allows employees to contribute to projects that may be outside of their normal duties, but which support Agency mission and embrace innovation.

&amp;nbsp;

Over the past few years, OPM has shifted its approach to learning and development from entirely decentralized to a more corporate approach.&amp;nbsp; The agency continues to reevaluate and rebalance this function and the associated funding to ensure the workforce has the skills needed to accomplish the agency’s mission.&amp;nbsp; Certain functions, such as internal training and development policy and management of the learning management system, are consistently centralized.&amp;nbsp; With limited funds for training delivery, however, there is tension between the need for specific, technical skills in each organization, and the need for broader competencies, like customer service, that support agency-wide success.&amp;nbsp; OPM’s senior leadership team will continue to work together to identify corporate learning priorities and determine the appropriate balance between corporate and decentralized learning priorities.&amp;nbsp;

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Evidence demonstrates that organizations with a greater percentage of engaged employees outperform those with a lower percentage of engaged employees and engaged employees are demonstrably more productive than their less engaged colleagues.1 OPM’s performance is largely dependent on the performance of its employees. OPM products and services – whether policy analysis or claims processing - are labor intensive. In order to attract and engage a diverse and effective OPM Workforce, we must invest in our most valuable resource – our employees. It is critical we make these investments in our people in order to achieve our mission.
