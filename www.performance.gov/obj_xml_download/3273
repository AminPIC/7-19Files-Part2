	Communicating key topics (inclusion, engagement, telework) on multiple platforms.
	Keeping customers abreast of legal changes.
	Ensuring that all HR information systems across the Federal government are aligned with OPM policy and guidance.

</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office></Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>To support Strategy 2.04, OPM provided a complement of webinar trainings that it recorded and made available for the HR Community on OPM’s YouTube Channel, the HRU website, and the OPM website. The webcasts included titles such as Processing Phased Retirement, TSP Transfers and Rollovers: How, When, and Why (or Why Not!), and Overview of Federal Employees Insurance Benefits. The webinars are available at http://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/benefits-officerscenter. Participation in the webcasts has been high. Webinars delivered in FY 2015 received more than 20,000 views.&amp;nbsp; As they are hosted online, they continue to provide training to benefits officers on key topics related to retirement and insurance. OPM also provided an in-person training class to the Department of Energy on Federal Erroneous Retirement Coverage Corrections.

&amp;nbsp;

The three virtual seminars referenced in 2.03 also support Strategy 2.04. The Virtual Benefits Officers seminars covered benefits initiatives, shared best practices, and discussed crosscutting issues in retirement, insurance, and Thrift Savings Plan administration. The event also featured information on OPM’s Retirement Audit initiative and how to provide a healthy retirement case to OPM. The Virtual HR Training Conference covered a wide variety of Federal HR and human capital issues, strategies and promising practices including recruitment, engagement, diversity and inclusion, and many more topics. This conference offered tracks for “Back-to-Basics,” “Hiring Process,” “Strategic HC Management”, “HR Innovations,”&amp;nbsp; and “Hiring Managers.”

&amp;nbsp;

OPM also participated in a Customer Experience Summit with OMB, Social Security Administration, and other Federal organizations to share best practices on Raising the Management Bar and The Transformative Power of Technology.

&amp;nbsp;

A challenge to the implementation of this strategy will be the ability to communicate policy and procedure information in language understandable by HR specialists, Federal employees and retirees, the public, and OPM’s other customers.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>OPM has a diverse set of customers that include Federal employees, retirees, Federal human resource professionals, Federal agencies, uninsured Americans, and job applicants. While it may not be possible to have a single approach to customer service to meet the diverse needs of such a wide range of customers, OPM’s customer-facing components stand to gain much from sharing information and strategies with one another. The bottom line is that OPM’s customers should expect a consistently high standard of service quality.  Achieving success in this area will go a long way toward establishing an OPM brand that we all can be proud of.
