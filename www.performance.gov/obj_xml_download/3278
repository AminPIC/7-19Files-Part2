</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office></Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>OPM launched the USA Staffing® system upgrade, which supports recruitment data standards for reporting and systems integration.&amp;nbsp; The agency also implemented USA Staffing® customer data delivery through standard, ad hoc reporting, and data self-service.&amp;nbsp; OPM will further expand the business availability of recruitment and staffing data with a data warehouse, which the agency will build with recruitment and staffing data standards aligned to OPM’s enterprise architecture.

OPM successfully launched basic data analytics training as an online course available to all employees.&amp;nbsp; Also in FY 2015, OPM procured contractor support to develop decision making training, which the agency launched in September 2015.&amp;nbsp; The contractor will also provide advanced data analytics training for execution in FY 2016, with the potential for further development of a certification program in data analytics for OPM employees.

&amp;nbsp;

A challenge with the medium of delivery is that it is self-paced, so individuals complete the course as their schedule permits, which can create significant periods of delay from when an individual begins a course to the time of completion. Because of the self-paced nature of the training, OPM encounters a significant risk of losing the interest of participants because their work responsibilities take precedence.

&amp;nbsp;

OPM will explore providing participants email reminders to complete the training course and badges as a means to recognize progress to date and to encourage them to complete the entire course.

&amp;nbsp;

OPM has leveraged the its data analytic ambassadors who have the responsibility of serving as a liaison between the goal 3 project team and individuals within their respective divisions to communicate the courses’ availability, as well as the content and benefits to completing the training.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>As the Federal government’s HR leader, OPM designs and executes policies that touch all Federal agencies, their leaders, workers, applicants, retirees and survivors. As part of our mission, OPM collects, manages, and analyzes a range of HR data from a variety of sources. In an effort to optimize policy design and practices, OPM needs a cohesive structure to manage and integrate data across the agency and with external partners. This increased focus on data integration will enrich the data that OPM uses to support policy development and operations and enable OPM to contribute further to rigorous research and evaluations. While integrating data sets holds great potential for improving our knowledge base, we will also be vigilant with respect to the need to protect personally identifiable information in compliance with the law and accepted practice.
