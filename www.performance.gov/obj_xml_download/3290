</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Employee Services</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>OPM identified a promising practice in the use of the Supervisor Situational Judgment Test.&amp;nbsp; According to OPM’s analysis, there is a direct correlation between the administration of the test and improved applicant pools and subsequent successful hiring actions.&amp;nbsp; Since the rollout in January 2014 through September 2015, the agency administered the test in 117 OPM supervisory job announcements resulting in a more qualified pool of candidates from which to make hires. OPM made 69 hires using the test.&amp;nbsp; OPM’s Human Resources Solutions, in conjunction with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, developed a customized Managerial Situational Judgment Test to measure leadership competencies of interest to the Corps.&amp;nbsp; The Corps plans to use the test for future managerial level job openings. OPM also worked with the Defense Logistics Agency to customize the Supervisory Situational Judgment Test for its use. The Defense Logistics Agency started administering their test, in conjunction with an assessment questionnaire, for all supervisory professional and administrative job openings.&amp;nbsp; OPM expects to leverage and promulgate this process to other Federal agencies in FY 2016.

&amp;nbsp;

OPM also hosted an SES resume-based hiring forum, soliciting from the participating agencies lessons learned, best practices, challenges faced, and tools that might facilitate agencies further exploring the resume-based approach to SES hiring.

&amp;nbsp;

Budget reductions are a principal concern.&amp;nbsp; While it is too early to determine, there have been emerging indications that some agencies may be experiencing more challenges related to hiring the best talent in a timely manner.&amp;nbsp; If the employees involved in the hiring process are not experienced or trained, longer hiring times will result. The cascading effect of these hiring-related challenges may not only affect Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey scores, but also have less evident impacts that result from not getting experienced and/or trained talent to fill leadership positions. OPM will continue to look for ways to streamline hiring practices that might result in more efficient and effective hiring practices.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>To foster a heightened connection between employees and their work and their organization, federal agencies and managers must ensure employees find personal meaning in their work, take pride in their work and their organization, and believe they are valued contributors. Engaged employees are passionate and dedicated to their job and organization.  They feel a special bond with their agency and put forth the extra effort needed to improve their own performance and agency results. Employee engagement has been linked to important outcomes, including agency performance, sick leave usage, EEO complaints, and turnover. Engaged employees are less likely to leave their agency, while those who are unengaged will likely start to look for better opportunities elsewhere.
Key drivers of employee engagement are communication, employee involvement, opportunities for development, and recognition. Strong leadership and supervision also are critical to ensuring an engaged workforce as they have a great deal of influence over the factors that drive engagement.
