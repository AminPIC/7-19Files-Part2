</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Retirement Services</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>OPM provides webinar trainings to the HR Community through OPM’s YouTube Channel and the OPM website. The webcasts include Processing Phased Retirement, TSP Transfers and Rollovers: How, When, and Why (or Why Not!); and Overview of Federal Employees Insurance Benefits. OPM delivered six webinars in FY 2015 that received more than 20,000 views.&amp;nbsp; Because the webcasts are hosted online, they continue to provide training to benefits officers on key topics related to retirement. The webinars are available at: https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/benefits-officers-center/training/.

&amp;nbsp;

OPM provided in-person Federal Erroneous Retirement Coverage Corrections Act (FERCCA) trainings to the Department of Energy, Securities and Exchange Commission, General Services Administration, and the Department of the Interior. OPM also provided training on the Act to the Department of Justice. In July, OPM held a Roadshow event with the Securities and Exchange Commission and Federal Executive Board to provide a Civil Service Retirement System and Federal Employees Retirement System overview.

&amp;nbsp;

In FY 2015, budget constraints across the Federal Government resulted in OPM’s cancellation of its annual Agency Benefit Officers’ Training conference. To continue to meet benefits officer mandatory training needs, OPM dedicated time and resources to developing a virtual benefits officers training seminar. Through the Benefits Officers Virtual Training Seminar, held in November 2014, OPM provided updates to participants on benefits initiatives, shared best practices, and discussed crosscutting issues in retirement, insurance, and Thrift Savings Plan administration. The event also featured information on OPM’s Retirement Audit initiative and how to provide a healthy retirement case to OPM. The agency provided an additional virtual Federal benefits seminar in June 2015 that integrated feedback from the November event. The seminar focused on increasing knowledge of the Federal benefits programs and improvements to the retirement process. More than 575 people registered for the June seminar, an increase from the more than 450 registrations for the November seminar.

&amp;nbsp;

While virtual trainings enable OPM to reach a wide audience, the downside is that they do not provide the same level of networking, engagement, and relationship building as in-person trainings. OPM will assess the ability of individuals to travel and attend in-person seminars on an annual basis. If in-person attendance is not feasible, OPM plans to continue providing virtual training seminars.

OPM, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, has determined that performance toward this strategy is making noteworthy progress.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>The Federal government’s commitment to its employees does not end when someone retires from service. OPM administers retirement and insurance benefits for approximately 2.5 million annuitants, survivors, and family members. We must ensure quality delivery of those benefits and respond to retiree questions and concerns in a caring and timely manner. While real progress has been made over the last four years and the strategies outlined below have been implemented in part, they are yet to be finalized and our retirees are yet to realize the full extent of the improvements. Additionally, recognizing that successful benefits processing is a result of not just an efficient processing system or communication with agencies but also a fully engaged employee who is preparing to retire.
