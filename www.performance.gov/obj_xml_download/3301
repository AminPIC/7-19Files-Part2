</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>
	Developing an agency benefit officers’ service delivery model emphasizing shared responsibility for benefits/retirement among employees, OPM and agencies.
	Defining standards for agency benefit officers, measuring their results, and recognizing them for exceptional customer service.
	Develop training certification for agency benefit/retirement officers on retirement services.

</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Retirement Services</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>OPM works with agency benefits officers to ensure accurate and complete retirement claim submissions. To provide better service, OPM solicits feedback from agency benefits officers on their needs. In FY 2015, OPM emailed the Annual Training Survey to more than 1,100 benefits officers. The survey results create the foundation of the upcoming year’s training plan. OPM provided webcast sessions and a virtual training event. As a result of feedback it received, OPM delivered six new webcasts in FY 2015 for the HR community through the OPM YouTube channel and the OPM website, resulting in more than 20,000 views. Webinar views continue to grow as additional benefits officers take the online trainings.

&amp;nbsp;

OPM also delivered two virtual benefits officers training seminars in November and June on benefits initiatives, shared best practices, and crosscutting issues in retirement, insurance, and Thrift Savings Plan administration. The events also featured information on OPM’s Retirement Audit initiative and how to provide a “healthy” retirement case to OPM.

&amp;nbsp;

In FY 2015, budget constraints across the Federal Government resulted in OPM’s cancellation of its annual Agency Benefit Officers’ Training conference. To continue to meet benefits officers’ mandatory training needs, OPM dedicated time and resources to developing virtual benefits officers training seminars.

OPM, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, has highlighted this strategy as a focus area for improvement

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>The Federal government’s commitment to its employees does not end when someone retires from service. OPM administers retirement and insurance benefits for approximately 2.5 million annuitants, survivors, and family members. We must ensure quality delivery of those benefits and respond to retiree questions and concerns in a caring and timely manner. While real progress has been made over the last four years and the strategies outlined below have been implemented in part, they are yet to be finalized and our retirees are yet to realize the full extent of the improvements. Additionally, recognizing that successful benefits processing is a result of not just an efficient processing system or communication with agencies but also a fully engaged employee who is preparing to retire.
