</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Merit System Accountability and Compliance</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>OPM issued 27 agency evaluation reports for FY 2015, 25 of which included required actions.&amp;nbsp; In addition, 29 agency report responses were due by the end of FY 2015, and the agency received all 29.&amp;nbsp; Based on these responses, 83 percent of the Human Capital or HR offices evaluated have demonstrated progress to date by addressing corrective actions.&amp;nbsp; Agencies are expected to address required actions contained in OPM reports within specified timeframes.&amp;nbsp; As of the end of FY 2015, 85 percent of the required actions were addressed within OPM timeframes.

&amp;nbsp;

Also in FY 2015, OPM issued more than 260 Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) certificates to hiring agencies; administered the ALJ examination to several hundred applicants; processed approximately 300 ALJ personnel actions; and processed more than 180 loan requests/extensions.

&amp;nbsp;

Personnel and travel resource limitations continue to constrain OPM’s ability to maintain a robust evaluation program.&amp;nbsp; As of August 2014, the agency had reduced its initial planned number of evaluations for FY 2015 from 124 to 112, and additional reductions may be necessary.&amp;nbsp; Other challenges include the ever-present potential for litigation that attends substantial work on a competitive examining program and associated costs, receiving timely payment of assessment fees from ALJ hiring agencies, and obtaining ALJ surge support to administer the ALJ examination in mass in a timely manner.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>The integrity of the federal workforce is enhanced through the review of the suitability of individual applicants, ongoing reviews of federal employees, and the oversight of agency human resource systems that promote fairness and merit in all hiring and assessment processes. 
As the Suitability Executive Agent, the Director of OPM is responsible for ensuring that those whom agencies select and retain to serve the United States Government and the American people are fit to serve.  To do this, we must develop and implement consistent, uniform policies, tools, and processes for determinations of suitability, assignment to sensitive positions, and access to Federal facilities’ and information systems.  Executing these responsibilities encompasses the collection of background investigation information.  OPM’s activity in support of this goal helps protect our national security and provides the American people a reliable and responsible employee team they can trust in fulfilling important government functions. 
OPM is mandated by statute to ensure delegated human resource authorities are carried out in accordance with merit system principles and OPM standards. In addition, Executive Order 13197 (Government-wide Accountability for Merit System Principles; Workforce Information) authorizes OPM to hold Executive departments and agencies accountable to the President for effective human capital management.
