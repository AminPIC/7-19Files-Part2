</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Merit System Accountability and Compliance</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>OPM rolled out USA Performance to automate the basic Senior Executive Service performance management system. Five agencies started using USA Performance in FY 2015 to better manage the Senior Executive Service performance appraisal cycle. USA Performance deployed seven releases with new enhancements to the system. Enhancements included plan notes, greater flexibility for HR administrators to manage performance plans, and ability to add agency specific performance requirements.&amp;nbsp; OPM experienced delays in USA Performance implementation due to individual agencies’ internal competing priorities, and in a few agencies, rollout was delayed until the second or third quarters.

&amp;nbsp;

OPM has continued to support the implementation of the President’s Management Agenda People and Culture Cross-Agency Priority goal, and has made significant progress in achieving the deliverables established for the goal – particularly with regard to SES reform and modernization, including SES onboarding.&amp;nbsp; For example, agencies are currently piloting an enhanced SES onboarding framework, and OPM is meeting with agency SES onboarding program coordinators and program champions to share pilot details and materials, including the enhanced framework.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>The integrity of the federal workforce is enhanced through the review of the suitability of individual applicants, ongoing reviews of federal employees, and the oversight of agency human resource systems that promote fairness and merit in all hiring and assessment processes. 
As the Suitability Executive Agent, the Director of OPM is responsible for ensuring that those whom agencies select and retain to serve the United States Government and the American people are fit to serve.  To do this, we must develop and implement consistent, uniform policies, tools, and processes for determinations of suitability, assignment to sensitive positions, and access to Federal facilities’ and information systems.  Executing these responsibilities encompasses the collection of background investigation information.  OPM’s activity in support of this goal helps protect our national security and provides the American people a reliable and responsible employee team they can trust in fulfilling important government functions. 
OPM is mandated by statute to ensure delegated human resource authorities are carried out in accordance with merit system principles and OPM standards. In addition, Executive Order 13197 (Government-wide Accountability for Merit System Principles; Workforce Information) authorizes OPM to hold Executive departments and agencies accountable to the President for effective human capital management.
