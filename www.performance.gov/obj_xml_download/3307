&amp;nbsp;

The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 amended the FEHB statute to provide for a self plus one enrollment option in addition to the current self only and self and family enrollment options.&amp;nbsp; During FY 2015, OPM worked with agencies, shared service centers, and Federal retirement programs to amend IT systems to accommodate the new enrollment option.&amp;nbsp; OPM also worked closely with FEHB carriers to amend their IT systems and to submit rate proposals for the 2016 plan year that reflected the expected resource use of the self plus one enrolled population.&amp;nbsp; The 2015 Open Season is the first opportunity for employees and retirees to enroll in self plus one.

&amp;nbsp;

OPM is also increasing IT security efforts and oversight for FEHB plans. OPM issued guidance to carriers on reporting security breaches and will continue to work with agency stakeholders on ensuring contractors follow IT security requirements.

&amp;nbsp;

One of OPM’s challenges is to ensure covered enrollees and family members have access to affordable health care.&amp;nbsp; The inclusion of ineligible family members under self and family enrollments can adversely impact premium cost.&amp;nbsp; The extent of ineligible family members covered under FEHB self and family enrollments are currently unknown. To address this gap, OPM procured the services of a contractor to perform an audit on a representative sample of family members on enrollees FEHB coverage to determine ineligible family members.&amp;nbsp; The vendor is currently conducting an assessment, and OPM expects to review the results of the assessment in FY 2016.
</Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update></Strategic_Objective><Strategic_Goals><Strategic_Goal><id>3298</id><strategic_goal_header>SG9 Healthier Americans</strategic_goal_header><strategic_goal_statement>Increase the percentage of states covered by at least one Multi-State insurance carrier and percentage of states covered by two or more Multi-State insurance issuers. Increase the number of carriers receiving OPM “Exemplary” or “Most Improved” distinction for health care quality or customer service.
Improve overall satisfaction with health plan as reported by health plan enrollees in Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS). Decrease the number of ineligible dependents on enrollee’s FEHB coverage.
</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>This goal establishes OPM’s role in improving the health status of populations covered under OPM- sponsored health insurance programs.  Incorporating responsibilities granted through the Affordable Care Act, populations served by OPM-sponsored health insurance programs include employees of tribal organizations and formerly uninsured Americans served by Multi-State Plans as well as Federal employees, Federal retirees, and dependents of Federal employees and retirees.
High quality health insurance promotes access to care, supports better health and better care, empowers enrollee choice, and increases employee loyalty.  Better care prevents long term disability and disease, stabilizes chronic conditions, and minimizes hospitalization.  Effective worksite wellness programs along with health conscious workers and community environments complement insurance benefits and reinforce positive choices.   Additional benefits, such as life, long term care, dental, vision, and flexible spending accounts, improve employee quality of life, meet unique family needs, and increase employee loyalty.

This assessment incorporates a discrete set of quantifiable measures to examine key aspects of health plan performance and a contract oversight evaluation by the contract officer. The FEHB Plan Performance Assessment will be linked to health plan profit. Quantifiable measures are grouped into three performance areas: Clinical Quality, Customer Services, and Resource Use (collectively termed QCR). The QCR measures consist of Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) and Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) measures. The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) oversees the set of HEDIS and CAHPS measures which is used nationwide to measure performance of health plans in various areas. OPM is using NCQA’s national or regional benchmarks in the FEHB Plan Performance Assessment.  
To focus attention on priority issues, OPM has developed a hierarchy for the QCR measures. In assigning priority levels to measures, OPM considered whether the measure assessed health outcomes, supported specific OPM policy priorities, and was relevant to FEHB subpopulations with particular health needs. Improvement on these high priority measures will indicate improved quality and carrier focus on critical healthcare areas for the FEHB Program.
 
This assessment system directly supports Goal 9 of the 2014-2018 OPM Strategic Plan by requiring that FEHB health plans meet rigorous industry standards and higher levels of health plan accountability. These higher standards and increased accountability lead to higher quality health benefits available to federal employees, federal retirees, their families, and newly eligible populations. This new initiative is also closely aligned with the current Administration’s goal of health care system improvement and parallels other federal agency and private payer processes.
