</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Healthcare and Insurance</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>OPM performed outreach to Department of Defense (DOD) civilians, presenting “Improving Total Force Influenza Immunization” to the DOD Influenza Policy Synchronization Group and again as a webinar to health promotion specialists, wellness programmers, and healthcare professionals within the Department.&amp;nbsp; The Department has approximately 425,000 FEHB beneficiaries, representing 65 percent of the total Department Federal civilian population.

&amp;nbsp;

OPM was a featured speaker at the Healthier Federal Workers’ Symposium.&amp;nbsp; The agency highlighted its efforts to control hypertension, and reduce heart attack and stroke rates.

&amp;nbsp;

Too few FEHB members are completing health risk assessments and biometric screening through their health plans, limiting OPM’s ability to direct members to coaching or other lifestyle modification programs that can control obesity, plus prevent diabetes and other chronic illnesses.&amp;nbsp; OPM has given FEHB carriers a goal of completing health risk assessments and performing biometric screening on all adults once every three years and will assess their performance.
</Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update></Strategic_Objective><Strategic_Goals><Strategic_Goal><id>3298</id><strategic_goal_header>SG9 Healthier Americans</strategic_goal_header><strategic_goal_statement>Increase the percentage of states covered by at least one Multi-State insurance carrier and percentage of states covered by two or more Multi-State insurance issuers. Increase the number of carriers receiving OPM “Exemplary” or “Most Improved” distinction for health care quality or customer service.
Improve overall satisfaction with health plan as reported by health plan enrollees in Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS). Decrease the number of ineligible dependents on enrollee’s FEHB coverage.
</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>This goal establishes OPM’s role in improving the health status of populations covered under OPM- sponsored health insurance programs.  Incorporating responsibilities granted through the Affordable Care Act, populations served by OPM-sponsored health insurance programs include employees of tribal organizations and formerly uninsured Americans served by Multi-State Plans as well as Federal employees, Federal retirees, and dependents of Federal employees and retirees.
High quality health insurance promotes access to care, supports better health and better care, empowers enrollee choice, and increases employee loyalty.  Better care prevents long term disability and disease, stabilizes chronic conditions, and minimizes hospitalization.  Effective worksite wellness programs along with health conscious workers and community environments complement insurance benefits and reinforce positive choices.   Additional benefits, such as life, long term care, dental, vision, and flexible spending accounts, improve employee quality of life, meet unique family needs, and increase employee loyalty.
