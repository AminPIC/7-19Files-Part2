</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>Sustaining the quality and supply of our water resources is essential to safeguarding human health.&amp;nbsp; More than 300 million people living in the United States rely on the safety of tap water provided by public water systems that are subject to national drinking water standards.&amp;nbsp; Over the next 4 years, EPA will help protect human health and make America’s water systems sustainable and secure by:

&amp;nbsp;


	Providing financial assistance for&amp;nbsp; public water system infrastructure to protect and maintain drinking water quality;
	Strengthening compliance with drinking water standards;
	Continuing to protect sources of drinking water from contamination and ensuring reliable supplies of drinking water as water temperatures increase (including addressing the harmful effects of algal blooms);
	Developing new and revising existing drinking water standards to address known and emerging contaminants that endanger human health; and,
	Supporting states, tribes, and territories in their oversight of public water systems in implementing these standards, and supporting water systems directly through provision of guidance, training, and information.


&amp;nbsp;

While promoting sustainable management of drinking water infrastructure, we will provide needed oversight and technical assistance to states, tribes, and territories, so that their water systems comply with or exceed existing standards and are able to comply with new standards.&amp;nbsp; We will also promote the construction of infrastructure that brings safe drinking water into the homes of small, rural, and disadvantaged communities and increase efforts to guard the nation's critical drinking water infrastructure.

&amp;nbsp;

In addition, EPA is actively working Agency-wide and with external partners and stakeholders to implement a multi-faceted drinking water strategy.&amp;nbsp; With this approach, EPA seeks to: &amp;nbsp;address chemicals and contaminants by group, as opposed to working on a chemical-by-chemical basis; foster the development of new drinking water treatment technologies; use the authority of multiple statutes in addressing drinking water contamination; and, encourage collaboration with states and tribes to share more complete data from monitoring at public water systems.&amp;nbsp; To this end, the Agency is replacing the federal and state components of EPA’s Safe Drinking Water Information System (SDWIS) with a new system.&amp;nbsp; SDWIS Prime is designed to assist regulatory agencies with their implementation of the public water system supervision (PWSS) program, as well as improve the efficiency of sharing drinking water data among states, tribes, and the Agency. &amp;nbsp;This will allow for better targeting of federal and state funding and technical assistance resources, and improve data quality while increasing public access to drinking water data.

&amp;nbsp;

Science-based water quality criteria are essential to protect our public water systems, groundwater and surface water bodies, and recreational waters.&amp;nbsp; These criteria are the foundation for state and tribal tools to safeguard human health such as public advisories for beaches, fish consumption, and drinking water. &amp;nbsp;Over the next 4 years, we will expand that science to improve our understanding of emerging potential waterborne threats to human health, develop new criteria, and validate testing methods that provide quicker results and enable faster action on beach safety.

&amp;nbsp;

External Factors and Emerging Issues

EPA’s underground injection control (UIC) program provides a framework to ensure protection of underground sources of drinking water from endangerment related to the construction, operation, permitting, and closure of injection wells that place fluids underground for storage, disposal, enhanced recovery of oil and gas, or minerals recovery. &amp;nbsp;Natural gas plays a key role in our clean energy future. &amp;nbsp;Hydraulic fracturing is a key way to recover natural gas from sources. &amp;nbsp;EPA will ensure proper oversight of hydraulic fracturing operations in cases where diesel fuel is used by implementing permitting guidance under SDWA's Class II UIC program for hydraulic fracturing. &amp;nbsp;EPA is working with state and tribal organizations, along with other federal agencies, to develop and implement voluntary strategies for encouraging the use of alternatives to diesel in hydraulic fracturing and improving compliance with other Class II regulations, including possible risks from induced seismic events and the risk from radionuclides in disposal wells. &amp;nbsp;EPA is also continuing to work with state, tribal, and industry representatives to make UIC Class II regulations and information more transparent and to implement best practices and promote coordination between UIC and oil and gas agencies.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Office of Water</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>EPA has made progress addressing the safety of our nation’s drinking water, with over 93 percent of the nation’s population served by community water systems (CWSs) receiving drinking water that meets all applicable health-based drinking water standards in FY 2014. The following four examples highlight how EPA is making progress toward its drinking water objective in collaboration with states, tribes and local utilities:

&amp;nbsp;


	Through the DWSRF, EPA helps ensure reliable delivery of safe water to people served by small water systems by funding infrastructure improvements, with 70 percent of assistance agreements going to drinking water systems serving fewer than 10,000 people. This funding supports EPA’s cross-agency strategy of making a visible difference in communities, especially in rural and disadvantaged areas.
	EPA is achieving its priority goal of working closely with states through capacity development and optimization programs to enhance small system sustainability, principally through optimization trainings and state-EPA workgroups and products. These activities improve the states’ capability to help small systems, including drinking water systems on tribal lands, address their technical, managerial, and financial needs.
	If adopted by states, EPA’s 2012 recreational water quality criteria recommendations[1] will protect the public from exposure to harmful levels of fecal pathogens.
	More than 2,000 public water systems participating in the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule[2] survey provided drinking water monitoring data for 30 unregulated contaminants; these data support decisions on whether to establish health-based standards to protect drinking water.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>The nation’s water resources are the lifeblood of our communities, supporting our economy and way of life.  Across most of the country, we enjoy and depend upon reliable sources of clean and safe water.  Just a few decades ago, many of our drinking water systems provided very limited treatement to water coming through the tap.  Drinking water was often the cause of illnesses linked to microbiological and other contaminants.  Many of our surface waters would not have met today’s water quality standards.  Some of the nation’s rivers were open sewers, posing health risks, and many water bodies were so polluted that safe swimming, fishing, and recreation were not possible.
 
We have made significant progress since enactment of the landmark Clean Water Act (CWA), Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), and Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act approximately 40 years ago.  Today, although the enhanced quality of our surface waters and the greater safety of our drinking water are testaments to decades of environmental protection and investment, serious challenges remain.  Many small drinking water systems are particularly challenged by the need to improve and maintain infrastructure and develop the capacity to comply with new and existing standards.  Tens of thousands of homes, primarily in tribal and disadvantaged communities and the territories, still lack access to basic sanitation and drinking water.  The rate at which new waters are listed for water quality impairments exceeds the pace at which restored waters are removed from the list.
 
For many years, nonpoint source pollution, principally nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediments, has been recognized as the largest remaining impediment to improving water quality.  Recent national surveys have found that our waters are stressed by nutrient pollution, excess sedimentation, and degradation of shoreline vegetation, which affect upwards of 50 percent of our lakes and streams.[1]  Pollution discharged from industrial, municipal, agricultural, and stormwater sources continue to be causes of water quality problems, as does the degradation of watersheds and their natural plant communities and hydrologic structure, which help protect water quality.  A changing climate will compound these problems, highlighting the need to work with our partners to evaluate options for protecting infrastructure, conserving water, reducing energy use, adopting green infrastructure and locally-driven watershed-based practices, and improving the resilience of infrastructural and natural systems, including utilities, watersheds, and estuaries.[2]
 
Over the next 4 years, EPA will reinvigorate efforts to improve water quality, working with states, territories, and tribes to better safeguard human health and make America’s water systems sustainable and secure.  We will:
 
Assess the status of and changes in water quality through the National Aquatic Resource Surveys;
Strengthen the protection of our aquatic ecosystems;
Improve watershed-based approaches to reduce pollution;
Implement innovative technologies;
Carry out comprehensive approaches to help maintain healthy watersheds;
Foster increased protection of drinking water sources through improved coordination; between CWA and SDWA programs at the national, regional, state, and watershed scales;
Focus efforts in key geographic areas[3]; and,
Take measures to incorporate climate change considerations into clean water and drinking water program planning and implementation.
 
EPA is establishing two Agency Priority Goals for FY 2014-2015 that are continuations from FY 2012-2013:  (1) to improve public health protection for persons served by small drinking water systems by strengthening the technical, managerial, and financial capacity of those systems[4]; and, (2) to improve, restore, or maintain water quality by enhancing nonpoint source program accountability, incentives, and effectiveness.[5]  In the first Priority Goal, EPA will continue to partner with the states and pilot with several tribes to enhance their capacity development, operator certification, and treatment optimization programs.  These efforts are intended to build upon or reinvigorate efforts already underway across the country.  The Agency is continuing to partner with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) Rural Utilities Service to promote drinking water and wastewater system sustainability, foster water sector workforce opportunities in rural America, and coordinate infrastructure funding as appropriate.  EPA will continue to provide states and tribes with funding to assist utilities with financing drinking water infrastructure needs.  In the second Priority Goal, EPA is implementing a strengthened nonpoint source (CWA Section 319) grant program[6] to continue yielding on-the-ground water quality results in watersheds nationwide.  A significant component of this effort is working with state partners to update their nonpoint source programs, which guide overall priorities and investments for Section 319 funds.  Updated nonpoint source programs, combined with collaboration efforts with USDA, state departments of agriculture, and other partners, will result in better protection of water quality from nonpoint sources of pollution.
 
Working with our partners, the Agency’s effort to protect our waters has two objectives—protecting human health and protecting and restoring watersheds and aquatic ecosystems.

Resilience is the ability of a system to absorb change and disturbance and retain its fundamental function and/or structure.
For more information on these programs and their performance measures, see the annual National Water Program Guidance, available at http://www.epa.gov/water/waterplan/index.html.
FY 2014-2015 Agency Priority Goal:  Improve public health protection for persons served by small drinking water systems, which account for more than 97 percent of public water systems in the U.S., by strengthening the technical, managerial, and financial capacity of those systems.  By September 30, 2015, EPA will engage with an additional ten states (for a total of 30 states) and three tribes to improve small drinking water system capability to provide safe drinking water, an invaluable resource.
FY 2014-2015 Agency Priority Goal:  Improve, restore, and maintain water quality by enhancing nonpoint source program leveraging, accountability, and on-the-ground effectiveness to address the nation’s largest sources of pollution.  By September 30, 2015, 100 percent of the states will have updated nonpoint source management programs that comport with the new Section 319 grant guidelines that will result in better targeting of resources through prioritization and increased coordination with USDA.

Improvements in the drinking water sector preparedness to prevent and mitigate the duration and severity of interruptions to the delivery of safe drinking water continues to be necessary in light of evolving stresses, whether attributed to natural, accidental, or intentional circumstances or aging or stressed infrastructure.  Extreme weather events, sea level rise, shifting precipitation patterns and temperature variability, all intensified by climate change, have significant implications for the sustainability of the water sector. By planning for, assessing and adapting to these challenges, the water sector can fulfill their public health and environmental missions and begin the process of becoming climate ready.
 
Under Presidential Policy Directive 21, the President has designated EPA as the Sector Specific Agency responsible for enhancing the resilience and preparedness of the nation’s water sector, which includes about 180,000 drinking water and wastewater utilities. Further, the Department of Homeland Security has designated the water sector to be one of four “lifeline” sectors, meaning that if a disruption of service occurs in any one of these four sectors, then a community or region will experience potentially significant consequences in terms of public health, the economy, and the other critical infrastructure sectors, many of which rely on the lifeline sectors.
 
EPA’s green infrastructure program works with communities to assess how green infrastructure can enhance their stormwater management systems and be an integral part of their climate resiliency strategy. The agency has developed green infrastructure tools and resources for communities to use in planning their long-term stormwater actions.
 
EPA’s efforts to improve the resilience of the water sector derive not only from these homeland security directives, but also from its core mission as an agency, viz., the protection of public health and the environment.
 
Drinking water and wastewater utilities must remain operational in the face of all hazards if we are to preserve the many gains in public health and environmental protection which have been realized from the water sector. As with the other lifeline sectors, the water sector is at risk from a multitude of threats spanning natural disasters, climate change, cyber-attacks, and terrorism.
 
The 2002 amendments to the SDWA required drinking water systems serving more than 3,300 people to submit a vulnerability assessment to EPA. However, Congress required that such systems prepare a vulnerability assessment as a one-time mandate, not a recurring one. The statutory requirements also excluded water systems serving fewer than 3,300 people and all wastewater systems.
 
EPA’s water security and resilience program has developed a robust array of successful tools, training, and direct technical assistance for the water sector to improve prevention, as well as enable appropriate situational response, including application of resources, to mitigate the interruption of delivery of safe drinking water to the nation’s consumers. For instance, under EPA’s leadership, the number of intrastate mutual aid compacts (peer-to-peer assistance networks) has increased from just three states in 2006 to 49 states in 2015. Small and larger scale incidents have triggered the activation of eighty-six percent of these agreements. Despite this success, enhancing resilience competes with many other priorities within the water sector, notably, regulatory compliance, aging infrastructure, and funding inadequacies. As such, EPA continues to try to lower the barriers to adopting resilience measures by providing innovative, easy to use software tools and in person, nationwide training sessions to help water systems of all sizes and types to enhance their resilience.
 
In addition to motivating the water sector, EPA must be mindful of the evolving threats to the water sector. Extreme weather events, the increasing impacts of climate change, and the almost omnipresent threat of cyber-attacks in particular will impose a daunting challenge to the water sector, as evident by several recent events: the persistent drought in California and much of the west, drought then extreme flooding in Texas, storm surge in New York and New Jersey from Hurricane Sandy, and cyber intrusions into water utilities’ operations. Such threats will jeopardize the ability of the water sector to continue to fulfill its public health and environmental missions unless the sector manages to improve its resilience to all hazards.
 
In response, EPA has undertaken a national effort to enhance resilience—with an emphasis on severe drought, flooding, cybersecurity, and climate change—through the provision of planning tools, training sessions, and direct technical assistance.
 
Stormwater is an increasing water infrastructure challenge. As more land is developed with impervious surfaces, the amount of stormwater that communities must manage continues to grow. Stormwater is a significant source of water pollution, contributes to sewer overflows, and causes local flooding. As the climate changes, more precipitation and more intense rain events in certain portions of the country will further strain community stormwater management systems. In the west and southwest increasing drought conditions will emphasize the need for communities to use rain as a beneficial water resource before in can become polluted stormwater runoff.
