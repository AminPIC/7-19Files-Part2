</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>Taking into account the most current health effects research findings[1], EPA has completed new, more health-protective national ambient air quality standards for particulate matter (December 2012), lead (October 2008), sulfur dioxide (June 2010), nitrogen dioxide (January 2010), and carbon monoxide (August 2011), and is currently reviewing the standard for ozone.&amp;nbsp; Over the next 4 years, we will work with states and tribes to develop and implement plans to achieve and maintain these standards.&amp;nbsp; Our efforts provide the tools and information necessary for EPA, states, and tribes to implement air quality standards and controls.

&amp;nbsp;

EPA will work with states and tribes to decrease the emissions that contribute to interstate transport of air pollution.&amp;nbsp; These efforts will help many areas of the country attain the standards and achieve significant improvements in human health.&amp;nbsp; Working with states and tribes, EPA will continue implementing cost-effective multi-state regional programs designed to control the significant contributions of power plant and other stationary source emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) to air quality problems (i.e., nonattainment and interference with maintenance of ozone and PM2.5 NAAQS) in downwind areas.&amp;nbsp; Operating programs in 2014 will include the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) or a replacement program for control of transported ozone and PM2.5 pollution[2], in addition to the national acid rain SO2 and NOx emission reduction programs.

&amp;nbsp;

As we implement national air quality standards, we will seek ways to increase efficiency and maximize results.&amp;nbsp; These efforts include: &amp;nbsp;working with states to improve the state implementation plan approval process, including the use of full-cycle analysis (i.e., identifying specific actions along a time line needed to facilitate the timely issuance of implementation rules and guidelines); modernizing our training program for state, local, and tribal agencies through an e-learning system; and implementation of electronic emission reporting as part of the Agency’s E-Enterprise initiative.

Additionally, EPA will work to ensure that our efforts to improve air quality consider low-income and minority communities that are disproportionately impacted by pollution. &amp;nbsp;The Agency will continue to implement the goals of the Environmental Justice (EJ) 2014 strategy that focus on protecting health in communities overburdened by pollution, empowering communities to take action to improve their health and environment, and establishing partnerships with local, state, tribal, and federal organizations to achieve healthy and sustainable communities.

&amp;nbsp;

EPA has finalized a number of air pollution control standards over the last decade that have substantially reduced, and will continue to reduce, PM, NOx, volatile organic chemicals (VOCs), air toxics, and GHG emissions.&amp;nbsp; These standards will cut emissions from new vehicles and engines by over 90 percent, with an estimated $290 billion in net health benefits by 2030.&amp;nbsp; In addition, EPA partnership programs such as the SmartWay Transport program, are achieving important reductions in emissions from the existing fleet of diesel engines that are not subject to the new standards.[3]

&amp;nbsp;

Looking forward, EPA will collect and evaluate mobile source emission data to help guide future program priorities.&amp;nbsp; Other factors to consider include the health and environmental effects of emissions and future advancements in technology that could provide opportunities for further emission reductions.

The Agency also recognizes the importance of fuels work and the critical need to understand the challenges and opportunities this work presents.&amp;nbsp; EPA will continue to coordinate with the Department of Energy (DOE), Department of Agriculture (USDA), and other interagency partners on these issues as appropriate.&amp;nbsp; The Agency plans to focus on streamlining the implementation processes of the renewable fuel standard (RFS) program, including the annual standard-setting process and new fuel pathway approvals.&amp;nbsp; EPA will also strengthen its oversight of industry compliance with RFS standards and core fuels and fuels additive registration mandates through a voluntary third-party quality assurance program to verify that renewable identification numbers (RINs) have been validly generated.&amp;nbsp; In addition, proposed modifications to the exporter provisions of the RFS program will help to ensure that an appropriate number and type of RINs are retired whenever renewable fuel is exported.

&amp;nbsp;

Air toxics and other air pollutants can be widespread and/or community specific. &amp;nbsp;They are emitted by large industry, small businesses, motor vehicles, and many other common activities. Although certain chemicals are ubiquitous throughout the country, in some areas of concentrated industrial and/or mobile source activity, concentrations may be significantly greater.&amp;nbsp; To support effective air toxics reduction policies, EPA uses data from our national toxics monitoring network and from national and local assessments to provide key information to better characterize risks and assess priorities.&amp;nbsp; EPA also leverages pollution prevention and green expertise to reduce air toxics emissions and associated risk.

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;EPA recognizes that air toxics pose unique challenges both nationally and at the community level, and we focus on relatively high-risk sources, pollutants, and exposure situations.&amp;nbsp; EPA will continue to set and enforce control technology-based air toxics emissions standards and, where needed, amend those standards to address residual risk and technology advancements.&amp;nbsp; These regulations are aimed at reducing toxic air pollution from stationary sources and targeted priority source categories, reducing pollution in communities, utilizing a more cost-effective “sector-based” approach, and providing tools to help communities and other stakeholders participate in rulemaking.&amp;nbsp; Priority categories include petroleum refining, iron and steel manufacturing, chemical manufacturing, and Portland cement.&amp;nbsp; EPA takes advantage of the natural overlap of certain air toxics and criteria pollutant rules and coordinates the development and implementation of Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards and New Source Performance Standards (NSPSs) where appropriate.&amp;nbsp; By coordinating MACT standard development for specific source categories with other rulemaking efforts, EPA can substantially reduce the resources needed to develop standards; provide more certainty and lower cost for industry; simplify implementation for state, local, and tribal agencies; and, enhance cost-effective regulatory approaches.&amp;nbsp; To address unacceptable risks that may remain after implementing national strategies, EPA works with states, tribes, and local agencies and organizations to understand the risks at the local level, target the problem areas, and tailor reduction strategies and approaches to the unique situations in those areas.

To improve indoor air quality, EPA deploys programs that educate the public about indoor air quality concerns, including radon, and promotes public action to reduce potential risks in homes, schools, and workplaces.&amp;nbsp; Included among the people most exposed to indoor air pollutants are&amp;nbsp; those most susceptible to the effects—the young, the elderly, and the chronically ill.&amp;nbsp; In addition, EPA collaborates with state and tribal organizations, environmental and public health officials, housing, energy, and building organizations, school personnel who manage school environments, and health care providers who treat children prone to or suffering disproportionately from asthma.&amp;nbsp; The focus of these efforts is to create, expand, and leverage systems already in place to support community efforts to address indoor air quality health risks.

&amp;nbsp;

External Factors and Emerging Issues

External factors that will affect air quality program implementation include the outcome of the appeal of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) decision and continuing legal challenges to stationary source rules.[4] &amp;nbsp;Also, impacts from a changing climate may worsen existing indoor environmental problems and introduce new ones as temperatures change and the frequency and/or severity of adverse outdoor events increase.&amp;nbsp; These impacts include increased mold from water damage and more time spent indoors where air may be of poorer quality.

</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Office of Air and Radiation</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>EPA is on track to meet its strategic targets supporting this objective. By way of context, between 1980 and 2013, gross domestic product increased 145 percent, vehicle miles traveled increased 95 percent, energy consumption increased 25 percent, and the U.S. population grew by 39 percent. During the same period, total emissions of the six principal air pollutants dropped by 62 percent. Environmental indicators related to air toxics show improving outdoor air quality trends,[1] and continued progress in preventing lung cancer deaths from radon exposure and reducing adverse asthma health outcomes. Despite significant progress in improving air quality, in 2013 approximately 75.4 million people nationwide lived in counties with pollution levels above the primary National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) and emissions of air pollutants continued to impact air quality and human health.

&amp;nbsp;

In recent years, EPA has acted to dramatically improve America’s air quality by designing and developing national programs that, when fully implemented, will achieve significant gains in human health. These actions include finalizing standards that will improve air quality and save money at the gas pump, implementing health-based ambient air quality standards grounded in the best available scientific research, proposing regulations to ensure that all new wood heaters will emit significantly less particulate matter into communities, and proposing for the first time that refineries monitor emission in such a way that neighboring communities are not being exposed to unintended emissions. EPA also helped reduce risks of indoor air pollution by characterizing the risks to human health, developing techniques for reducing those risks, and educating the public and key sectors about actions they can take to reduce risks from indoor air.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Climate change poses risks to human health, the environment, cultural resources, the economy, and quality of life.[1]  These changes are expected to create further challenges to protecting human health and welfare.  Many effects of a changing climate are already evident and will persist into the future regardless of future levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  For example, average U.S. temperatures are rising, snow and rainfall patterns are shifting, and more extreme climate events—like heavy rainstorms and record high temperatures—are already affecting society, human health, and the environment.  Potential climate change impacts may also make it more difficult to achieve clean air goals.  To better protect human health and the environment, EPA must recognize and consider the challenge a changing climate poses to the environment. 
 
Notwithstanding this challenge, since passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments in 1990, nationwide air quality has improved significantly.[2]  Levels of those pollutants linked to the greatest health impacts continue to decline.  From 2003 to 2011, population-weighted ambient concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone have decreased 26 percent and 16 percent, respectively.  Even with this progress, in 2010 approximately 40 percent of the U.S. population lived in counties with air that did not meet health-based standards for at least one pollutant.  Long-term exposure to elevated levels of certain air pollutants has been associated with increased risk of cancer, premature mortality, and damage to the immune, neurological, reproductive, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems.[3]  Because people spend much of their lives indoors, the quality of indoor air is also a major health concern.  Indoor allergens and irritants play a significant role in making asthma worse and triggering asthma attacks.  The most recent data (2011) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tell us that 26 million Americans have asthma, and in 2010, CDC reports that asthma was the primary diagnosis for nearly 2 million hospital emergency visits.[4]  In 2008, more than half of children and one-third of adults who had an asthma attack missed school or work because of asthma and total costs for Americans from asthma was $56 billion in 2007.[5]   Exposure to indoor radon is responsible for an estimated 21,000 premature lung cancer deaths each year.[6]  Twenty percent of the population spends the day indoors in elementary and secondary schools, where potential problems with leaky roofs and with heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems can trigger a host of health problems, including asthma and allergies.
