</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>Recognizing the potential hazards of radiation, Congress charged EPA with the primary responsibility for protecting people and the environment from harmful and avoidable exposures.&amp;nbsp; In fulfilling this responsibility, the Agency will review and update its radiation protection regulations and guidance and operate RadNet, the Agency’s national environmental radiation monitoring system.&amp;nbsp; EPA will also maintain personnel expertise, capabilities, and equipment readiness of the radiological emergency response program, including the Agency’s Radiological Emergency Response Team.&amp;nbsp; In addition, EPA will provide regulatory oversight of DOE’s Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), inspect WIPP waste generator facilities, and evaluate DOE’s compliance with EPA’s radioactive waste disposal standards and applicable environmental laws and regulations.

External Factors and Emerging Issues

There are several emerging issues and external factors that will have an impact on how we carry out our radiation program, including new designs and technologies for nuclear power plant facilities as well as new uranium extraction and processing technologies.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Office of Air and Radiation</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>EPA is on track to meet its strategic objective of minimizing exposure to radiation by maintaining readiness, both in personnel and assets, to support federal radiological emergency response and recovery operations. EPA’s regulatory and non-regulatory activities support its mission to protect human health and the environment by minimizing unnecessary exposures to radiation, including operating and maintaining RadNet, providing oversight at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), and developing important rules and guidance.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Climate change poses risks to human health, the environment, cultural resources, the economy, and quality of life.[1]  These changes are expected to create further challenges to protecting human health and welfare.  Many effects of a changing climate are already evident and will persist into the future regardless of future levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  For example, average U.S. temperatures are rising, snow and rainfall patterns are shifting, and more extreme climate events—like heavy rainstorms and record high temperatures—are already affecting society, human health, and the environment.  Potential climate change impacts may also make it more difficult to achieve clean air goals.  To better protect human health and the environment, EPA must recognize and consider the challenge a changing climate poses to the environment. 
 
Notwithstanding this challenge, since passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments in 1990, nationwide air quality has improved significantly.[2]  Levels of those pollutants linked to the greatest health impacts continue to decline.  From 2003 to 2011, population-weighted ambient concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone have decreased 26 percent and 16 percent, respectively.  Even with this progress, in 2010 approximately 40 percent of the U.S. population lived in counties with air that did not meet health-based standards for at least one pollutant.  Long-term exposure to elevated levels of certain air pollutants has been associated with increased risk of cancer, premature mortality, and damage to the immune, neurological, reproductive, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems.[3]  Because people spend much of their lives indoors, the quality of indoor air is also a major health concern.  Indoor allergens and irritants play a significant role in making asthma worse and triggering asthma attacks.  The most recent data (2011) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tell us that 26 million Americans have asthma, and in 2010, CDC reports that asthma was the primary diagnosis for nearly 2 million hospital emergency visits.[4]  In 2008, more than half of children and one-third of adults who had an asthma attack missed school or work because of asthma and total costs for Americans from asthma was $56 billion in 2007.[5]   Exposure to indoor radon is responsible for an estimated 21,000 premature lung cancer deaths each year.[6]  Twenty percent of the population spends the day indoors in elementary and secondary schools, where potential problems with leaky roofs and with heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems can trigger a host of health problems, including asthma and allergies.
