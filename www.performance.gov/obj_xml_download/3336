</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>Information technology (IT) is critical to NASA’s infrastructure and mission success. To support NASA’s missions effectively, we must inspire excellence in IT planning and service delivery across organizational and functional boundaries. We must find ways to use information technology that supports a more collaborative, geographically diverse and mobile working culture, keeps our IT skills and capabilities up-to-date to serve NASA’s missions, and protects those missions from ever-evolving IT security threats.

Our approach to IT planning and service delivery emphasizes responsive innovation, transparency, and accountability. In planning, we take an agency-wide view that considers NASA’s diverse mission needs to guide IT policy, investment decisions, and management practices. At the same time, our approach calls for rigorous assessments of investment trade-offs and sequencing to balance the cost, quality, and timing of our IT capabilities to optimize value while limiting mission risk. We will collaborate with NASA leaders to prioritize and sequence our information management investments to deliver the right blend of capabilities over time to effectively and affordably support NASA.

</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Office of the Chief Information Officer</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>NASA, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, has highlighted this strategic objective as a focus area for improvement.

Through the Strategic Review and the Agency’s other performance management processes, NASA reviews recent accomplishments and near term plans for the Agency’s strategic objectives and programs. The Agency Information Technology (IT) Services Program falls under Strategic Objective 3.3, managed by the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO). During the 2015 Strategic Review, NASA found that OCIO is on track for several performance measures, including the Security Operations Center (SOC) upgrades and cross-agency priority (CAP) goals, such as the Smarter IT Delivery CAP goal. Specific performance measures for the next two years can be found in NASA’s FY 2016 and FY 2017 Annual Performance Plans.

The Strategic Review also addresses long-term strategic outcomes, alignment, and key management challenges for each strategic objective, as well as across NASA’s portfolio of activities. During last year’s Strategic Review, Strategic Objective 3.3 was rated as achieving Satisfactory Performance. For 2015, the OCIO assessed NASA’s performance toward achieving Strategic Objective 3.3 for IT from a broader perspective (as opposed to only assessing the Agency IT Services Program). As a result, the assessment shows that NASA has the opportunity for significant strategic improvement. No single entity controls and oversees NASA’s overall IT requirements, budget, resources, and results. Analyses show that areas (stovepipes) within the current IT management and operating models are unsustainable. OCIO identified a range of opportunities and strategic risks/challenges. OCIO plans to take the following near term actions:


	Implement a functionally aligned program for enterprise IT infrastructure services that focuses on sustainable, efficient, integrated, and secure IT to enable NASA’s mission.
	
		Based on internal management decisions and on new requirements from Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA), changes to NASA’s IT policy, governance, strategy, and/or management and operating models may be required.
	
	
	Implement an integrated risk management approach that addresses management of investment risk, IT program/project risk, and cybersecurity risk.
	Implement a portfolio management capability to optimize enablement of NASA’s mission goals and objectives through the strategic application of IT.


&amp;nbsp;

These performance improvement actions will result in a transformation of the NASA IT management and operating models.

Additional details on the FY 2015 performance for supporting Performance Goals and Annual Performance Indicators are provided in NASA’s FY 2015 Annual Performance Report. Information on the strategies for achieving this strategic objective can be found in the 2014 NASA Strategic Plan.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>NASA is proud to be the U.S. agency charged with exploring the unknown in space and driving new advances in aerospace science and technology on behalf of the American public. Reaching for the stars requires dedicated, knowledgeable people and cutting-edge facilities and capabilities to provide the tools and support necessary to carry out our ambitious tasks. We strive to accomplish our mission with the utmost care-recognizing that we are stewards of taxpayer dollars, critical human capital, and one-of-a-kind facilities. We maintain a large and diverse set of technical capabilities and assets to support NASA missions and the work of other Federal agencies and the private sector to test validate, and optimize innovations.
We understand that a skilled, valued, and diverse workforce is central to creating and maintaining the capabilities to explore the solar system and beyond and for understanding our home planet. NASA will continue to maintain and ensure the availability and safety of critical capabilities and facilities necessary for advancing our space-, air-, and Earth-based activities. We will provide the vision and leadership to advance critical spaceflight capabilities and ensure American launch vehicles can support our exploration activities. Our activities support a skilled, innovative, and diverse workforce and the safety of that workforce. Further, we strive for management excellence and sustainable practices that assure the wisest uses of our resources.
Our goal is to support all of NASA’s space-, air-, and Earth-based research and innovation activities producing the best return on the Nation’s investment. We will diligently work to ensure that NASA has the resources necessary to further exploration and aeronautics, understand Earth, transfer knowledge, and share NASA’s story. We will continue to engage and involve the public and other stakeholders in our activities and work to build an open, transparent, and participatory organization.
As part of this pursuit, we must ensure that our facilities, resources, and plans are sustainable. This means exploring new ways of doing business. We will advance our efficiency and sustainability through wise investments and innovative approaches to resource management, including divesting ourselves of infrastructure no longer needed, so that we can achieve our core mission within our budget.
The missions we pursue under this goal helps to address national challenges and allow us to take advantage of unique opportunities to bring benefits to the Nation. For example:
• We are investing wisely
We are prioritizing investments and finding innovative ways to operate and sustain our capabilities.
• We are sustaining and exercising critical national capabilities
We are ensuring that cutting-edge capabilities and facilities are maintained and used for advancing innovation and discovery.
• We are increasing our accountability to the American public
We are providing unprecedented transparency into our operations and our performance so that we can share our successes and setbacks with the American public.
