</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>Aviation is the transportation mode that connects nations, cities, businesses, and people to support a growing and vital global economy. Within the United States, aviation is essential to economic well-being. Aviation contributes more than $1.0 trillion annually to the U.S. economy and supports more than 10 million direct and indirect jobs, including more than one million manufacturing jobs. Aviation comprises more than five percent of the total U.S. gross domestic product. In the United States, more than $1.5 trillion in freight is transported by air every year and air travelers alone spend more than $635 billion a year. Globally, the aviation system is growing rapidly with the potential for more than five times as many passengers and 10 times the cargo in 2050 as today. Since our establishment, NASA has continually advanced America’s aviation system to improve our quality of life and productivity on Earth.*+

NASA contributes unique innovations to aviation through our research activities. These innovations serve as key enablers for the role of U.S. commercial aviation in sustaining American commerce and safe, environmentally sustainable mobility, and hence the Nation’s economic well-being. NASA’s role is to explore early stage concepts and ideas, develop new technologies and operational procedures through foundational research, and demonstrate the potential of promising new vehicles, operations, and safety technology in relevant environments. We are focused on the most appropriate cutting-edge research and technologies to overcome a wide range of aeronautics technical challenges for the Nation’s and the world’s current and future air transportation system.

</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>Through the Strategic Review and the Agency’s other performance management processes, NASA reviews recent accomplishments and near term plans for the Agency’s strategic objectives and programs. Under Strategic Objective 2.1, NASA’s Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) advances aeronautics research along six Strategic Thrust, which are research areas guiding ARMD’s response to global trends affecting aviation:


	Strategic Thrust 1: Safe, Efficient Growth in Global Operations
	Strategic Thrust 2: Innovation in Commercial Supersonic Aircraft
	Strategic Thrust 3: Ultra-Efficient Commercial Vehicles
	Strategic Thrust 4: Transition to Low-Carbon Propulsion
	Strategic Thrust 5: Real-Time System-Wide Safety Assurance
	Strategic Thrust 6: Assured Autonomy for Aviation Transformation


&amp;nbsp;

This strategic direction is relatively new (ARMD released their Strategic Implementation Plan in 2015), and the 2015 NASA Strategic Review found that ARMD’s progress towards the strategic portfolio and direction is on track during the limited implementation period. External reports have been positive regarding the portfolio of programs and new strategic direction. In addition, ARMD began implementing a series of new and improved processes and structures. Over the next several years, NASA’s critical next steps are to continue contributing to the six new Strategic Thrusts through the completion of the Technical Challenges in partnership with the aviation community.

The Strategic Review also addresses long-term strategic outcomes, alignment, and key management challenges for each strategic objective, as well as across NASA’s portfolio of activities. There are no known significant events or issues that would prevent ARMD from achieving the strategic objective.

For more information, please see http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/. Highlighted achievements during FY 2015 are detailed in the FY 2015 Agency Financial Report. Additional details on the FY 2015 performance for supporting Performance Goals and Annual Performance Indicators are provided in NASA’s FY 2015 Annual Performance Report. Information on the strategies for achieving this strategic objective can be found in the 2014 NASA Strategic Plan.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>NASA is committed to improving life right here on Earth. Whether developing new aircraft technologies for safer, more efficient air travel, uncovering the complexities of Earth's natural systems, or transferring technologies to the commercial marketplace, NASA has a record of accomplishment in advancing understanding of Earth and helping to improve life for its inhabitants. Every discovery NASA makes, all knowledge gained through our space endeavors, and every advance in technology benefits us on Earth.

We take pride in our ability to inspire people of all ages in the United States and around the world through our pursuits. From landing robots on Mars to teaching in classrooms around the country, we are excited to provide opportunities for people everywhere to engage and participate with us as we push the boundaries of human knowledge and exploration.

NASA will continue to advance research in aeronautics to enable both sustainable and efficient air transportation. Understanding our home planet and improving life on it is central to our mission and is a critical national priority As we make new discoveries about Earth and environmental change, we are protecting our economic vitality and learning how to be better stewards of our home planet.

The effects of climate change are all around us-more severe storms and hurricanes, droughts, and other natural disasters have both a human toll and an economic toll. NASA is working to understand the mechanisms and possible actions Federal, state, and local agencies and organizations and communities can take to minimize the impacts of environmental change.

NASA improves life on Earth by enhancing our economy through aeronautics research to enable more efficient air transportation. NASA has a long and successful history of pioneering technology breakthroughs that underlie most modern aviation systems. The millions of people and trillions of dollars in cargo that fly every year on commercial aircraft are benefiting from years of NASA research and collaboration with other agencies to get to their destinations faster and with greater safety.

NASA contributes to economic vitality and innovation through the transfer of technologies that generate new revenue for private companies or help foster creation of entirely new ventures. We lend expertise, facilities, and innovations to other Federal agencies and entrepreneurs. From emerging commercial launch providers to robotic mining ventures, NASA is working with U.S. companies to find the right way to encourage these nascent industries-whether through helping to advance key technologies, purchasing launch services for crews to low Earth orbit, lending expertise, or providing launch opportunities to small businesses conducting research.

The missions we pursue under this goal address national priorities and directly benefit both our Nation and the global community. For example:

• We are tracking and characterizing the mechanisms of environmental change.

Our assets in space and on Earth are giving us unprecedented insight into the Earth system and how we can minimize the impacts of environmental change.

• We are building the next generation air transport system.

Together with our partners in other agencies, we are bringing to life a future vision that will enable transformative change to the entire air transportation system.

• We are strengthening the economy.

We are transferring knowledge and technologies, which strengthens the economy though innovation, increased revenue, and job creation.

• We are cultivating a strong future workforce.

We are cultivating scientific literacy and a strong future workforce through STEM education.
