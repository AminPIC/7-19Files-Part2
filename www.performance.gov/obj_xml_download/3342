</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>NASA’s education programs work in collaboration with other Federal agencies to improve the quality of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education in the United States, which supports both NASA’s strategic plan and the Administration’s STEM policy. To maintain a globally competitive Nation, our education programs develop and deliver activities that support the growth of NASA’s and the Nation’s STEM workforce, help develop STEM educators, engage and establish partnerships with institutions, and inspire and educate the public. NASA’s contribution to STEM education brings immediate benefits to schools and other institutions, while helping to ensure that future generations of Americans will have the technical skills needed to continue NASA’s missions. We will continue to engage and involve the public and other stakeholders in our activities, and work to build an open, transparent and participatory organization.

Through effective use of our assets in our STEM education programs, we are able to share NASA’s inspirational activities with a broader audience. NASA STEM engagement activities provide learners of all ages the chance to engage in science, technology, engineering, and math, and to understand the value of STEM in their lives. Our learners include: primary, secondary, and higher education students; parents and guardians; formal and informal educators and higher education faculty; and the general public at large. The quality of life we enjoy today is the direct result of the inspiration and achievements of scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and technologists of yesterday. We pursue our objective to ensure future generations of STEM professionals are inspired, experienced, and capable of achieving even greater accomplishments in STEM-related fields. We pursue this objective through a portfolio of NASA-unique STEM experiential learning opportunities (e.g. grants, internships, fellowships, scholarships, workshops) and challenges. These creative applications of NASA-related knowledge encourage innovation, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills, which are characteristics required of our Nation’s future STEM workforce.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Office of Education</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>NASA, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, has highlighted this strategic objective as a focus area for improvement.

Through the Strategic Review and the Agency’s other performance management processes, NASA reviews recent accomplishments and near term plans for the Agency’s strategic objectives and programs. Strategic Objective 2.4 covers NASA’s Office of Education, which performs a critical role in advancing the Nation’s science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and workforce pipeline by working collaboratively with other agencies to engage students, teachers, and faculty in NASA’s missions and unique assets. During the 2015 Strategic Review, NASA found that the Office of Education has made progress against each of the 5 strategies identified for successfully achieving increased impact on the Nation’s STEM education and workforce pipeline.

The Strategic Review also addresses long-term strategic outcomes, alignment, and key management challenges for each strategic objective, as well as across NASA’s portfolio of activities. Strategic Objective 2.4 is rated as a Focus Area for Improvement, because despite the successes noted above, challenges remain within this portfolio. To address these issues, the Office of Education is taking several steps to improve portfolio management as well as strengthening the capacity of NASA Education to build evidence. A key step for performance improvement is that NASA is introducing a new annual performance indicator in FY 2017 that tracks evaluations conducted on educational activities.

For more information, please see http://www.nasa.gov/offices/education/about/index.html. Highlighted achievements during FY 2015 are detailed in the FY 2015 Agency Financial Report. Additional details on the FY 2015 performance for supporting Performance Goals and Annual Performance Indicators are provided in NASA’s FY 2015 Annual Performance Report. Information on the strategies for achieving this strategic objective can be found in the 2014 NASA Strategic Plan.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>NASA is committed to improving life right here on Earth. Whether developing new aircraft technologies for safer, more efficient air travel, uncovering the complexities of Earth's natural systems, or transferring technologies to the commercial marketplace, NASA has a record of accomplishment in advancing understanding of Earth and helping to improve life for its inhabitants. Every discovery NASA makes, all knowledge gained through our space endeavors, and every advance in technology benefits us on Earth.

We take pride in our ability to inspire people of all ages in the United States and around the world through our pursuits. From landing robots on Mars to teaching in classrooms around the country, we are excited to provide opportunities for people everywhere to engage and participate with us as we push the boundaries of human knowledge and exploration.

NASA will continue to advance research in aeronautics to enable both sustainable and efficient air transportation. Understanding our home planet and improving life on it is central to our mission and is a critical national priority As we make new discoveries about Earth and environmental change, we are protecting our economic vitality and learning how to be better stewards of our home planet.

The effects of climate change are all around us-more severe storms and hurricanes, droughts, and other natural disasters have both a human toll and an economic toll. NASA is working to understand the mechanisms and possible actions Federal, state, and local agencies and organizations and communities can take to minimize the impacts of environmental change.

NASA improves life on Earth by enhancing our economy through aeronautics research to enable more efficient air transportation. NASA has a long and successful history of pioneering technology breakthroughs that underlie most modern aviation systems. The millions of people and trillions of dollars in cargo that fly every year on commercial aircraft are benefiting from years of NASA research and collaboration with other agencies to get to their destinations faster and with greater safety.

NASA contributes to economic vitality and innovation through the transfer of technologies that generate new revenue for private companies or help foster creation of entirely new ventures. We lend expertise, facilities, and innovations to other Federal agencies and entrepreneurs. From emerging commercial launch providers to robotic mining ventures, NASA is working with U.S. companies to find the right way to encourage these nascent industries-whether through helping to advance key technologies, purchasing launch services for crews to low Earth orbit, lending expertise, or providing launch opportunities to small businesses conducting research.

The missions we pursue under this goal address national priorities and directly benefit both our Nation and the global community. For example:

• We are tracking and characterizing the mechanisms of environmental change.

Our assets in space and on Earth are giving us unprecedented insight into the Earth system and how we can minimize the impacts of environmental change.

• We are building the next generation air transport system.

Together with our partners in other agencies, we are bringing to life a future vision that will enable transformative change to the entire air transportation system.

• We are strengthening the economy.

We are transferring knowledge and technologies, which strengthens the economy though innovation, increased revenue, and job creation.

• We are cultivating a strong future workforce.

We are cultivating scientific literacy and a strong future workforce through STEM education.
