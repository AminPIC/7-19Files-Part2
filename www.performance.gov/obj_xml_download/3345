&amp;nbsp;
</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>NASA’s contribution to society starts with scientific and technological achievement, but extends much further. We are using our resources to spur exploration as well as the new and robust commercial space market. The continued operation of the ISS is critical to achieving NASA’s and the Nation’s goals in science, technology, and human spaceflight. The ISS is the world’s only orbiting, microgravity research and development (R&amp;amp;D) laboratory where researchers may perform multidisciplinary research and technology development to prepare for our exploration of the solar system. Results of research projects will continue to yield benefits in areas such as human health, telemedicine, physical science, Earth observations, space science, and education programs that inspire future scientists, engineers, and space explorers. The Center for Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS), is the sole manager of the ISS National Laboratory, which is a portion of the ISS, and is working to maximize use of the ISS for research in space. The Administration’s decision to extend ISS operations until at least 2024 will allow us to maximize its potential and maintain American leadership in space.

The ISS is proving to be a catalyst for the growing commercial space enterprise, as well as a critical springboard for our future space exploration goals. NASA is buying hundreds of millions of dollars of cargo flights from new commercial launch services providers. With the collaboration of five space agencies, 15 nations, and private companies, the ISS is a model for cooperation on future human space exploration missions beyond low Earth orbit.

</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Human Exploration Operations Mission Directorate</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>NASA, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, has determined that performance toward this strategic objective is making noteworthy progress.

Through the Strategic Review and NASA’s other performance management processes, NASA reviews recent accomplishments and near-term plans for the Agency’s strategic objectives and programs. The International Space Station (ISS) Program, Human Research Program, and Human Space Flight Operations Program fall under Strategic Objective 1.2. The ISS is the cornerstone of human exploration and operations, and NASA has made significant progress towards greater research utilization. Commercial companies are also successfully flying payloads. A significant recent accomplishment was U.S. Astronaut Scott Kelly and Russian Cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko starting a one-year mission on the ISS, which is twice as long as typical U.S. missions. The one-year crew mission is the latest step in the ISS’ role as a platform for preparing humanity for exploration into deep space. These investigations are expected to yield beneficial knowledge on the medical, psychological, and biomedical challenges faced by astronauts during long-duration spaceflight.

Our critical next steps include maintaining the ISS as a safe and functional on-orbit platform, and continuing commercial and International Partner cargo missions to resupply the ISS. NASA will continue to expand the ISS on-orbit research program, including continuing to increase utilization of internal and external research facilities. In FY 2016, NASA will complete the U.S.-Russian joint one-year human health and performance research project and complete the data collection for the Identical Twins Study. Specific performance measures for the next two years can be found in NASA’s FY 2016 and FY 2017 Annual Performance Plans.

The Strategic Review also addresses long-term strategic outcomes, alignment, and key management challenges for each strategic objective, as well as across NASA’s portfolio of activities. In 10 years, NASA expects to advance benefits to humanity through research, enable a commercial demand-driven market in low Earth orbit; enable long-duration human spaceflight beyond low Earth orbit; and provide a basis for international exploration partnerships. However, NASA experienced resupply setbacks recently that may impact NASA’s Agency Priority Goal for research and utilization of the ISS in the near term. One major challenge for NASA is obtaining a full International Partner agreement for joint operations of the ISS until 2024. Additionally, leveraging the ISS to enable commercialization of low Earth orbit across broad sectors of the U.S. economy is both a challenge and an opportunity for the Agency.

Additional details on the FY 2015 performance for supporting Performance Goals and Annual Performance Indicators are provided in NASA’s FY 2015 Annual Performance Report. Information on the strategies for achieving this strategic objective can be found in the 2014 NASA Strategic Plan.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Expanding the frontiers of knowledge, capability, and opportunity in space is an enduring and core goal for NASA. In the past decade alone, we increased our knowledge of the universe as evidenced by the discovery of more than 2,000 planets in other solar systems. Closer to home, we have expanded our exploration capabilities and sent out robotic sentinels to explore our solar system. The Curiosity rover landed more than 225 million kilometers from Earth and is actively exploring Mars. It has already accomplished its major science goal, discovering a location that could have supported microbial life in the past. We are planning to deepen our knowledge of the working of the interior of planetary bodies by placing a highly sensitive seismometer and associated geophysical instruments on the surface of Mars with the InSight mission. In 2020, we will continue our robotic exploration of Mars with a rover largely built upon the successful Curiosity rover and equipped with new, advanced instruments for in situ studies. It will prepare a scientifically selected cache of Mars samples that may be returned to Earth in the future for detailed analysis seeking possible signs of ancient life.
We are undertaking the detailed examination of near-Earth asteroids to determine what they can tell us about the early solar system, and whether any of these objects pose a threat to Earth. We are expanding our Near Earth Object Observation program, to find candidates for the proposed asteroid mission, and to catalogue asteroids larger than 140 meters across. Specifically, NASA will seek to increase the number of asteroid observations by the amateur astronomer community as a part of the Asteroid Grand Challenge. In 2016, we will launch the OSIRIS-REx mission to robotically approach and return a sample from a carbonaceous asteroid. This will aid in our investigation of planet formation and the origin of life in our solar system, as well as our understanding of asteroids that could impact Earth.
The missions we pursue under this goal help address national challenges and are allowing us to take advantage of unique opportunities to bring benefits to the Nation. For example:

• We are moving forward with critical research and technology demonstrations on the ISS.

Great advances in understanding human health have come from research on the ISS, which
can help prepare us for long-duration space travel, as well as improve the quality of life for aging populations on Earth.

• We are contributing to healthy, cutting-edge manufacturing and aerospace sectors.

For SLS, we are using 3D manufacturing technology to print custom parts for the system, marking a revolution in manufacturing.

• We are enabling a robust commercial space industry.

We are leveraging our public-private partnerships to lower launch costs and create more opportunities for commercial space flight.

• We are adding to the scientific understanding that may be needed to protect Earth.

Our proposed asteroid initiative, comprised of both a bold new mission to an asteroid and a global grand challenge to find all asteroid threats to human populations, will help identify the threats posed by some asteroids as well as teach us how to possibly avoid future impacts.

• We are moving outward, beyond low Earth orbit, into the broader solar system.

We are developing SLS and the Orion to carry astronauts farther into space than humans have ever been.
