</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>NASA invests in cross-cutting, transformational space technologies that have high potential for offsetting mission risk, reducing costs, and advancing existing capabilities, which makes achieving more challenging missions possible. These technologies enable a new class of space missions; strengthen our Nation’s leadership in space-related science, technology, and industrial base; and foster a technology-based U.S. economy.

Drawing on talent from our workforce, academia, small business, and the broader space enterprise, NASA delivers innovative solutions that dramatically improve technological capabilities for our mission and the Nation. Development and infusion of these new capabilities improves the reliability of future missions and is vital to reaching new heights in space and sending American astronauts to new destinations, such as an asteroid or Mars.

</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Space Technology Mission Directorate</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>Through the Strategic Review and the Agency’s other performance management processes, NASA reviews recent accomplishments and near term plans for the Agency’s strategic objectives and programs. Under Strategic Objective 1.7, NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) works to mature crosscutting and innovative space technologies. STMD is making great strides by delivering new technologies and capabilities (for example, completing the first two major demonstration of the Low Density Supersonic Decelerator, advancing the state of the art in high power solar arrays to enable future electric propulsion systems, completing mission infusion review of compression pad technology for Orion Exploration Mission (EM) 1, delivering Robonaut 2 legs and 3D printer hardware to the ISS, and flying PhoneSat missions).

Over the next several years, NASA’s critical next steps are to continue exploring early stage concepts, advancing promising new technologies, and maturing transformative solutions for flight demonstration. This approach will include continued emphasis on portfolio balance and lean, rapid technology development. STMD will also continue to emphasize partnerships within and outside the Agency. Specific performance measures for the next two years can be found in NASA’s FY 2016 and FY 2017 Annual Performance Plans.

The Strategic Review also addresses long-term strategic outcomes, alignment, and key management challenges for each strategic objective, as well as across NASA’s portfolio of activities. In 10 years, NASA plans that the Agency’s current efforts under Strategic Objective 1.7 will lead to advancing technology solutions that address NASA mission challenges and other national needs, as well as the market challenges of providing state-of-the-art commercial space products and services that significantly benefit the commercial space sector. However, STMD foresees several challenges and is pursing risk mitigation strategies for these issues.


	This strategic objective has faced historical funding uncertainty, which creates programmatic planning challenges. STMD strives to remain flexible in an uncertain budget environment.
	STMD pursues high-risk technology development. As is expected in such endeavors, STMD experiences challenges and setbacks. STMD continues to respond to budget constraints; cost, schedule, and performance issues; and other factors with both preventative and corrective actions.
	STMD recognizes the opportunity to further improve the integration of activities and technology transition. To increase the probability of transition, STMD conducts activities such as early stage innovation workshops, is increasing emphasis on SBIR post-Phase II activities, and is investing in tipping point technologies that are particularly promising opportunities for the U.S. commercial space sector.
	Access to space is also a challenge. To demonstrate new technology capabilities in space, STMD relies on rideshare launch capabilities (i.e., as secondary payloads or hosted payloads). Increasing launch costs and limited availability are challenges.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Expanding the frontiers of knowledge, capability, and opportunity in space is an enduring and core goal for NASA. In the past decade alone, we increased our knowledge of the universe as evidenced by the discovery of more than 2,000 planets in other solar systems. Closer to home, we have expanded our exploration capabilities and sent out robotic sentinels to explore our solar system. The Curiosity rover landed more than 225 million kilometers from Earth and is actively exploring Mars. It has already accomplished its major science goal, discovering a location that could have supported microbial life in the past. We are planning to deepen our knowledge of the working of the interior of planetary bodies by placing a highly sensitive seismometer and associated geophysical instruments on the surface of Mars with the InSight mission. In 2020, we will continue our robotic exploration of Mars with a rover largely built upon the successful Curiosity rover and equipped with new, advanced instruments for in situ studies. It will prepare a scientifically selected cache of Mars samples that may be returned to Earth in the future for detailed analysis seeking possible signs of ancient life.
We are undertaking the detailed examination of near-Earth asteroids to determine what they can tell us about the early solar system, and whether any of these objects pose a threat to Earth. We are expanding our Near Earth Object Observation program, to find candidates for the proposed asteroid mission, and to catalogue asteroids larger than 140 meters across. Specifically, NASA will seek to increase the number of asteroid observations by the amateur astronomer community as a part of the Asteroid Grand Challenge. In 2016, we will launch the OSIRIS-REx mission to robotically approach and return a sample from a carbonaceous asteroid. This will aid in our investigation of planet formation and the origin of life in our solar system, as well as our understanding of asteroids that could impact Earth.
The missions we pursue under this goal help address national challenges and are allowing us to take advantage of unique opportunities to bring benefits to the Nation. For example:

• We are moving forward with critical research and technology demonstrations on the ISS.

Great advances in understanding human health have come from research on the ISS, which
can help prepare us for long-duration space travel, as well as improve the quality of life for aging populations on Earth.

• We are contributing to healthy, cutting-edge manufacturing and aerospace sectors.

For SLS, we are using 3D manufacturing technology to print custom parts for the system, marking a revolution in manufacturing.

• We are enabling a robust commercial space industry.

We are leveraging our public-private partnerships to lower launch costs and create more opportunities for commercial space flight.

• We are adding to the scientific understanding that may be needed to protect Earth.

Our proposed asteroid initiative, comprised of both a bold new mission to an asteroid and a global grand challenge to find all asteroid threats to human populations, will help identify the threats posed by some asteroids as well as teach us how to possibly avoid future impacts.

• We are moving outward, beyond low Earth orbit, into the broader solar system.

We are developing SLS and the Orion to carry astronauts farther into space than humans have ever been.
