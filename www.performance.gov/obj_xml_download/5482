</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>Technology and homeland security are inextricably linked. A vast array of interdependent information technology networks, systems, services, and resources enable communication, facilitate travel, power our homes, run our economy and provide essential government services. These systems provide enormous benefits to our society and economy, but they also create new risks and vulnerabilities. DHS must endeavor to keep pace with technology and leverage research and development toward homeland security goals.

We will pursue the following strategies to conduct homeland security research and development:


	Employ scientific study to understand homeland security threats and vulnerabilities by pursuing a research and development strategy that is operationally focused, highly innovative, and founded on building partnerships among operators, scientists, and engineers, and by providing operational support, timely experiments, measurements, testing, evaluation, and analyses of homeland security significance.
	Develop innovative approaches and effective solutions to mitigate threats and vulnerabilities by: 1) providing new capabilities through new technologies and operational process enhancements; 2) offering innovative systems-based solutions to complex problems; and 3) delivering the technical depth and reach to discover, adapt, and leverage scientific and engineering solutions developed by federal agencies and laboratories, state, local, and tribal governments, universities, and the private sector—across the United States and internationally.
	Leverage the depth of capacity in national labs, universities, and research centers by pursuing a mix of basic and applied research to deliver practical tools and analytic products that increase the effectiveness of components and save taxpayer dollars.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>The Nation’s experiences in the years since September 11, 2001 highlight the importance of joining efforts across all levels of society and government into a common homeland security. In considering the evolution of the Department and the ever-changing environment in which it operates, we have identified several key, cross-cutting functional areas of focus for action within the Department that must be accomplished in order for it to successfully execute its core missions. These functions, and the critical activities associated with them, serve as the supporting foundation that underpins all homeland security missions.
These goals also support the Unity of Effort Initiative, which builds important linkages between the Department’s planning, programming, budgeting, and execution processes, ensuring that the Department invests and operates in a cohesive, unified fashion, and makes decisions that are transparent and collaborative to drive the Secretary’s strategic guidance to results.
