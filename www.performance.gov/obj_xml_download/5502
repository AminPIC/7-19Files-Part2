</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>To support priority security requirements in a sustainable way, we must become more efficient and effective across a large and federated structure. As a Department, we must eliminate duplicative processes, develop common platforms, and purchase single solutions. In addition, the safety and security of our country can only be achieved through the hard work and dedication of our employees, with a diverse array of backgrounds, experiences, skills, and ideas. Our workforce serves as the foundation to ensure continued growth of our collective ability to prevent and respond to the threats facing the nation.

We will pursue the following strategies to strengthen service delivery and manage DHS resources:


	Recruit, hire, retain, and develop a highly qualified, diverse, effective, mission-focused, and resilient workforce by implementing programs and resources that focus on four key objectives: 1) building an effective, mission-focused, diverse, and inspiring cadre of leaders; 2) recruiting a highly qualified and diverse workforce; 3) retaining an engaged workforce; and 4) solidifying a DHS culture of mission performance, adaptability, accountability, equity, and results.
	Manage the integrated investment life cycle to ensure that strategic and analytically based decisions optimize mission performance by integrating performance with program plans and budgets that are well justified and balanced to support DHS priorities.
	Manage and optimize financial resources, property/assets, procurements, security, and DHS IT by: 1) strengthening department service delivery in partnership with all components through integration teams to achieve affordable readiness; 2) pursuing strategic sourcing, small business utilization, and acquisition workforce management; and 3) maintaining a Department-wide IT infrastructure that is reliable, scalable, flexible, maintainable, accessible, secure, meets users’ needs, and ensures operational excellence—from the workstation to the data center to the mission application.
	Establish and execute a comprehensive and coordinated DHS health and medical system by providing medical guidance and Department-wide solutions to mitigate adverse health impacts and work-related health risks to support DHS employees and by embedding senior medical advisors with select operational components to develop and implement policies and procedures to improve force health protection, emergency medical services, global health security, and occupational health and wellness.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>The Nation’s experiences in the years since September 11, 2001 highlight the importance of joining efforts across all levels of society and government into a common homeland security. In considering the evolution of the Department and the ever-changing environment in which it operates, we have identified several key, cross-cutting functional areas of focus for action within the Department that must be accomplished in order for it to successfully execute its core missions. These functions, and the critical activities associated with them, serve as the supporting foundation that underpins all homeland security missions.
These goals also support the Unity of Effort Initiative, which builds important linkages between the Department’s planning, programming, budgeting, and execution processes, ensuring that the Department invests and operates in a cohesive, unified fashion, and makes decisions that are transparent and collaborative to drive the Secretary’s strategic guidance to results.
