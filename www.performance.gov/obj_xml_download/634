While the Department’s research programs are its primary driver for learning what works, the Department also seeks to build evidence by incorporating grantee-led evaluations into other programs. Requiring that more discretionary grants build on and generate evidence of effectiveness will increase the likelihood that scarce program dollars have a positive impact on student outcomes. A list of evaluations completed in FY 2015, as well as a summary of other relevant upcoming evaluations, can be found in appendix E.

The Department’s Evidence Planning Group (EPG) continues to identify opportunities for discretionary grant programs to use evidence-related priorities or selection criteria in competitions. In FY 2015, a total of eight competitions in OII, OESE, and OPE encouraged evidence-based projects through eligibility requirements, competitive preference priorities, and selection criteria. In addition, nine competitions in OII, OESE, and OPE asked that applicants design evaluations of their proposed projects that will produce evidence. The Department surpassed the FY 2015 performance target for programs rewarding evidence in grant competitions. In addition, the EPG has met with each of the Department’s grant-making offices to discuss appropriate uses of evidence in FY 2016 competitions. The Department projects that over 10 competitions will reward evidence in their FY 2016 competitions.

The metric above tracks the Department’s progress in incentivizing applicants to build on evidence of “what works” and to generate new evidence in the course of their grants. Two other metrics—one related to the WWC and one to ERIC—track the Department’s progress in reviewing studies of education effectiveness against rigorous standards and in making high-quality education research widely available and easily accessible. The Department believes that progress in these metrics will contribute to the information flow that is essential to promoting promising areas of education research and development.

The WWC reviews and summarizes studies of the effectiveness of education interventions. During FY 2015, the WWC surpassed the Department’s target by reviewing more than 600&amp;nbsp;studies. Reviews of studies submitted by applicants to Department grant competitions contributed to the larger-than-anticipated number of studies reviewed. In addition to its regular reviews of IES-funded research studies, in FY 2015 the WWC also began to review studies produced by the i3 program’s first cohort of grantees. These grantees, originally funded in 2010, began to share their results of the independent evaluations of their projects this past year. The WWC also expanded its capacity to review higher volumes of studies by offering additional reviewer training and awarding a new contract for grant-related study reviews.

Likewise, in FY 2015, ERIC continued to prioritize acquisition of peer-reviewed, full-text education research and secured many new agreements with content providers to enable ERIC to acquire the full text of peer-reviewed research articles supported with FY 2012 or later research funding from IES. This work contributed to surpassing the FY 2015 annual performance target by more than 5,000 full-text, peer-reviewed resources. ERIC also has incorporated a search function that allows users to identify studies in the ERIC database that were reviewed by the WWC and that met standards. In this way, the greater integration of the Department’s WWC and ERIC investments contributes to the “virtuous cycle” of using and producing research evidence.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Achieving the president’s 2020 college attainment goal will require better and stronger systems, powered by reliable and usable information that informs decision making, as well as by innovation.  Through this strategic plan, the Department aims to foster a culture of continuous systems improvement at the national, state, and local levels.  To achieve this goal, the Department will support robust and comprehensive data systems that produce timely, relevant, and understandable information while properly protecting student privacy; strategic use of research, evaluation, and  evidence in decision making at all levels; increased innovation; and effective and systemic use of technology.
 
The foundation for improving systemic capacity is an infrastructure that supports data-driven decision making.  Stakeholders must have access to relevant, useful data in a timely fashion, and the skills to better understand and make use of the data.  With relevant and actionable data and the ability to use it, policymakers and educators will be able to appraise how states, districts, schools, and students are currently performing; measure progress; pinpoint gaps; improve practice; better address student needs; and make sound decisions.  States are developing systems that will yield the valid, reliable data that are essential to achieving these purposes, but there is much more work to do.  The Department will continue helping states develop effective statewide longitudinal data systems, design voluntary common data standards to increase interoperability, and develop the capacity of institutions and staff to utilize data to improve teaching and learning.  These activities will help to generate an accurate picture of student performance and other critical elements, from early learning programs through postsecondary institutions and the workforce. At the same time, the Department will work through the government-wide Open Data Initiative to ensure that its own information and data are accessible to and useable by researchers, analysts, and developers in the general public.
 
Of course, the collection and use of data must be responsible and must appropriately protect student privacy.  Stewards and users of data must remember that data describe real people and ensure that systems protect the rights of those people. But there is no need to sacrifice data-driven decision making to protect student privacy, and the Department will help practitioners in the field ensure they are properly protecting privacy, and communicating with parents and students about the proper use and management of student data.
Systemic improvement also requires research and evaluation so that decision makers at the national, state, and local levels have reliable evidence to inform their actions. The Department aims to support research that will make a difference by giving states, districts, and schools the information and evidence they need to identify the effective practices they need to adopt. This research will also help them focus scarce resources on investments most likely to have the greatest impact and become more dynamic learning organizations.  In service of this, the Department will use its programmatic and research activities to incentivize the creation and use of evidence by stakeholders in the field. In addition, the Department will use evidence to inform its own policymaking and program development, and will work to communicate the findings of its research and evaluation activities to the field in an engaging and relevant way, further increasing their impact.
The goals and actions in this strategic plan sharpen the focus on the need to generate bold and creative solutions, and aim to support innovation in partnership with other federal partners and private organizations with related missions.  The Department will continue to stimulate innovations in education and provide funds needed to accelerate their design and adoption.  It also will work with Congress to fill a gap in the research and development landscape by establishing an advanced research projects agency for education to pursue breakthrough developments in ways not possible using existing Department mechanisms.
 
The Department’s vision for 21st-century learning also requires that schools have a 21st -century technology infrastructure, anchored around high-speed Internet. States, districts, and schools must have such infrastructure to incorporate cutting-edge methods for strengthening curriculum quality and delivery to meet more rigorous college- and career-ready standards; improving student access and engagement; developing comprehensive, formative, and summative assessment systems; and enhancing data management systems.
How will we measure success?  
 
The Department will use the following indicators to measure its success in enhancing the U.S. education system’s ability to continuously improve through better and more widespread use of data, research and evaluation, evidence, transparency, innovation, and technology.

What could hold us back?  What’s beyond our control?  (External Risk Factors)
 
Efforts to ensure that robust, integrated data systems are linked with early childhood, postsecondary, and workforce-level data will be constrained by the amount of time, financial resources, and support available to states to carry out this work.  State and local funding for data systems may be reduced due to continued budgetary pressures at all levels.  Moreover, wide variations in the various data systems present unique challenges for each state.  Some district data systems, for example, far surpass their own state’s data system.  Efforts to ensure that data systems lead to data-driven decision making may also encounter obstacles around privacy concerns that will need to be addressed.
 
The implementation of these strategies depends on the availability of resources for evaluation and research, which are typically more difficult to obtain than resources for services and program implementation.  In addition, many of the activities supporting this goal will be carried out by contractors and grantees, and thus are, in part, dependent on the capacity and quality of research expertise that exists outside the Department.  This variance in capacity may be more pronounced when it comes to interpreting and using evidence to drive decision making. Similarly, the evidence base regarding interventions in some areas is more robust than in others. And some grant programs focus on areas with less-developed evidence bases. At least in the short term, this could affect the amount of Department funding tied to the existence of certain levels of evidence for projects. Additionally, there are the perceived and real challenges states and districts face in implementing programs in ways that can support the strongest possible studies and evaluations of those programs. Some of these challenges can be addressed through Departmental technical assistance, but others may arise.
 
As reflected by Strategic Objective 5.2, one ongoing challenge is to protect privacy while increasing accessibility to relevant information. For its part, the Department will continue to vigilantly safeguard all personally identifiable information while also helping education agencies make useful information available. The Department also will help stakeholders develop best practices in protecting privacy while still driving data-driven decision making. But no system is perfect, and concerns about privacy may deter stakeholders from embracing the use of data, regardless of the actual level of risk presented.  Another risk lies in finding the right balance of information as too much information could make it nearly impossible to find meaning within data. To avoid this problem, the Department must work with stakeholders to prioritize information and to determine what is most likely to help families make choices for their children, help teachers improve student learning, and enable decision makers to improve education institutions.
 
Education funding faces tremendous budgetary pressure across the country, putting investment in new programs, strategies, or processes at risk.  In this time of decreasing budgets, technology infrastructure and other innovations might be seen as luxuries rather than as mission critical.  Because the private sector currently does not find investment in education innovation as attractive as investment in innovation in other sectors, there is limited private funding to help bridge the gaps.  And the promise of technology might be affected by variance in the capacity of states, districts, and schools to plan, implement, and support modern technology networks.
 
[1] “New competitive grant dollars that reward evidence” includes all dollars awarded based on the existence of at least “evidence of promise” in support of a project, per the framework in the Education Department General Administrative Regulations (34 CFR Part 75). Consideration of such evidence appears through: eligibility threshold (e.g., in the Investing in Innovation program); absolute priority; competitive priority (earning at least one point for it); or selection criteria (earning at least one point for it). The percentage is calculated compared to the total new grant dollars awarded, excluding awards made by the Institute of Education Sciences, the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research, and technical assistance centers, with some exceptions.
