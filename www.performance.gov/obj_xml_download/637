</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview></Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Office of Management</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>The Department’s staffing gaps have been successfully reduced and continue to maintain a stable, minimum level of 4–5 percent, which is well below the FY 2015 target level of 15&amp;nbsp;percent. The Department also continues to reduce hiring lead times and completed approximately 68 percent of hiring actions within 90 days from the date the action was received to the tentative job offer. In FY 2015, the Department opened a new career center to assist employees in reaching their career development goals and successfully developed, marketed and deployed a boot-camp style supervisory training course for supervisors and managers. This mandatory three-day Supervisor Essentials course is facilitated by Department subject matter experts and provides new and existing supervisors with the essential tools in a participatory environment that encourages students to develop cross-component networks to share best practices. Additionally, the Department received full OPM certification for its Senior Executive Service performance management program for the first time in eight years.

The Department’s strategic goals are vast: supporting postsecondary education, CTE, adult education, elementary and secondary education, early learning, equity, and continuous improvement of the education system. To achieve its objectives, the Department’s workforce must have the right skills and be led by skilled and engaging supervisors and managers. The Department is enhancing employee productivity by aligning priorities and goals at every level in the organization with the Department’s strategic objectives. The Department has achieved consistent, incremental progress in Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) results. Since 2010, the Department has improved scores in the Employee Engagement Index of the FEVS from 62.6 percent to 68&amp;nbsp;percent in 2015. In FY 2015, the Department implemented a successful engagement strategy that resulted in 50&amp;nbsp;percent of subcomponents increasing their employee engagement scores between 1&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;12&amp;nbsp;percent, and 72 percent of subcomponents achieving employee engagement scores above the governmentwide average.

The Office of Human Resources (OHR) worked with all Departmental offices to prioritize the revision and updating of key human capital policies, conducted extensive outreach efforts to hiring managers, and expanded supervisory and managerial training and development opportunities.

Human capital management plays a critical role in the Department’s ability to fulfill its mission. By effectively planning for workforce changes, addressing skill gaps, and providing timely guidance and hands-on options for recruitment, staffing, and retention, the Department can provide consistent oversight, execution, and support for its programs.
</Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update></Strategic_Objective><Strategic_Goals><Strategic_Goal><id>504</id><strategic_goal_header>U.S. Department of Education Capacity</strategic_goal_header><strategic_goal_statement>Improve the organizational capacities of the department to implement this strategic plan.
</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>To successfully implement this strategic plan, the Department must retool its organizational capabilities and areas of expertise. In particular, transforming the Department means developing a new approach to workforce and succession planning, and raising the competency levels of the employees using a strategic, disciplined and structured approach. To ensure the achievement of mission critical objectives, grants and contract management will be a strategic focus for improvement in long and short-term initiatives. These initiatives will strive to better support grantees in achieving their educational goals while also continuing to hold grantees accountable for meeting financial requirements and legal obligations. To do so, the Department will continue to build the skills and knowledge of its workforce, rethink how it monitors and intervenes with high-risk grantees as well as contractors, enhance workforce productivity through information technology and performance management, and transform the way the Department interacts with states, districts, institutions of higher education, and other grantees across the country. The transformation will result in improved performance results, increased stakeholder collaboration, and higher employee engagement.
How will we measure success?  
The Department will use the following indicators to measure the Department’s success in building the organizational capacities needed to implement this strategic plan.

What could hold us back?  What’s beyond our control?  (External Risk Factors)
To be successful, these human capital initiatives will require support from the Department’s supervisors, managers, and senior leaders.  It will also require updates to internal policies and a strong, productive collaboration with the employees’ union.  In addition, the Department will need to improve upon its commitment to meaningful professional development and succession planning programs as well as the implementation of new technology to support improved collaboration among staff as well as with our grantees and partners.
Risk is inherent in the grants as well as contract management processes; therefore, no amount of improvement will completely eliminate risk.  Risk is greater in areas of innovation, where there are fewer precedents, proven strategies, or track records upon which to draw in the assessment and management of risk.  Data limitations and lack of timeliness can impede the Department’s efforts in managing risk. Implementing unprecedented reform efforts will require states to develop new capacities that support effective teaching, school turnarounds, college- and career-ready standards, and effective use of data.  In addition, states must develop new capacities to communicate and collaborate with each other to share effective practices.  As with many other efforts, states’ abilities to develop and implement these systems may be in jeopardy given the budget environment impacting states and districts.
Maximizing the impact of the Department’s human capital and funding resources may be limited by several factors, including the lack of timely data for analysis.  Additionally, a lack of resources to leverage new technologies and integrate data may limit the Department’s and its grantees’ ability to improve productivity.  These limitations can create challenges for the pace at which new innovations, both technological and others can be developed and deployed.
