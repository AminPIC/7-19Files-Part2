</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview></Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Office of the Chief Information Officer; Office of Management</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>The Department takes pride in fostering a culture where managers and employees have the information and technology to perform their jobs well even when they are not physically onsite. The Department instituted tools and techniques for managers and employees to make performance goal setting, tracking, and feedback a regular work practice throughout the year. Additionally, some supervisors used a best practice performance feedback worksheet with questions tied to FEVS results which enhanced proactive communication and built trust within work teams. The Department also developed a revised telework training course, How to Make Telework Really Work. Training sessions incorporated discussion on changes to the Department’s updated telework policy and provided a forum for managers and employees to ask questions about telework and any concerns regarding space reduction and modernization plans. The Department saw an increase in the use of telework as a viable and effective tool that enabled employees to meet professional responsibilities while also offering a mechanism to reduce work/life stress.

To improve efficiencies and reduce costs associated with the Grant Award Notification process, the Department issued a Grant Bulletin establishing policy and guidance to support e-signature for formula grants.

In FY 2015, the Department implemented the second year of the ED Space Modernization Initiative, finalized space designs for two major subcomponents, and worked with the General Services Administration (GSA) to develop an aggressive construction schedule for the first major phase of the initiative in the Department’s headquarters building. The Department identified business requirements, conducted market research with a broad group of stakeholders, and completed procurement for an automated hoteling and conference room reservation system. Department staff in San Francisco and Chicago were engaged in the process of redefining requirements for new space when current leases expire and worked with GSA to find federally owned space in San Francisco to avoid a large rent increase in 2014; the resulting solution will save the Department $15 million in avoided rent and construction costs in 2017–18. The Department worked closely with its labor union partners to address space challenges in Washington, DC and regional office locations.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>To successfully implement this strategic plan, the Department must retool its organizational capabilities and areas of expertise. In particular, transforming the Department means developing a new approach to workforce and succession planning, and raising the competency levels of the employees using a strategic, disciplined and structured approach. To ensure the achievement of mission critical objectives, grants and contract management will be a strategic focus for improvement in long and short-term initiatives. These initiatives will strive to better support grantees in achieving their educational goals while also continuing to hold grantees accountable for meeting financial requirements and legal obligations. To do so, the Department will continue to build the skills and knowledge of its workforce, rethink how it monitors and intervenes with high-risk grantees as well as contractors, enhance workforce productivity through information technology and performance management, and transform the way the Department interacts with states, districts, institutions of higher education, and other grantees across the country. The transformation will result in improved performance results, increased stakeholder collaboration, and higher employee engagement.
How will we measure success?  
The Department will use the following indicators to measure the Department’s success in building the organizational capacities needed to implement this strategic plan.
U.S. Department of Education Capacity Indicators of Success

Increase the Employee Viewpoint Survey’s employee  engagement index rating
Increase the Employee Viewpoint Survey’s performance culture index rating
Increase the Employee Viewpoint Survey’s leadership and knowledge management index rating
Decrease percentage of A-133 single audits overdue for resolution
Increase compliance rate of contractor evaluation performance reports
Increase percentage of states that annually rate the Department’s technical assistance as helping build state capacity to implement education reforms
Decrease number of ED IT security incidents
Decrease time to hire
Increase effective communication index rating
Decrease ED’s space footprint across the real property portfolio
What could hold us back?  What’s beyond our control?  (External Risk Factors)
To be successful, these human capital initiatives will require support from the Department’s supervisors, managers, and senior leaders.  It will also require updates to internal policies and a strong, productive collaboration with the employees’ union.  In addition, the Department will need to improve upon its commitment to meaningful professional development and succession planning programs as well as the implementation of new technology to support improved collaboration among staff as well as with our grantees and partners.
Risk is inherent in the grants as well as contract management processes; therefore, no amount of improvement will completely eliminate risk.  Risk is greater in areas of innovation, where there are fewer precedents, proven strategies, or track records upon which to draw in the assessment and management of risk.  Data limitations and lack of timeliness can impede the Department’s efforts in managing risk. Implementing unprecedented reform efforts will require states to develop new capacities that support effective teaching, school turnarounds, college- and career-ready standards, and effective use of data.  In addition, states must develop new capacities to communicate and collaborate with each other to share effective practices.  As with many other efforts, states’ abilities to develop and implement these systems may be in jeopardy given the budget environment impacting states and districts.
Maximizing the impact of the Department’s human capital and funding resources may be limited by several factors, including the lack of timely data for analysis.  Additionally, a lack of resources to leverage new technologies and integrate data may limit the Department’s and its grantees’ ability to improve productivity.  These limitations can create challenges for the pace at which new innovations, both technological and others can be developed and deployed.
