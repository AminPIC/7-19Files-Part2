The fundamental purpose of our Armed Forces is to fight and win our Nation’s conflicts. Therefore, it is critical the DoD continually assesses warfighting readiness and capabilities.

The Chairman’s Readiness System (CRS) provides a common framework for conducting commanders’ readiness assessments, blending unit-level readiness indicators with combatant command (COCOM), Service, and Combat Support Agency (CSA) (collectively known as the C/S/As) subjective assessments of their ability to execute the National Military Strategy (NMS).

Specifically, the CRS provides the C/S/As a readiness reporting system measuring their ability to integrate and synchronize combat and support units into an effective joint force ready to accomplish assigned missions.
The Readiness of the Department’s Joint Forces and its ability to respond to a broad spectrum of conflict are collected, managed, assessed, and reported through the CRS.&amp;nbsp; Readiness assessment results are provided on an as needed basis.
