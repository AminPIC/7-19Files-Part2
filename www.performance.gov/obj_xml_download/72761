The Joint Staff will begin FY 2017 with an Implementation Plan for the newly developed Joint Concept for Robotic and Autonomous Systems.&amp;nbsp; The plan is designed to provide a phased approach for the holistic integration of robotic and autonomous systems (RAS) into the DoD over the next 15-20 years.&amp;nbsp; The strategy of the transition plan is to allow contemporary and cutting-edge technology to quickly inform Concepts of Operations (CONOPS) and integrate seamlessly into the joint force and evolve along with the current state of technology thereby increasing the human physical and cognitive performance.
