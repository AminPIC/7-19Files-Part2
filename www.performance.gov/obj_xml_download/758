</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>One of America’s fundamental ideals is that hard work and determination will open the doors to opportunity. However, for too long and for too many people, access to opportunity is still not within reach. Americans all want the same basic things for their families: a safe, affordable place to call home, a quality education for our kids, and access to transportation, jobs, retail, and services. Despite genuine progress and a landscape of communities transformed in the more than 40 years since the Fair Housing Act was enacted, the ZIP code in which a child grows up, all too often, remains a strong predictor of that child’s success. To this end, HUD seeks to significantly increase the number of housing providers, lenders, members of the real estate community, and others that fully comply with the Fair Housing Act and other applicable fair housing and civil rights laws and do not discriminate on any basis prohibited by those laws and regulations. While housing discrimination still takes on blatant forms in some instances, it has become more subtle through the years, resulting in under¬reporting and complicating effective enforcement.&amp;nbsp;

In addition to enforcement, HUD works proactively to make access to important neighborhood assets measurably fairer in neighborhoods where HUD invests, and to ensure that policies and practices are in place to provide equal access to persons with disabilities.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>HUD is designating the Fair Housing objective as making noteworthy progress. On July 16, 2015, HUD published the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) rule, which clarifies the Fair Housing Act’s requirement that Federal housing and urban development programs be implemented in a way that affirmatively furthers the purposes of the Act. The new AFFH regulation aims to fulfill the requirements and the promise of the Fair Housing Act. It marks an important step toward ensuring that everybody is given an equal opportunity to access safe and affordable housing near quality schools, transportation, and jobs. This new rule will provide communities and local decision-makers with the information, tools, and clear guidance they need to comply with their statutory duty to affirmatively further fair housing. HUD will be a supporter as grantees work to meet their own fair housing goals and realize the promise of this bedrock civil rights legislation.

As part of HUD’s effort to discourage discrimination through strong enforcement, on May 26, 2015, HUD announced an agreement with Associated Bank, N.A.&amp;nbsp; to resolve a disparate treatment redlining case.&amp;nbsp; At approximately $200 million, it is the largest settlement of this kind HUD has ever reached. It is also one of the largest redlining complaints brought by the federal government against a mortgage lender.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Housing and community development efforts must address a complex network of individual, social, economic, and environmental factors in order to promote more diverse, inclusive communities and improve the sustainability of neighborhoods, communities, and regions. Many of the neighborhoods hit hardest by the housing and economic crisis—those with the highest rates of foreclosure and job loss—have been racially isolated and among the least sustainable, with limited access to economic opportunity, the longest commuting times to jobs, the most homes that pose health risks, and the poorest quality schools.
It is crucial that the federal government and its local partners effectively coordinate policies related to community development, climate change, energy efficiency, transportation, and disaster preparedness. Today we know that “place” influences outcomes—the place where a person lives is a reliable predictor of his or her long-term health, education, and employment outcomes. Families and individuals living in concentrated poverty experience greater inequity and often, as a result, more dismal outcomes.
Residents of these neighborhoods have limited access to transportation, face health hazards in their homes and communities, suffer from the poorest schools, and have the fewest economic opportunities. In many areas, the spatial mismatch between housing and transportation investments limits access to decent employment and education opportunities for entire neighborhoods. This not only impacts the lives of residents in those communities, but the resulting need to travel greater distances to connect to these resources has a clear impact on the environment as well—from wetland and open space lost to sprawling development patterns to ever increasing greenhouse gas emissions.
To address these problems, Goal 4 focuses explicitly on “place;” on preparing communities for the future of their economy, environment, and community development, through enhanced planning, enforcement, and capacity building—so that all communities are livable for residents and viable in the long term.
