Separation VOW Compliance (Active Duty): Improved communication from senior leadership to the Service members has promoted understanding of VOW compliance requirements among Service members.&amp;nbsp; Note that the VOW Compliance rate reflects only the known eligible Service members, that is – those for whom a DD Form 2958 was received by the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC).&amp;nbsp; Through August fiscal year to date (FYTD) 2015, DMDC received DD Forms 2958 for 80.9% (122,706) of the 151,680 active duty VOW Act eligible separations.&amp;nbsp; Of these 122,706 known eligible Service members, 94.3% were VOW compliant.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, it is ‘unknown’ if the remaining 28,974 Service members were VOW compliant based on the DD Form 2958 data.


Separation Career Readiness Standards (Active Duty): Improved communication from senior leadership to the Service members has likely resulted in Service members better understanding the Career Readiness Standards (CRS) and ensuring they meet the CRS.&amp;nbsp; Note that the CRS compliance rate reflects only the known eligible Service members, that is – those for whom a DD Form 2958 was received by the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC).&amp;nbsp; Through August FYTD 2015, DMDC received DD Forms 2958 for 80.9% (122,706) of the 151,680 active duty VOW Act eligible separations.&amp;nbsp; Of these 122,706 known eligible Service members, 88.4% met CRS or received a warm handover (i.e., a person-to-person connection to services and follow-up resources to meet the needs of the Service member and assist him or her in making a successful transition). Therefore, it is ‘unknown’ if the remaining 28,974 Service members met CRS or received a warm handover based on the DD Form 2958 data.


WII Assigned Recovery Care Coordinator (RCC) within 30 Days:&amp;nbsp; WII Service members assigned to DoD trained RCCs within 30 days of enrollment was 100% for 4Q FY 2015.&amp;nbsp; US Navy met the 100% DoD Priority Goal by increasing the case load requirement of current trained RCCs.&amp;nbsp; 15 of the 17 new hires have completed training; the remaining 2 new hires will complete RCC training scheduled for 26-30 October, 2015.&amp;nbsp;
