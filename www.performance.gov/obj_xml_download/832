</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>Restoring watershed and forest health is central to USDA’s efforts in our national forests and grasslands.&amp;nbsp; USDA will develop and implement National Forest System land management plans and projects to restore and sustain ecosystem function.&amp;nbsp; This includes improving the health of fire-adapted or fire-impaired ecosystems; addressing the spread of insects and diseases that kill trees; restoring wildlife habitat; improving or decommissioning roads; replacing and improving culverts; and rehabilitating streams and wetlands.

On agricultural and grazing lands, USDA will assist private landowners and managers with sustainable land management through conservation programs.&amp;nbsp; USDA provides technical and financial assistance to enable landowners to develop conservation plans and implement effective conservation practices.&amp;nbsp; These efforts restore vegetative cover; implement sustainable agricultural production levels on erosive lands; and improve soil productivity through soil health management.&amp;nbsp; USDA is working to protect forest and agricultural land from conversion to urban and other developed land use through conservation easements and strategic land acquisition.&amp;nbsp; Beyond national forests and agricultural lands, USDA also invests in urban and community forestry programs to improve urban forests and greenspaces.

USDA will work with partners to identify the most environmentally and socially important landscapes, create strategies to protect natural resources, and involve communities in this work.&amp;nbsp; USDA will also prioritize and accelerate research that delivers tools for more effective conservation.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office></Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) helped farmers and ranchers apply conservation practices to almost&amp;nbsp;9 million acres of cropland to improve soil health and almost 26&amp;nbsp;million acres of grazing land and forest land to protect and improve the resource base. In addition, the Farm Service Angency's (FSA)&amp;nbsp;Conservation Reserve Program’s (CRP) which helps to reduce nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment pollution by more than 85 percent annually on all lands enrolled achieved over 2 million acres in wetland practice enrollment in FY 2015. CRP is protecting more than 170,000 stream miles with riparian forest and grass buffers, enough to go around the world 7 times. Since 1985, the program has sequestered an annual average of 49 million tons of greenhouse gases, equal to taking 9 million cars off the road; prevented 9 billion tons of soil from erosion, enough to fill 600 million dump trucks; and reduced nitrogen and phosphorous runoff by 95 and 85 percent,

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>National forests and private working lands provide clean air, clean and abundant water, and wildlife habitat.  These lands sustain jobs and produce food, fiber, timber, and bio-based energy.  Many of our landscapes are scenic and culturally important and provide Americans a chance to enjoy the outdoors.  To sustain these many benefits, USDA works with private landowners to protect and enhance 1.3 billion acres of working lands and manages 193 million acres of national forests and grasslands.  The Department uses an “all-lands” approach to bring people together across ecosystems and property boundaries.  This increases the scale, pace, and effectiveness of conservation and restoration.  Our partners include Federal, Tribal, and state governments; industry; non-governmental organizations, community groups and producers.  Our lands face increasing threats that must be addressed.  USDA’s natural resource-focused strategies are designed to make substantial contributions in the areas described below.
Soil health.  There is a need to grow more food on a shrinking available land base, as global food demand rises and agricultural land is developed for other uses.  From 1982 to 2007, approximately 23 million acres of agricultural land was lost to development.  Improved soil health helps us use available land most productively and increases water quality, resilience to extreme weather, and carbon sequestration.  Soil loss from erosion is one important metric for monitoring soil health.
Climate change.  Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing the U.S. and the world.  Producers are increasingly faced with extreme weather events, ranging from drought to flood. The agriculture sector accounts for 7 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.  Forests and other lands absorb approximately 14 percent of emissions.  However, recent studies project that the forest carbon sink could become a net source of carbon emissions in the next few decades.[1] This decline is primarily due to conversion of forest land area to urban and other developed land uses.
Water quality.  Protecting and improving the nation’s water resources is a priority. In an assessment of the nation’s rivers and streams released by the Environmental Protection Agency, 23 percent of the nation’s river and stream length was rated to be in fair condition, and 55 percent in poor condition.
