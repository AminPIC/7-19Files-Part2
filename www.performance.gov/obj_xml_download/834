</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>Many forests, rangelands, and grasslands are dependent on fire for ecological health. Unfortunately, fires that burn too hot and too large are becoming more prevalent due to climate change, development in fire-prone areas, and other factors.&amp;nbsp; These catastrophic fires harm the environment and threaten communities.&amp;nbsp; To reduce the risk of catastrophic fire, USDA works with the Department of the Interior, other Federal agencies, Tribal and State governments and local law enforcement and emergency preparedness staff on prevention, preparedness, and response.

USDA and its partners will work with communities to assess risks, and develop and implement community plans to improve capability to respond to local wildfires.&amp;nbsp; USDA will also collaborate with public and private forest and rangeland owners to develop and implement hazardous fuels reduction and ecosystem restoration projects.&amp;nbsp; In the national forests and grasslands, land management plans will be designed to restore degraded ecosystems and to allow fire to play a healthy role in fire dependent ecosystems.&amp;nbsp; This will reduce fuel loads, improve wildlife habitat, and sustain healthy ecosystems.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office></Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>ACCOMPLISHMENTS: In FY 2015, the Hazardous Fuels program treated more than 2.3 million acres on National Forest System (NFS) and adjacent lands both inside and outside the wildland-urban interface (WUI). The Forest Service targeted the highest priority WUI acres for treatment, focusing on the communities that have implemented Community Wildfire Protection Plans.

CHALLENGES: The Forest Service is committed to restoring the resilience and diversity of fire-adapted ecosystems on the landscape, consistent with public safety needs. Wildfires continue to be larger and more difficult to suppress due to the effects of a changing climate, persistent drought and hazardous fuel conditions, and the increased size and complexity of housing developments adjacent to WUI.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>National forests and private working lands provide clean air, clean and abundant water, and wildlife habitat.  These lands sustain jobs and produce food, fiber, timber, and bio-based energy.  Many of our landscapes are scenic and culturally important and provide Americans a chance to enjoy the outdoors.  To sustain these many benefits, USDA works with private landowners to protect and enhance 1.3 billion acres of working lands and manages 193 million acres of national forests and grasslands.  The Department uses an “all-lands” approach to bring people together across ecosystems and property boundaries.  This increases the scale, pace, and effectiveness of conservation and restoration.  Our partners include Federal, Tribal, and state governments; industry; non-governmental organizations, community groups and producers.  Our lands face increasing threats that must be addressed.  USDA’s natural resource-focused strategies are designed to make substantial contributions in the areas described below.
Soil health.  There is a need to grow more food on a shrinking available land base, as global food demand rises and agricultural land is developed for other uses.  From 1982 to 2007, approximately 23 million acres of agricultural land was lost to development.  Improved soil health helps us use available land most productively and increases water quality, resilience to extreme weather, and carbon sequestration.  Soil loss from erosion is one important metric for monitoring soil health.
Climate change.  Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing the U.S. and the world.  Producers are increasingly faced with extreme weather events, ranging from drought to flood. The agriculture sector accounts for 7 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.  Forests and other lands absorb approximately 14 percent of emissions.  However, recent studies project that the forest carbon sink could become a net source of carbon emissions in the next few decades.[1] This decline is primarily due to conversion of forest land area to urban and other developed land uses.
Water quality.  Protecting and improving the nation’s water resources is a priority. In an assessment of the nation’s rivers and streams released by the Environmental Protection Agency, 23 percent of the nation’s river and stream length was rated to be in fair condition, and 55 percent in poor condition.
