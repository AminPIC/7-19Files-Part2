</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>The Department detects and quickly responds to new invasive species and emerging agricultural and public health situations through a three-part strategy that involves (1) identifying threats overseas and working to prevent them from coming to the United States, (2) providing training and expertise to identify threats at ports of entry, and (3) working to eradicate pests and diseases or manage them to limit the damage done if they are already in the United States.

Where possible, USDA eradicates or manages existing agricultural pests and diseases and wildlife damage. The Department also develops and applies more effective scientific methods to prevent, detect, eradicate, or manage pests and diseases. These efforts contribute to the overall agricultural health of the Nation and the world.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office></Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>ACHIEVEMENTS:&amp;nbsp;In FY 2015, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) addressed a variety of pests and diseases and worked to develop ways to mitigate the damages caused by significant threats to U.S. agricultural production. For example, APHIS took the lead in responding to the outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), the largest animal health emergency in U.S. history.

CHALLENGES: USDA must continually prioritize the list of major pest and disease threats. These threats are increasing both domestically and internationally. The Department’s surveillance efforts will need to be adjusted to respond to these threats.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>A plentiful supply of safe and nutritious food is essential to the well-being of every family and the healthy development of every child in America. Science has established strong links between diet, health, and productivity.  Even small improvements in the average diet may yield significant health and economic benefits.  Yet we know that for many American families, food and nutrition issues remain serious problems.
Food insecurity.  While most American households have access at all times to enough nutritious food for an active and healthy lifestyle, food insecurity and the risk of hunger remain serious problems. The latest data show that over 17 million American households, including over 8 million households with children, had difficulty putting enough food on the table at some point during 2011. Even more alarming, in more than 350,000 households, with more than 800,000 children, one or more children simply did not get enough to eat.  At times during the year, these children were hungry, skipped meals, or went whole days without food.
Poor diet and obesity.  Poor dietary habits and a lack of physical activity contribute to serious health conditions, perhaps the most troubling of these conditions is childhood obesity.  Over the last 30 years, the childhood obesity rate has more than tripled.[1] This has serious implications for the Nation’s future. Children who start out life obese have greater struggles with their weight in later years. In fact, 80 percent of teenagers who are obese remain obese as adults and are at risk for coronary heart disease, hypertension, and heightened risk of stroke, diabetes, and some cancers.[2]  This has serious implications for the Nation’s future.  Beyond the physical suffering such diseases cause, obesity-related health complications can increase medical costs to America’s health care system and decrease overall productivity.
Food safety.  While the US food supply system is one of the safest in the world, foodborne illness is still a common, costly—yet largely preventable—public health problem.  Many different disease‑causing microbes, or pathogens, can contaminate foods, so there are many different foodborne infections.  Today, as many as one in six Americans experience a foodborne illness annually[3], meaning they get sick by consuming contaminated foods or beverages.
