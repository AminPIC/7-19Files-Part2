</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>USDA will work through its natural resource conservation and energy programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and sequester carbon, while leading adaptation efforts. This supports the Administration’s goal to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020.

USDA will encourage voluntary practices to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions.&amp;nbsp; These include conservation tillage; manure and nutrient management; fertilizer efficiency; planting trees; minimizing deforestation; increasing energy efficiency in agriculture and rural development; and developing renewable sources of energy.&amp;nbsp; Forest restoration, along with conservation easements and land acquisition, will help maintain forests as a net carbon sink.

The Department will assist rural communities, producers, resource managers, and community planners to develop and implement climate adaptation strategies.&amp;nbsp; Impacts that are already appearing include changing water flow, availability, and quality; fire risk; and extreme weather events. USDA will monitor impacts and help implement adaptations (e.g., measuring changes in water flow and then installing stream buffers or upgrading culverts to handle increased water overflow).

The Department conducts and invests in research to inform climate change policy and mitigation and adaptation strategies, tools and technologies.&amp;nbsp; USDA will evaluate the effects of conservation actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to identify effective and economic approaches.&amp;nbsp; USDA is supporting plant variety and animal breed development that maximize carbon sequestration and can adapt to climate change.&amp;nbsp; Work is also underway to develop methods and technical guidelines to measure and model the effects of climate change on ecosystem services and to conduct greenhouse gas inventories of the urban forest and agriculture sector.&amp;nbsp; The Department and its partners will make research outcomes widely available through outreach and extension networks.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office></Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>ACHIEVEMENTS:&amp;nbsp;The national forests and grasslands have made significant progress in their implementation of the Forest Service’s Climate Change Performance Scorecard, with 89 percent of national forests and grasslands in compliance with a climate change adaptation and mitigation strategy in FY 2015.&amp;nbsp;In addition, in FY 2015, USDA announced the Building Blocks for Climate Smart Agriculture and Forestry, a plan to help farmers, ranchers, and forest land owners respond to climate change.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

CHALLENGES:&amp;nbsp; As USDA continues to build compliance with the scorecard dimensions/actions, maintaining resilient national forests and grasslands may become more challenging in the future as climate change effects become more pronounced.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>National forests and private working lands provide clean air, clean and abundant water, and wildlife habitat.  These lands sustain jobs and produce food, fiber, timber, and bio-based energy.  Many of our landscapes are scenic and culturally important and provide Americans a chance to enjoy the outdoors.  To sustain these many benefits, USDA works with private landowners to protect and enhance 1.3 billion acres of working lands and manages 193 million acres of national forests and grasslands.  The Department uses an “all-lands” approach to bring people together across ecosystems and property boundaries.  This increases the scale, pace, and effectiveness of conservation and restoration.  Our partners include Federal, Tribal, and state governments; industry; non-governmental organizations, community groups and producers.  Our lands face increasing threats that must be addressed.  USDA’s natural resource-focused strategies are designed to make substantial contributions in the areas described below.
Soil health.  There is a need to grow more food on a shrinking available land base, as global food demand rises and agricultural land is developed for other uses.  From 1982 to 2007, approximately 23 million acres of agricultural land was lost to development.  Improved soil health helps us use available land most productively and increases water quality, resilience to extreme weather, and carbon sequestration.  Soil loss from erosion is one important metric for monitoring soil health.
Climate change.  Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing the U.S. and the world.  Producers are increasingly faced with extreme weather events, ranging from drought to flood. The agriculture sector accounts for 7 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.  Forests and other lands absorb approximately 14 percent of emissions.  However, recent studies project that the forest carbon sink could become a net source of carbon emissions in the next few decades.[1] This decline is primarily due to conversion of forest land area to urban and other developed land uses.
Water quality.  Protecting and improving the nation’s water resources is a priority. In an assessment of the nation’s rivers and streams released by the Environmental Protection Agency, 23 percent of the nation’s river and stream length was rated to be in fair condition, and 55 percent in poor condition.
