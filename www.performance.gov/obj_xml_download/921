</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>High-growth businesses create almost all of the net new jobs in the economy today.&amp;nbsp; Through longer-term “patient” capital, growth accelerators and regional innovation clusters, federal research and development (R&amp;amp;D) grants, and export assistance, the SBA plays a critical role in the ongoing success of high-growth small businesses.&amp;nbsp; These high-growth investments provide opportunities for small businesses to create jobs and sustain the cycle of American entrepreneurship and innovation.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Office of Investments and Innovation (OII)</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>In FY 2015, the SBA met its goal of committing $2.5 billion in debenture funds to SBICs.&amp;nbsp; The Agency licensed 25 new SBIC funds with an average licensing time of 8.4 months and put in place a new tracking system, identifying processing times for each stage of review.&amp;nbsp; This new system has allowed the program to quantify and qualify its performance with regards to customer service and to identify areas needed for improvement.&amp;nbsp; To reduce licensing times, the SBA is reducing delays within its control and communicating with applicants clearly and promptly regarding actions required on their part.&amp;nbsp; In addition, the SBA continued development of an SBIC web-based system to modernize the business model, encourage potential applicants, streamline processes, and reduce redundancy or duplicative efforts.&amp;nbsp; SBIR is planning to build its solicitation portal and upgrade its database to support additional data collection for performance analysis.&amp;nbsp; The SBIR and STTR programs’ current authorization expires at the end of FY 2017.&amp;nbsp; The Agency requests the reauthorization for both programs, often referred to as America’s Seed Fund, be extended as they support the growth of small, high-tech businesses.&amp;nbsp; The programs have been responsible for establishing thousands of advanced technologies and providing the first funding to many now prominent large businesses.
