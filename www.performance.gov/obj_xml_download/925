</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>Taxpayers, including entrepreneurs and small business owners, expect that their tax dollars are being used wisely.&amp;nbsp; SBA programs give taxpayers a strong “bang for the buck,” and the Agency will continue to find ways to mitigate risk while ensuring that small businesses have access to and fully benefit from its programs.&amp;nbsp; With an outstanding loan portfolio of over $100 billion, oversight of small businesses’ eligibility in tens of billions of government contract set-asides, a network of hundreds of grantee partners delivering counseling and training to over a million clients a year, and direct fiscal responsibility for the annual budget, the SBA has an extraordinary responsibility to taxpayers to mitigate risk and conduct oversight of its programs.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>OCA, GCBD, OED</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>The SBA continued efforts to mitigate risk.&amp;nbsp; Regarding lender oversight, the Agency performed 378 analytical risk-based credit reviews which provided oversight of loan performance, credit scores, and compliance with SBA loan program requirements.&amp;nbsp; The SBA conducted a combination of analytical and file assessments and reviewed 66 entrepreneurial development resource partners.&amp;nbsp; The Agency provided these partners with training, classroom instruction, and educational materials to ensure that programs properly use grant funds.&amp;nbsp; The SBA met its HUBZone and 8(a) Business Development review targets and ensured staff received training in order to provide small businesses with a better understanding of program eligibility requirements and compliance reviews.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, the SBA continued to be challenged by ineligible HUBZone firms that increase risk for the small business community.&amp;nbsp; Continued monitoring and enforcement will help mitigate risk to the Agency and taxpayers

Meeting and exceeding the federal government’s small business procurement goals continues to be an Administration priority.  Federal contracting with small businesses is a win-win.  Small businesses get the revenue they need to grow their businesses and create jobs, and the federal government gets the opportunity to work with some of America’s most innovative and nimble small businesses, often times with a direct line to the CEO.
In FY 2012, the federal government made real progress toward the 23 percent goal, with 22.25 percent or $89.9 billion in federal contracting dollars going to small businesses compared to 21.65 percent in FY 2011, with significant impact in key areas:
For the first time, more agencies than ever before met or surpassed all of their prime contracting goals.
Also, for the first time, the federal government exceeded the goal for service disabled veterans.
The federal government had the highest percentage of contracts going to Small Disadvantage Businesses to date.
As a result of a government wide focus on increasing small business contracting opportunities, during President Obama’s first term (FY2009 - FY2012) the federal government awarded $376.2 billion in federal contracting dollars to small businesses.  This is a $48.1 billion increase over the four preceding years even as we have seen reduced spending overall.
Also, since President Obama took office, the SBA has supported more than $132.61 billion in Federal government contracting dollars to small disadvantaged businesses. This represents a 36.6 percent increase when compared to the prior Administration. Under the Bush Administration’s first term, $97.10 billion in federal government contracting dollars were awarded to small disadvantaged businesses.
Although we have seen marked success over the last few years, we know more must be done.  Many challenges exist for small businesses seeking to enter the federal procurement marketplace.
The unpredictable and changing budget climate is a challenge for small businesses, and SBA is working hard to create an environment where small businesses can be successful in the federal procurement marketplace.
The instability and ambiguity caused by Continuing Resolutions make it difficult to agency acquisition staff to plan effectively for small business utilization.
Entering the federal supply chain can often be a lengthy and arduous process for many small businesses.
SBA’s GCBD unit must implement effective and efficient strategies to monitor the agencies’ progress to goal, support small businesses interested in working with the government and encourage agencies to improve data quality when reporting their contracting activities.  SBA will increase its efforts to collaborate with and hold federal agencies accountable to achieving their goals.
