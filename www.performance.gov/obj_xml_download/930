</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>The programs put in place under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)[1], along with other emergency measures put into place by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), helped prevent the collapse of the U.S. financial system in 2008.&amp;nbsp; With a stabilized national economy showing steady growth, Treasury must finish the course and wind down these emergency measures.&amp;nbsp; We aim to wind down these programs in a manner that balances speed of exit with maximized taxpayer return.

</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office>Domestic Finance</Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>The emergency financial crisis response programs continue to wind down effectively.&amp;nbsp; In December 2014, the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) fully liquidated its investment in Ally Financial and realized cumulative receipts of $19.6 billion ($2.4 billion more than invested).&amp;nbsp; The ultimate cost to taxpayers of TARP programs dropped from the FY 2009 estimate of $341.0 billion to $37.2 billion as of September 2015.&amp;nbsp; TARP’s foreclosure prevention programs provided more than 1.5 million homeowners with permanent mortgage modifications, which equates to approximately $38.7 billion in realized monthly mortgage payment savings for these homeowners.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Economic growth stimulates opportunity, mobility, and security for Americans; and allows citizens and businesses to have more confidence in the safety and soundness of the financial system.  Treasury is committed to promoting these ends over the next four years.
 
In late 2008 and early 2009, Treasury put in place a set of emergency programs to help halt a historic financial crisis, restore confidence in the economy, and restart economic growth.  In 2010, Congress passed and the President signed into law comprehensive regulatory reform to address key gaps and weaknesses in the financial system and to better protect consumers against fraud and abuse.[1]  In the last four years, Treasury has led the Administration’s efforts to implement these financial reforms and bring stability back to the domestic economy.
 
Looking ahead to the next four years, Treasury will continue its work promoting domestic stability in response to the financial crisis, building and strengthening domestic financial institutions and markets, and identifying emerging issues requiring Treasury leadership.  Treasury will work to improve the health of the American workforce by promoting major initiatives that focus on job and skill creation and growing the tax base.  Treasury also aims to stimulate domestic economic growth by facilitating commerce and promoting savings, access to credit, and affordable housing options.
