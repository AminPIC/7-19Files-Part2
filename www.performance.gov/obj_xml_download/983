</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>The operation of the Nation’s transportation system depends on a highly skilled and qualified workforce, now and for the foreseeable future.&amp;nbsp; To be successful in addressing unmet infrastructure needs, we will need a broad spectrum of skilled workers.&amp;nbsp; As demand for transportation services increase, both public and private sector transportation organizations face the ever increasing difficulty of finding qualified workers and managers to fill priority occupations.&amp;nbsp; We will collaborate with our partners in government agencies, private and public employers, educational institutions, and workforce and labor organizations to identify and advance career and technical education pathways to transportation jobs, support science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and transportation-related academic and certification programs for K-12 students, and improve pathways into various levels of transportation occupations for all segments of the population.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Our goal is to support the U.S. economy by fostering strategic investments that will serve the traveling public and facilitate freight movement now and in the future. Transportation enables economic activity, quality of life, connected communities, and ladders of opportunity to education, opportunities, and services. In order to support the lives and economies of neighborhoods, regions, and the Nation, we must invest wisely in transportation. Our central strategies for achieving maximum economic returns on our policies and investments include leading the development of intercity, high-speed passenger rail and a competitive air transportation system; increasing travel time reliability in freight-significant highway corridors; improving the performance of freight rail and maritime networks; advancing transportation interests in targeted markets around the world; expanding opportunities in the transportation sector for small businesses; and creating a dynamic workforce.
