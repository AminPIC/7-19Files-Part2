</Strategic_Objective_Statement><Strategic_Objective_Overview>DOT has responsibility for a number of modal emergency preparedness programs that provide the Department of Defense (DOD) and civilian agencies with assured access to commercial transportation during times of national emergency. We will continue to maintain government-owned transportation assets, and provide access to commercial transportation assets for critical support for defense mobility and emergency response; we will maintain steadfast defense readiness across all operating administrations in their respective national security responsibilities through interagency cooperation and drills with the DOD, Department of Homeland Security, and other State and local agencies.
</Strategic_Objective_Overview><Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office></Strategic_Objective_Lead_Office><Strategic_Objective_Progress_Update>Last year, agencies were required to review progress made toward strategic objectives using the agency Strategic Plan, and release summary results on Performance.gov in February 2015. The agencyâ€™s strategic review considers performance goals and other evidence, as well as challenges, risks, and external factors that may have affected the outcomes. OMB works with agencies to determine which strategic objectives require focused improvement or noteworthy progress relative to other strategic objectives. Because the Department of Transportation released their strategic plan late in 2014, the Department did not complete a strategic review in 2014, but is expected to conduct the review in the future.
