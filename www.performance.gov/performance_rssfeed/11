    <title>Department of State and USAID</title>
    <link>https://www.performance.gov/Department%20of%20State%20and%20USAID</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;The shared mission of the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is to shape and sustain a peaceful, prosperous, just, and democratic world, and foster conditions for stability and progress for the benefit of the American people and people everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department and USAID have developed a strategic approach to accomplish their shared mission that focuses on robust diplomacy and development as central to solving global problems. The Department and USAID’s 2010 Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) described this approach as a comprehensive effort to identify the capabilities needed to strengthen and elevate diplomacy and development as key pillars of the national security strategy, alongside defense.  The 2015 QDDR builds on the foundation established by the 2010 review as a part of the Department and USAID’s processes of continuous improvement, with a focus on emerging policy and management priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For additional information on programs of the Department of State and USAID, please see the Congressional Budget Justification Volume 1: Department of State Operations and the Congressional Budget Justification Executive Summary for Function 150 &amp;amp; Other International Programs. &lt;/p&gt;
