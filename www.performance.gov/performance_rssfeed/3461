    <title>Restructure the relationship and interactions between the Department and the national laboratories and sites</title>
    <link>https://www.performance.gov/Restructure%20the%20relationship%20and%20interactions%20between%20the%20Department%20and%20the%20national%20laboratories%20and%20sites</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Restructure the relationship and interactions between the Department and the national laboratories and sites to ensure the continued status of the national laboratories as world-class research institutions best able to achieve DOE’s mission, maximize the impact of federal R&amp;amp;D investment in the laboratories, accelerate the transfer of technology into the private and government sectors, and better respond to opportunities and challenges.  In support of this goal, DOE will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Establish the National Laboratory Policy Council to address high-level policy challenges and develop initiatives to build and focus the laboratory system on critical economic, research and national security priorities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish the National Laboratory Operations Board to address operational and administrative issues and enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of DOE’s management of the national laboratories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve stewardship of national assets across the national laboratories and DOE operating sites to assure that DOE physical plants and their operating practices comply with DOE Directives and achieve Administration priority initiatives by end of FY 2015&lt;/li&gt;
