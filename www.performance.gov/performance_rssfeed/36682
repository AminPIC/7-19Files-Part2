    <title>Transition to Veterans </title>
    <link>https://www.performance.gov/Transition%20to%20Veterans%20</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Our Nation should provide the best support possible to those who keep our country free and strong as they transition to civilian life, especially during this time of planned structural Department of Defense (DoD) reorganizations.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By September 30, 2017, DoD will improve the career readiness of Service members transitioning to civilian life by: 1) ensuring at least 85% of eligible active duty Service members and 85% of eligible reserve component Service members complete the following required transition activities prior to separation from active duty: pre-separation counseling, a Department of Labor employment workshop, and Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits briefings; 2) verifying that at least 85% of eligible active duty Service members and 85% of eligible reserve component Service members meet established Career Readiness Standards or received a warm handover to appropriate partner agencies prior to separation from active duty; 3) accelerating the transition of recovering Service Members into Veteran status by reducing the disability evaluation processing time; and 4) supporting the seamless transition of recovering Service Members by sharing active recovery plans with the VA.&lt;/p&gt;
