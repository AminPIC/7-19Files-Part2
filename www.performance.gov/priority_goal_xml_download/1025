			Improve client and stakeholder awareness of, and access to, Veterans benefits and health care services.&amp;nbsp;By September 30, 2015, VA will increase the use of virtual service options by increasing the&amp;nbsp;percent of claims received electronically, by increasing the number of accredited Veterans service officers registered on the Stakeholder Enterprise Portal, by increasing the number of registered eBenefits users, and by increasing the percent of patients who access VA health care using a virtual format such as video telehealth or online services.

			Indicators:

			
				
				Increase the annual percent of disability compensation claims received virtually/electronically from a baseline of 2 percent in FY 2013, to 12 percent in FY 2014 and 20 percent in FY 2015.
				
				
				Increase the number of accredited Veterans advocates who are registered users on the Stakeholder Enterprise Portal (SEP) from a baseline of 1,000 in FY 2013, to 2,000 in FY 2014 and 3,500 in FY 2015.
				
				
				Increase the number of registered eBenefits users to 3.8 million in FY 2014 and 5 million in FY 2015.
				
				
				Increase the percent of patients who access VA health care using a virtual format (e.g., video, smart phone, or online services) from 23 percent baseline utilization in FY 2013, to 30 percent in FY 2014 and 35 percent in FY 2015.
				
			
			
		
	

</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>VA’s focus in Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 is to deliver seamless and integrated services while increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of virtual access. &amp;nbsp;To achieve the best possible outcomes for Veterans, Servicemembers, and eligible beneficiaries, VA will improve access to, and encourage the use of, its virtual benefits and services.&amp;nbsp; VA and Department of Defense (DoD) have established a jointly supported portal known as eBenefits, which allows Veterans, Servicemembers, and other eligible beneficiaries to access and submit information when, where, and how they want.

The development and proliferation of virtual access to care supports an organizational approach that is personalized, proactive, and patient-driven.&amp;nbsp; VA virtual health services use technology and health informatics to provide Veterans with better access and more effective care management.&amp;nbsp; Advances in virtual care expand where health care services can be accessed, reduce the need for travel to medical facilities, and transform VA’s delivery of health care and its effect on patients’ health outcomes.

</next_steps><progress_update>Electronic Claims Filing:&amp;nbsp; As of September 30, 2015, the percentage of disability compensation claims received electronically by VA grew to 12.5 percent; an increase of 1.3 percentage points over the third quarter of FY 2015.&amp;nbsp; While the cumulative percentage for the fiscal year is below target, progress is being made, as demonstrated by a peak of 16.2 percent in the month of August 2015.&amp;nbsp; During the fourth quarter FY 2015, 40,867 compensation claims and 42,789 dependency claims were submitted electronically.

eBenefits:&amp;nbsp; As of September 30, 2015, the eBenefits portal has 5,160,568 registered users.&amp;nbsp; Since June 30, 2015, 247,969 new individuals obtained access to eBenefits.&amp;nbsp; This represents a 5-percent increase.&amp;nbsp; eBenefits met and exceeded the target for this quarter.

SEP:&amp;nbsp; SEP has 3,299 Veterans Service Organization (VSO) representatives registered as of September 30, 2015, representing 90 unique organizations.&amp;nbsp;

Since June 30, 2015, 600 new individuals obtained access to SEP.&amp;nbsp; This represents a 22.2 percent increase over the previous quarter.&amp;nbsp; VSOs, attorneys, and claim agents are actively submitting claims electronically on behalf of claimants via SEP.&amp;nbsp; The SEP electronic claim receipts target is 2.2 percent of the overall 20-percent goal for FY 2015 electronic claim receipts.&amp;nbsp; During this reporting period, electronic claim receipts via SEP grew to 3 percent, exceeding the goal of 2.2 percent.

Virtual Care Measure (VCM):&amp;nbsp; As of September 30, 2015, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) had a combined total of 2,297,473 individuals accessing care using a virtual format.&amp;nbsp; This is a 3.44&amp;nbsp; percent increase over third quarter FY 2015 and exceeds the 35 percent target for fourth quarter FY 2015.&amp;nbsp; VHA exceeded the FY 2015 overall goal of 35 percent by 4.63 percent.&amp;nbsp; VCM covers a number of tools, such as:&amp;nbsp; Home Telehealth, Secure Messaging, and electronic consults (e-consult).&amp;nbsp; Secure messaging makes up the greatest portion of VCM users, giving Veterans instant access to their health care team.&amp;nbsp; Telehealth is the next most frequent VCM used within VA, providing convenient care to Veterans directly in their homes and communities.

Specialty Care Services (SCS) currently provides consultation on one component in VCM.&amp;nbsp; Specialty Care Access Network-Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (SCAN-ECHO) is an initiative for ongoing education and training for primary care providers (PCP), as well as a means to provide virtual, clinical consultation without the patient present.&amp;nbsp; PCPs present cases to a team of specialty care clinicians.&amp;nbsp; These case presentations are usually submitted as a consult; this component of&amp;nbsp; SCAN-ECHO is counted in the VCM.&amp;nbsp; However, the overarching goal of this program is to increase the knowledge and skills of PCPs and their teams to provide increased care in community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs), particularly those in rural areas where specialty input would require travel or follow up with non-VA clinicians, which could decrease continuity and care coordination.&amp;nbsp; Over time, PCPs will increase their capacity to care for patients with complex medical conditions in local CBOCs.&amp;nbsp; This aspect of SCAN-ECHO is not a component of the VCM.&amp;nbsp; This initiative now exists in 34 medical and surgical specialty areas and is coordinated between SCS, Rural Health, and other VHA partners to provide education, consultation, and clinical support to PCPs and their teams through video-teleconferencing (v-tel).&amp;nbsp; While neither e-consult nor SCAN-ECHO has a specific FY 2015 goal, both programs contribute to the overall VCM.&amp;nbsp;

In FY 2015, SCAN ECHO held 417 clinics, involving 834 total presentations.&amp;nbsp; E-consults have transitioned to field and clinical operations sustainment.&amp;nbsp; Management of e-consults is completely field based and impacted by consult policy developed through the Access and Clinic Administration Program.&amp;nbsp; In FY 2015, e-consults averaged 17.60 percent of all similar consult request responses in the same locations and services.&amp;nbsp; In FY 2015, 577 new e-consults clinics were initiated in 56 different specialties and 431 were infacilities receiving support.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In total, 504,881 e-consults were completed in FY 2015.

Secure Messaging (SM):&amp;nbsp; As of September 30, 2015, My HealtheVet has 3,359,494 registrants marking a 12 percent increase to the fiscal year baseline and exceeding the end of fiscal year target of 10 percent.&amp;nbsp; As of September 30, 2015, My HealtheVet has 1,643,769 patients who opted in for SM, marking a 50 percent increase to the FY 2015 baseline and exceeding the end of fiscal year target of 35 percent.

VA Telehealth Programs:&amp;nbsp; VA Telehealth Programs continue to expand and are a priority in the Department's commitment to increasing access to care for Veterans, especially in rural and remote locations.&amp;nbsp;

In FY 2015, 6,300 Veterans accessed VA care directly from their homes via Clinical Video Telehealth (CVT).&amp;nbsp; This represents a growth of more than 2,000 Veterans or 50 percent over that which was achieved in FY 2014.&amp;nbsp; During FY 2015, Telemental Health CVT provided 20,500 encounters into the home to more than 3,400 Veterans; this represents an 84 percent growth of encounters provided to&amp;nbsp; 77 percent&amp;nbsp; more Veterans compared to FY 2014.&amp;nbsp; As they did last year, Veterans can continue to use this service to access their VA healthcare team through webcams, personal computers, laptop computers, and&amp;nbsp; iPad tablets.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, Telehealth Services continues to distribute CVT Tablets (please see CVT Tablets section below) with peripheral clinical devices (e.g., stethoscope, pulse oximeter, blood pressure cuff, thermometer) to Veterans who need these technologies at home to connect to their VA care team via CVT.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;


	Mental Health via CVT expanded access to an additional 13,900 Veterans (13 percent increase) in FY 2015.&amp;nbsp; A total of 122,700 Veterans were able to access Mental Health via CVT during FY 2015.
	The National TeleMental Health Center had 651 uniques with 2,912 encounters, compared to 698 uniques and 3,615 encounters for all of FY 2014.
	CVT Transplant evaluations have increased from 180 uniques with 317 encounters in all&amp;nbsp; of FY 2014 to EOFY 2015 of 337, uniques with 382 encounters at the end of FY 2015.
	Genomic medicine encounters have increased to 2,084 uniques with 2,133 encounters compared to 1,825 uniques and 1,871 encounters in FY 2014.


Telehealth Services and the Office of Rural Health responded to Section 204, the “Mobile Medical Center” portion of the Veterans Choice legislation to ensure that telemedicine capacity is available on all mobile medical units (and mobile Vet Centers).&amp;nbsp; The Telemedicine Assessment subgroup, which became an Integrated Process Team (IPT), completed the survey and summary report in response to the legislation during the fourth quarter.&amp;nbsp; The report defines procedures for activation, management, and operation of mobile medical units.&amp;nbsp; Upon submission of the summary report, the IPT transitioned the project to the Deputy Under Secretary for Operations and Management for maintenance and concluded its activity.&amp;nbsp;

During FY 2015, VHA and the Offices of Information Technology (OIT) provided five Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN) 15 Medical Centers with the capability for live CVT interactive consults with ICU specialists in VISN 23, as well as seven VISN 7 Medical Centers and one VISN 4 Medical Center linked to the VISN 10 Tele-ICU support center.&amp;nbsp; VISN 23 now supports 172 beds at 14 facilities and VISN 10 supports beds 123 and 12 facilities, for a national total of 295 Tele-ICU beds for VHA.&amp;nbsp; The Joint Initiative Funding (JIF) collaboration with Department of Defense includes the installation of five DOD sites and two VISN 15 sites linked to the VISN 23 Tele-ICU support center in the next 24 months.

Telehealth Services has a collaborative agreement and completed the official charter with Special Care Services.&amp;nbsp; The subject matter expert groups have started work on operations manuals, guidance documents, and training for TeleEndocrinology; TeleHematology/Oncology; and TeleInfectious Disease. TelePain and TeleEndorinology are pending charters and identification of SMEs.&amp;nbsp;

Since June 2014, the web-enabled application that permits Veterans to access Home Telehealth (HT) care and case management services from their VA clinical care coordinator using the Veterans own PCs, laptops, and smartphones was released nationally.&amp;nbsp; At the end of FY 2015, there were 3,216 Veterans enrolled across all VISNs.&amp;nbsp;

The Low Intensity/Low Acuity (L2) pilot uses web-enabled technologies for health promotion and disease prevention for stable patients.&amp;nbsp; Enrollment of L2 Veterans began September 1, 2015, with over 123 Veterans enrolled within the first month.&amp;nbsp; In addition, seven new L2 Disease Management Protocols (DMPs) have been developed, and reviewed with the subject matter expert.&amp;nbsp; Two of these, Weight Management and Tobacco Cessation, have been programmed and implemented by the vendor.&amp;nbsp; The remaining five DMPs should be released by end October 2015. Five separate workgroups have completed their projects resulting in the completion of the DMPs, new L2 Documentation Templates were written, installed and in use, new training guidance, a comprehensive outreach marketing toolbox was developed, and a draft L2 Handbook has been composed.&amp;nbsp; Three new work groups have formed to complete the enrollment targets and project timeline, outcome measures, and the pilot evaluation tool.&amp;nbsp; Each site continues to meet with their local L2 Integrated Project in collaboration with Patient Aligned Care Team.&amp;nbsp; The project goal for end FY 2016 is to have at least two Care Coordinators at each site at a panel size of 400 per Care Coordinator for a total of 2,000 patients across the five sites, and a completion of any revisions to the DMPs, templates, and operations manual, as well as a pilot evaluation summary.

Collaboration between Women’s Health and Telehealth has continued and the two services agreed upon the following position.&amp;nbsp; Considering both medical appropriateness, and sensitivity to&amp;nbsp; our patients,&amp;nbsp; CVT may not be optimal if a visit requires a pelvic&amp;nbsp; exam and has the potential need for immediate intervention.&amp;nbsp; It is generally recommended that pelvic exams and colposcopy procedures be completed via an in-person visit with a provider.&amp;nbsp; In a situation where there is a need to perform these exams using telehealth technology, the telepresenter should be a provider proficient in these aspects of the physical exam.&amp;nbsp; In circumstances in which pelvic exams and colposcopy are necessary using telehealth technology, an interim packet with all required documents,&amp;nbsp; including travel distances for in person examination&amp;nbsp; and explanation why this particular location is unable to provide these examinations through a faceto- face visit with a provider&amp;nbsp; must&amp;nbsp; be submitted to Telehealth and Women’s Health Services.&amp;nbsp; No examinations can be performed until interim packets are reviewed and Telehealth and Women’s Health Services provide the authorization for initiation of these services.

The OIT project team completed their review of the technology with regard to expanded use across the VA enterprise and issued a final project analysis paper.&amp;nbsp; Although the summary indicates that OIT infrastructure currently exists to facilitate expanded use, the information technology management system will require improvements and a formal New Project Request will be needed to continue expansion.&amp;nbsp; Also, due to recent funding limitations VA is unable to acquire new tablets for distribution to patients.&amp;nbsp; VHA Telehealth Service has initiated a request to the Denver Acquisition and Logistics Center to form an integrated process team to advance an effort to develop a new competitive solicitation with the intent of engaging additional vendors and ensuring that market forces provide the best cost for the technology.

A memo from the Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Operations and Management was issued in July 2015, and later revised in October, that required all VISNs not yet in active deployment status to complete the Telehealth Scheduling System (TSS) deployment by November 30, 2015.&amp;nbsp; Currently, the total number of systems users has expanded to 13,736.&amp;nbsp; To date, 17,363 telehealth service activities have been scheduled in the system.&amp;nbsp; The two primary tasks currently being addressed are: an upgrade to Microsoft CRM 2015 to address 508 compliance, and integration with VistA, which is dependent on the VA Medical Appointment Scheduling System deployment timeline.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Military service provides Servicemembers with tremendous skills, experience, and honor, but may also result in equally significant sacrifices and challenges. VA will work to ensure Veterans are empowered, independent, self-sustaining, and well equipped for civilian life.
Each Veteran is unique, yet shaped by: their generation; the conditions of their military service, including any war or conflict in which they served; their gender; their ethnicity; and their support system of faith, family, friends, and caregivers. Each has different needs and expectations, which may change many times between the time they take their induction oath and when the last benefit is received by their survivors.
VA will both directly, and in collaboration with its partners, deliver benefits and services in an integrated, client-centered portfolio that is personalized to meet each Veteran’s needs and situation. Success will be measured in terms relevant to individual Veteran outcomes from VA benefits and services.

</objective_statement><objective_overview>Summary:
VA is a customer service organization. Complicated application processes, long processing timelines or difficulties getting information and appointments all impact the client’s experience and satisfaction. Veterans and eligible beneficiaries deserve a support system that is responsive to their needs. VA must keep pace with Veterans’ expectations and transform its customer services – soliciting regular customer feedback, streamlining processes, and delivering consistent service across customer-preferred channels.
We live in a connected world. The rapid pace of technological advancement is reshaping Veterans’ expectations regarding how services, benefits, and support should be delivered. Today’s client expects instant access to information and self-service options via the Internet, and increasingly through mobile devices like tablets and smartphones (and the next generation “smart” devices that are yet to be deployed).
To provide a personalized experience, we must listen, learn, and understand the needs and expectations of those we serve. We must have the knowledge, information and insight to understand why some choose not to fully engage with VA.
Strategies:
VA will provide timely, accurate decisions on Veterans’ disability claims and eliminate the claims backlog. We will then implement a robust plan, and revisit procedures to ensure claims are addressed in no more than 125 days with at least 98 percent accuracy. The plan includes redesigning policies and procedures, continuing to enhance training for claims processors, and utilizing the most advanced IT. We will also increase the use of video teleconference hearings to address claims appeals.
VA will continue to expand implementation of PACT to improve partnerships with Veterans and eligible beneficiaries, increase team-based care coordination and management, and expand access to care. VA will improve patient-facing and clinician-facing e-health systems by expanding the development and use of health-related virtual modalities. These modalities include telehealth[1], E-Consult[2], secure messaging, MyHealtheVet, and mobile applications.
VA will enhance client satisfaction by capturing client data once, sharing it enterprise-wide, and using this client data for a lifetime, which will promote more efficient use of data across business lines. We will identify sources of consistent, reliable, and authoritative Veteran data. We will establish architecture, business rules, roles and responsibilities, and governance to enable VA lines of business to use the authoritative common client data to improve delivery of benefits and services to Veterans. VA will gain access to additional external data, knowledge, and experiences so we can broaden our understanding of our client’s needs and expectations. We will enable secure, privacy-protected electronic exchange of personal, health, and economic data on Veterans from induction oath through the final survivor benefit.
VA will rethink its operations as a Department, defining the fundamental crosscutting capabilities and interdependencies required to perform them. We will identify and address any internal organizational, policy, procedural, perceptual, and cultural boundaries that constrain our ability to coordinate, integrate, and deliver benefits and services.
VA will streamline its virtual presence (Web sites, portals and call centers), reducing duplication and enhancing personalization to enable clients to get the information they need, on their schedule.
VA will increase access to burial benefits in national cemeteries through its plans to construct five new national cemeteries and by recognizing and addressing the unique needs of Veterans and eligible beneficiaries who reside in densely populated urban areas as well as sparsely populated rural locations. We will ensure that the service and appearance of our national cemeteries meets the highest standards commensurate with these national shrines.
 
[1] Telehealth uses information and telecommunication technologies to provide health care services in situations in which the patient and practitioner are separated by geographical distance. Telehealth in VA increases access to high quality health care services using Clinical Video Telehealth (CVT), Home Telehealth (HT) and Store and Forward Telehealth (SFT).
[2] E-Consult is an approach to provide clinical support from provider to provider.  Through a formal consult request, processed and documented in the Computerized Patient Record System, a provider requests a specialist to address a clinical problem or to answer a clinical question for a specific patient.  Utilizing information provided in the consult request and/or review of the patient’s electronic medical record, the consultant provides a documented response that addresses the request without a face-to-face visit.
