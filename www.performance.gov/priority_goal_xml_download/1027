</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>VA will provide timely, accurate decisions on Veterans’ disability compensation and eliminate the claims backlog in Fiscal Year (FY) 2015.&amp;nbsp; Improving quality and reducing the length of time it takes to process disability claims are integral to VA's mission of providing benefits to eligible Veterans in a timely, accurate, and compassionate manner.&amp;nbsp; In FY 2013, VBA began measuring the accuracy of individual issues for each claim (“issue-based accuracy”), as it provides a more detailed measure of workload proficiency.&amp;nbsp; However, VBA will continue to monitor and report out on claim-based accuracy as a key indicator for this Agency Priority Goal.&amp;nbsp; To improve benefits delivery, VA is transitioning to an electronic claims process that will reduce processing time and increase accuracy.&amp;nbsp; As of the end of June 2015, over 94 percent of VBA’s inventory is in an electronic format and is being processed electronically by VBA employees using the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS).&amp;nbsp; All claims are either received electronically or are converted to electronic format for processing.&amp;nbsp;

</next_steps><progress_update>During the fourth quarter of FY 2015, VBA made progress on the execution of its claims transformation plan to change the way benefits and services are delivered to Veterans, their families, and Survivors for generations to come.&amp;nbsp;

From the peak in March 2013 through September 30, 2015, the claims backlog (defined as claims that have been pending over 125 days) was reduced from 611,073 to 71,352 claims, an 88.3-percent decrease.&amp;nbsp;

The total inventory of claims dropped 58.9 percent from the peak of 883,930 in July 2012 to 363,034 on September 30, 2015.&amp;nbsp; During this quarter, the percentage of claims in the backlog decreased from 32.6 end of June 19.7 percent at the end of September 2015.&amp;nbsp; There are specific factors of VA’s claims process and the specific nature of some claims that contribute to extend some claims taking longer than 125 days to process.&amp;nbsp; VA must ensure that VA meets its legal obligations to assist Veterans in the development of their claims and provide their full entitlement to benefits.&amp;nbsp; VA will always consider additional evidence or new medical conditions added throughout the claims process; however, late evidence or new contentions stop the momentum made in processing the claim, as it usually require a new round of evidence-gathering, medical examinations, and analysis.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Additionally, some complex disability claims may require more extensive evidence gathering, or face difficulties securing necessary evidence.&amp;nbsp; Where possible, VA mitigates the impact of extended processing by providing Veterans with an interim rating decision on as many claimed disabilities as possible, while keeping the claim open to develop for the needed evidence to decide all claims.&amp;nbsp; VBA projects that 15 percent of rating claims fall into the category where they cannot be completed in 125 days.&amp;nbsp;

During this quarter, VBA’s three-month claim-based accuracy decreased from 89.8 percent at the end of June 2015 to 89.0 percent at the end of September 2015.&amp;nbsp; Issue-based accuracy increased slightly from 95.9 percent at the end of June 2015 to 96.0 percent at the end of September 2015.&amp;nbsp; Quality continues to be a strong focus area for VBA.&amp;nbsp; Consistent with Government Accountability Office (GAO) best practices for quality assurance programs, VBA uses a 95-percent confidence level with a five-percent margin for error in accuracy reporting.&amp;nbsp; This means that the accuracy of VBA disability rating claims has not substantially changed in the past quarter.&amp;nbsp; VBA continues to monitor errors and trends to provide feedback and training for VA employees.

As we have made major progress in reducing the claims backlog, we have also dramatically increased the accuracy of our claim decisions.&amp;nbsp; VA’s aspirational 98 percent accuracy goal for disability claims was initially reflected in the 2005 President’s Budget as a method to drive VBA’s decision quality as high as possible – and VA has done that with monumental progress over the past 4 years.&amp;nbsp; In fact, VA is now correct 98 percent of the time in seven of the eight categories measured within a Veteran’s disability claim, with the eighth factor coming in at 97.7 percent.&amp;nbsp;

A recently contracted external analysis found that VA’s 98 percent claim-level accuracy goal is not considered to be achievable in VA’s current human-operated system.&amp;nbsp; Claim-level accuracy measures the claim with the “pass or fail” method.&amp;nbsp; Every issue within each of the eight error categories must be 100-percent accurate to “pass”.&amp;nbsp; Because Veterans are claiming more disabilities than ever before – with separating Servicemembers in our Benefits Delivery at Discharge Program averaging 16 medical conditions per claim – attaining 98 percent accuracy at the claim-level is virtually impossible.

Each quarter, VBMS releases new features and functionalities, allowing the system to evolve to meet the needs of the organization and claim processers.&amp;nbsp; As major software releases are implemented, VBMS progresses toward the future end-state of a complete, end-to-end electronic claims processing system.&amp;nbsp; This quarter, VBMS focused on enhancements within the work queue, the new deferral process, and auto assignment configuration rules in support of National Work Queue rollout in FY 2016.&amp;nbsp; At the end of this quarter, 94.1 percent of the claims inventory for rating end products was in digital format for electronic processing.&amp;nbsp; Paper claims received by VBA are immediately sent for scanning and digitally uploaded to VBMS.&amp;nbsp; As of the end of the FY 2015, more than 1.77 billion images have been scanned through the Veterans Claims Intake Program with 99-percent image accuracy.&amp;nbsp; Scanning provides a front-end catalyst that facilitates shared access to the claims folder and eliminates transfer time delays throughout the claims process.

Due to VBA’s extensive outreach efforts, more Veterans are using an electronic intake method – the joint Department of Defense (DoD)/VA web portal eBenefits – to submit claims electronically.&amp;nbsp; In FY 2013, 2.4 percent of Veterans’ claims (20,035) were received electronically; in FY 2015, 12.5 percent (154,398) of claims were received electronically.&amp;nbsp; As of September 30, 2015, there are 5.1 million registered eBenefits users with access to benefits information and the capability to submit claims and upload evidence online through electronic claims submission that will feed directly into VBMS.&amp;nbsp; Registered eBenefits users with a free premium-level account can also track the status of their claims and access a variety of other benefit information including pension, education, health care, home loan eligibility, and vocational rehabilitation and employment.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, the Stakeholder Enterprise Portal (SEP), an electronic web portal that mirrors eBenefits, allows VA partners and Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs) to electronically file
claims for benefits and services on behalf of Veterans for whom they have power of attorney.&amp;nbsp;

VBA continues to work closely with Congressional and VSO partners to promote VBA’s FDC Program, which reduces the longest phase of the claims-processing timeline by allowing Veterans to certify that they have submitted their claims with all available supporting information and non-Federal private medical evidence.&amp;nbsp; Many Veterans are submitting their claims as FDCs, and more continue to do so thanks in large part to strong support and endorsement by our VSO partners.&amp;nbsp; From July 1, 2015, through September 30, 2015, approximately 62.6 percent of claims received were submitted as FDCs.&amp;nbsp; Veterans filing their initial disability compensation claim as an FDC through August 5, 2015 may be eligible for up to one year of retroactive benefits.

None of the progress VBA has made would be possible without the tremendous support VA receives from its partners including Congress, VSO partners, and county and state Departments of Veterans Affairs.&amp;nbsp; VBA’s progress is also the result of unprecedented effort and dedication by the 21,000+ VBA employees (of which over 50 percent are Veterans themselves), and the support provided by our partners in VA’s Office of Information and Technology and the Veterans Health Administration.&amp;nbsp;

As a direct result of the claims transformation initiatives VBA has implemented over the last three years, VBA is deciding more disability compensation rating claims for Veterans at higher accuracy levels than ever before in the history of VBA.&amp;nbsp; But there is still more work to do.&amp;nbsp; The groundwork laid thus far will help VBA continue to transform the way benefits are delivered to Veterans, their family members, and Survivors for generations to come.&amp;nbsp; As VBA moves into advanced generations of VBMS, it is improving access, driving automation, enabling greater exchange of information, and increasing transparency to Veterans, our workforce, and other stakeholders.&amp;nbsp;

Valuable tools, such as automated disability benefits questionnaires and an embedded rules engine, inject much-needed efficiency and effectiveness into VBA’s system.&amp;nbsp; This helps VBA meet today’s demand while also preparing it to meet the demands of the future.&amp;nbsp; VBMS uses an iterative and agile development model in which software development is broken down into smaller components to design, test, and release new functionality.&amp;nbsp; Progressive software releases will continue building out these automated capabilities, allowing employees to focus on more difficult claims by automating more routine processes.&amp;nbsp; With the transition to a paperless claims process, VBA is in a better position to adopt a national workload management strategy within VBMS that is “boundary-free” and improves overall production capacity to serve Veterans in the same way they served: side by side without regard to state affiliation.&amp;nbsp; With VBMS, VBA can more efficiently manage the claims workload, prioritizing and distributing the claims electronically across its network of regional offices (ROs) to improve resource utilization and improve and normalize processing timeliness.&amp;nbsp;

VBA will continue to drive and incentivize claims filing through eBenefits and SEP, especially the filing of electronic FDCs.&amp;nbsp; VBA is continuing its comprehensive communications and training efforts to increase Veterans’ and stakeholders’ awareness of the ability to file claims online.&amp;nbsp; As VBA continues to refine these technologies, it is also improving its customer relationship management program by increasing integration across VA systems by providing a single view of Veterans’ information, benefits utilization, and interactions across VA.&amp;nbsp; With data from many separate systems available in a single place, VA will have a comprehensive view of each Veteran from his or her service commencement date onward.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Military service provides Servicemembers with tremendous skills, experience, and honor, but may also result in equally significant sacrifices and challenges. VA will work to ensure Veterans are empowered, independent, self-sustaining, and well equipped for civilian life.
Each Veteran is unique, yet shaped by: their generation; the conditions of their military service, including any war or conflict in which they served; their gender; their ethnicity; and their support system of faith, family, friends, and caregivers. Each has different needs and expectations, which may change many times between the time they take their induction oath and when the last benefit is received by their survivors.
VA will both directly, and in collaboration with its partners, deliver benefits and services in an integrated, client-centered portfolio that is personalized to meet each Veteran’s needs and situation. Success will be measured in terms relevant to individual Veteran outcomes from VA benefits and services.

</objective_statement><objective_overview>Summary:
VA is a customer service organization. Complicated application processes, long processing timelines or difficulties getting information and appointments all impact the client’s experience and satisfaction. Veterans and eligible beneficiaries deserve a support system that is responsive to their needs. VA must keep pace with Veterans’ expectations and transform its customer services – soliciting regular customer feedback, streamlining processes, and delivering consistent service across customer-preferred channels.
We live in a connected world. The rapid pace of technological advancement is reshaping Veterans’ expectations regarding how services, benefits, and support should be delivered. Today’s client expects instant access to information and self-service options via the Internet, and increasingly through mobile devices like tablets and smartphones (and the next generation “smart” devices that are yet to be deployed).
To provide a personalized experience, we must listen, learn, and understand the needs and expectations of those we serve. We must have the knowledge, information and insight to understand why some choose not to fully engage with VA.
Strategies:
VA will provide timely, accurate decisions on Veterans’ disability claims and eliminate the claims backlog. We will then implement a robust plan, and revisit procedures to ensure claims are addressed in no more than 125 days with at least 98 percent accuracy. The plan includes redesigning policies and procedures, continuing to enhance training for claims processors, and utilizing the most advanced IT. We will also increase the use of video teleconference hearings to address claims appeals.
VA will continue to expand implementation of PACT to improve partnerships with Veterans and eligible beneficiaries, increase team-based care coordination and management, and expand access to care. VA will improve patient-facing and clinician-facing e-health systems by expanding the development and use of health-related virtual modalities. These modalities include telehealth[1], E-Consult[2], secure messaging, MyHealtheVet, and mobile applications.
VA will enhance client satisfaction by capturing client data once, sharing it enterprise-wide, and using this client data for a lifetime, which will promote more efficient use of data across business lines. We will identify sources of consistent, reliable, and authoritative Veteran data. We will establish architecture, business rules, roles and responsibilities, and governance to enable VA lines of business to use the authoritative common client data to improve delivery of benefits and services to Veterans. VA will gain access to additional external data, knowledge, and experiences so we can broaden our understanding of our client’s needs and expectations. We will enable secure, privacy-protected electronic exchange of personal, health, and economic data on Veterans from induction oath through the final survivor benefit.
VA will rethink its operations as a Department, defining the fundamental crosscutting capabilities and interdependencies required to perform them. We will identify and address any internal organizational, policy, procedural, perceptual, and cultural boundaries that constrain our ability to coordinate, integrate, and deliver benefits and services.
VA will streamline its virtual presence (Web sites, portals and call centers), reducing duplication and enhancing personalization to enable clients to get the information they need, on their schedule.
VA will increase access to burial benefits in national cemeteries through its plans to construct five new national cemeteries and by recognizing and addressing the unique needs of Veterans and eligible beneficiaries who reside in densely populated urban areas as well as sparsely populated rural locations. We will ensure that the service and appearance of our national cemeteries meets the highest standards commensurate with these national shrines.
 
[1] Telehealth uses information and telecommunication technologies to provide health care services in situations in which the patient and practitioner are separated by geographical distance. Telehealth in VA increases access to high quality health care services using Clinical Video Telehealth (CVT), Home Telehealth (HT) and Store and Forward Telehealth (SFT).
[2] E-Consult is an approach to provide clinical support from provider to provider.  Through a formal consult request, processed and documented in the Computerized Patient Record System, a provider requests a specialist to address a clinical problem or to answer a clinical question for a specific patient.  Utilizing information provided in the consult request and/or review of the patient’s electronic medical record, the consultant provides a documented response that addresses the request without a face-to-face visit.
