In FYs 2014 and 2015, we will increase the number of online transactions by 10 percent over each respective prior fiscal year. This equates to 77.8 million online transactions in FY 2015.
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Online services are vital to good public service. The Internet provides the public with the ability to conduct Social Security business at their convenience and at their own pace, without the need to travel to a field office or wait to meet with one of our representatives. In addition to being convenient, increased use of online services benefits the public and SSA by reducing the average time our employees spend processing claims, freeing them to handle workloads that are more complicated.

Over the last few years, we implemented several new, secure and easy-to-use online services, which allow us to handle the surge of benefit applications better. Our goal is to continue increasing the variety of online services we offer, including the ability to apply for a range of benefits, access information instantly, and update records. We are committed to making our online services secure and easy to use. In FY 2013, customers submitted more than 2.5 million retirement and disability applications online, an 80 percent increase over FY 2009, when customers submitted 1.4 million claims online.

Developing online services for a population with a variety of experiences and comfort levels with technology presents a unique challenge. We solicit stakeholder input using a variety of methods prior to developing our services. Usability testing, focus groups, and advocacy discussions are common tools we use to engage our external stakeholders. We also consult with our employees when developing online services. Once we implement new online services, we continue to engage the public by soliciting their feedback using the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI). Federal and private sectors use ACSI surveys to measure public satisfaction with various website features. In addition to the ACSI feedback, we also use internal survey mechanisms to improve our online services. These tools provide us with standard, statistical measurements of public satisfaction, and we use this information to guide decision-making for future improvements.

In FYs 2014 and 2015, we increased the number of online transactions by 10 percent over each respective prior fiscal year.&amp;nbsp; Our FY 2014 goal was to conduct 50.7 million transactions. FY 2014 data indicated that customers filed 52.7% of claims online.


Our FY 2015 goal was to complete 77.8 million online transactions (10% over FY 2014). We exceeded our FY 2015 goal by completing over 87 million online transactions, a 23% increase over FY 2014. In the 4th quarter of FY 2015, our customers processed 21,175,429 online transactions. FY 2015 data indicated that customers filed 54.1% of claims online.

Much our success is due to the following efforts:


	Availability of enhanced services behind my Social Security – We implemented Customer Engagement Tools for the my Social Security portal during the 4th quarter of FY 2015. These enhancements allow customer support through a convenient channel and, contributed to an increasing number&amp;nbsp;of new&amp;nbsp;my Social Security accounts. Additionally, we migrated and enhanced several existing services to my Social Security, and implemented several new ones. We enhanced the customers’ ability to request a 1099 from the agency. Under this application, customers can request a replacement 1099 and receive one in the mail within 10 days.
	External partners – We continued to collaborate with external partners on the SSA Express Desktop Icon project. Our new Icon partners include hospitals, libraries, the Department of Health and Human Services, and job training centers.
	Marketing efforts – We placed more emphasis on campaign elements that most efficiently increase online transactions. These included Search Engine Marketing (SEM), email blasts, pre-roll video promoting Retire Online, and paid Facebook ads and videos. As a result, we were able to drive more people to &quot;Apply for Retirement&quot; and &quot;Create an Account&quot; online, increase audience engagement via email messaging and videos, and expand our visibility with page post ads and videos on Facebook.&amp;nbsp; We also created a marketing strategy to promote a new feature that will allow customers to get help online while using their my Social Security accounts, through automated answers to questions, or by requesting a call back from a Social Security representative.


FY 2015 Quarterly Milestones Progress to date:

•&amp;nbsp;Q1 Milestone – In order to increase the number of online transactions, we will increase the number of services available to the public, such as the ability to request a replacement Social Security Card via my Social Security.


	We completed approximately 90% of the iSSNRC (internet Social Security Number Replacement Card) planning &amp;amp; analysis activities and expect to complete the following activities in the 2nd Quarter of FY 15:



	&amp;nbsp;Signoff of the Project Scope Agreement (PSA);
	&amp;nbsp;Completion of the Screen Package; and
	&amp;nbsp;Complete Requirement gathering and begin development.


•&amp;nbsp;Q2 Milestone – In order to promote direct access to online services within SSA and across all federal agencies, we will evaluate aspects of the Federal Cloud Credential Exchange (FCCX) and, as appropriate, develop a plan for implementation.


	FCCX was renamed “connect.gov” in December 2014, with the connect.gov going live shortly after. At the end of this quarter, two credential service providers were available on the website – Verizon and ID.me. The initial implementations are proceeding, with General Services Administration (GSA), United States Postal Service (USPS), and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as the initial implementing agencies. SSA continues to participate in scheduled meetings.
	We have initiated a Strategic Information Technology Assessment and Review (SITAR) project template for planning and analysis on implementing Executive Order 13681.&amp;nbsp; While we cannot complete planning and analysis or an implementation plan without pending Administration guidance and subsequent analysis, we are able to explore options for a significant known requirement – two-factor authentication.


•&amp;nbsp;Q3 Milestone – We have implemented enhancements to the my Social Security portal, In order to increase the number of online transactions and to motivate current customers to stay within the self-service channel:


	&amp;nbsp;Medicare Replacement Card project,
	&amp;nbsp;Downloadable SSA Statement, and
	&amp;nbsp;Customer Engagement Tools (CET), specifically the Click-to-Callback feature.



•&amp;nbsp;Q4 Milestone – We surveyed customers using customer satisfaction surveys (CSS) in order to improve their experience and increase interest in future services.


	Currently, our customer satisfaction rating is at 95%. We collected 109 CSS customer satisfaction surveys during the 4th quarter of FY 2015, which brought us to 404 surveys received from customers.

Our goal is to achieve even greater success in customer service and satisfaction through innovative online self-service options.  Each year, we see greater acceptance of technology across all demographic segments and a stronger preference for doing business online.  In particular, Internet use by seniors continues to rise.  To capitalize on this trend, we will increase the number of services we offer online and will communicate more with our customers online.
Because of the complexities of the programs we administer, we will provide customer support for our online services for times when customers need advice or assistance.  In keeping with the Administration’s one-government approach, we will partner with other agencies and community organizations to offer access to more government services online through increasing use of video servcies and the implementation of Social Security Express to provide servive using self-service kiosks.
We will continue to adjust our physical office structure to reflect our online service emphasis.  However, we will remain mindful of the importance of continuing to provide in-person service for those customers whose business with us requires it.  Technology will not replace employees.  Instead, it will free them to handle the more complex workloads and the individuals who require in-person help.  It will also give our employees tools to help them handle increasingly varied and complex work.
