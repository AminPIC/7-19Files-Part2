</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Social Security pays disability benefits to people who cannot work because they have a medical condition expected to last at least one year or result in death.&amp;nbsp; When we receive a claim for disability benefits, we consider all the information concerning a case before we make an eligibility decision.&amp;nbsp; When we make a decision, we send a letter explaining our decision. If you do not agree with our decision, you can appeal, asking us to look at your case again.&amp;nbsp; The reconsideration is the first level of our appeals process and involves a complete review of the claim by someone who did not take part in the original decision.&amp;nbsp; If you disagree with the reconsideration decision, you may ask for a hearing. An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) who had no part in the original decision or the reconsideration of the case conducts a hearing.&amp;nbsp; Though the vast majority of hearings held are disability related, ALJs also hold hearings for non-disability related issues such as retirement.

We hold hearings either in-person at one of our 169 hearings offices or by using video teleconferencing equipment at many more locations.&amp;nbsp; Those locations include:


	Other hearing offices;
	Permanent remote sites, which are leased spaces, usually in government buildings, in parts of the country some distance from hearing offices with large geographical service areas;
	Claimant-only video sites, which are typically located in Social Security field offices some distance from hearing offices with large geographical service areas;and
	Our National Hearing Centers (NHC), which are special hearing offices located around the country where we hold only video hearings.


As part of our Representative Video Project, claimants may also attend a hearing at their representative’s office if that representative owns and uses video equipment approved by Social Security.

A video hearing allows hearing participants to see and hear each other through large color television screens or desktop video units.&amp;nbsp; The ALJ remains in the hearing office.&amp;nbsp; The ALJ can see and speak with all hearing participants and vice versa through Social Security’s secure network.&amp;nbsp; As with in-person hearings, we only record audio at video hearings.

The greatest benefit of video is that it allows us to assist offices that have more work than they can complete.&amp;nbsp; Being able to move work from an office that has a significant backlog to one that does not helps us provide effective service to all claimants.&amp;nbsp; The economic downturn did not affect all of our hearing offices equally.&amp;nbsp; Due to regional differences in the economy, some hearing offices saw their workloads soar while others did not.&amp;nbsp; Rather than only build new offices in our hardest-hit areas, and hiring and moving staff at great expense, Social Security’s response was to leverage our developing video hearing technology.&amp;nbsp; Because of video, we can electronically move the work to an ALJ ready to hear and decide the case.

Though we had been using video on a very limited basis since FY 2005, our breakthrough came with the introduction of the NHCs, which hold only video hearings and can therefore provide relief to any hearing office throughout the country.&amp;nbsp; Beginning in FY 2008, we began opening this new kind of office.

We also accelerated the placement of video units in hearing offices.&amp;nbsp; Between FY 2008 and FY 2013, we placed 1,032 video units in the hearing operation, with more than 960 of those going to traditional hearing offices.&amp;nbsp; This aggressive expansion allowed hearing offices to provide assistance to one another and to hold hearings in far-flung permanent remote sites within a hearing office’s own service area.&amp;nbsp; In this way, offices in California and Florida can assist offices in the Midwest and vice-versa, depending on the changing needs of our offices.&amp;nbsp; In FY 2013, traditional hearing offices held approximately 23 percent of all hearings by video.

We have incrementally increased the percentage of hearings we hold by video from 20 percent in FY 2010 and FY 2011, to 23 percent in FY 2012 and now to 26 percent (179,308 hearings) in FY 2013.&amp;nbsp; Much of this growth came from increasing our video footprint, achieved by equipping more and more of our hearing offices and remote hearing sites with video equipment each successive year. &amp;nbsp;We are aiming to hold 28 percent of hearings by video in FY 2014 and 30 percent in FY 2015.

Though we are nearing the saturation point for video equipment placement, we believe further video hearing expansion is possible, and that we can still greatly improve customer service. We can hold more video hearings by improving the quality, marketing, and deployment of video units and by publishing a final regulation that puts time limits on a claimant’s right to decline a video hearing.

Further expansion of video hearings positions Social Security for maximum flexibility in responding to changing customer needs.&amp;nbsp; Video lets us electronically move work rather than build “brick and mortar” offices whose useful lifespan may be limited.

&amp;nbsp;
</next_steps><progress_update>Through the end of September,&amp;nbsp;we held 152,880 video hearings, or 27.11% out of a total of 563,893 hearings. The goal was 30% for FY 2015.&amp;nbsp;We completed studies of lighting and layout requirements of video hearings rooms and received funding to retrofit hearing sites with the new lighting requirements. Thirty pilot sites were planned to be retrofitted by the end of FY 2015. Of these 30 pilot locations, 21 locations have been awarded with a ‘Notice to Proceed’, and 9 are still pending.&amp;nbsp;We continue to monitor the effect of the&amp;nbsp;opt-out regulation on the percentage of video hearings held. For the period September 2014 through September 2015, 29% of claimants declined video hearings

FY 2015 Milestone Updates

Q1 Milestone – Experiment with our model hearing room and claimant-only video rooms to study how different factors (e.g. lighting, acoustics, room layouts, furniture) affect video quality. Use the results to make adjustments that will improve video quality.


	We completed studies of lighting and layout requirements of video hearing rooms and received funding to retrofit hearing sites with the new lighting requirements. While no hearing sites were retrofitted by the end of the first quarter, 31 pilot sites are planned to be retrofitted by the end of FY 2015. Based on stakeholder input, we will collaborate with the Office of Operations on strategies to address issues with certain hearing sites that are located in field and regional facilities.


Q2 Milestone – Improve our video footprint nationally by examining geographic video coverage.&amp;nbsp; Determine if video coverage is adequate for all states and regions and redeploy units as necessary to maximize national video footprint.


	We upgraded our video infrastructure with new software allowing easier troubleshooting and by increasing the video units on the SSA network.&amp;nbsp; We are also building model-hearing sites configured so that hearing participants can better see and hear each other.&amp;nbsp; We requested supplemental IT funding ($3 million) for additional video equipment for claimant only video (COV) sites and judge only video (JOV) sites in support of our video infrastructure. As a result of these initiatives, we have increased the agency’s geographic video hearing coverage.


Q3 Milestone – Assess the impact of the “Changes to Scheduling and Appearing at Hearings” regulation.&amp;nbsp; Consider regulatory or procedural changes if the regulation results in an excessive number of video declinations.


	We established tracking report on national level video “opt outs” (declinations).&amp;nbsp; For the period September 2014 through January 2015, 28% of claimants declined video hearings.


Q4 Milestone–Improve the quality of video hearings by completing&amp;nbsp; the replacement of all rear projection video units.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;


	&amp;nbsp;We have replaced the remaining 262 rear projection units (i.e., “ViewStations”) and&amp;nbsp;deployed all planned units. The replacements and additions will improve the overall quality of the video transmission. We received supplemental IT funding ($3 million) for additional video equipment for claimant only video (COV) sites and judge only video (JOV) sites in support of our video infrastructure. We are also working with the Office of Systems on a Global Video Service Delivery Strategy to further improve the infrastructure and quality of video hearings.


Next Steps:
Video Hearings is a secondary indicator for our FY 2016-2017 Hearings Pending Agency Priority Goal.

From FY 2007 to 2013, the number of disability claims we received increased from 2.5 million to nearly 3 million.  This increase equates to a growth of about 20 percent in initial disability claims.  Appeals for hearings before Administrative Law Judges (ALJ) have also increased by 40 percent over the same period.
Going forward, we will work to deliver a stronger, more responsive program to our disability claimants and beneficiaries. Specifically, we will focus on improving the consistency and quality of our claims process. We will expand our use of management information (MI) to help target services needing improvement, strengthen policy development, and expedite decisions.Based on our improved understanding of this MI, we will be able to give better feedback to our adjudicators and enable them to improve the accuracy of their decision-making.
We will maximize efficiencies throughout the disability program by leveraging technology.Our efforts will include expanding our use of health IT.We plan to increase the volume of medical evidence received through health IT by increasing our partnerships with medical networks and providers.Our heath IT initiatives will reduce the wait time for receiving medical evidence and reduce the time to adjudicate claims. One of our key initiatives is to increase the use of video hearings to help expedite disability decisions.This service provides convenience to the applicant as well as savings to the American taxpayer.
We also are pursuing a national initiative to bring greater consistency to the many disparate systems that support our State disability determination services (DDS). Our Disability Case Processing System (DCPS) will allow us to systematically support policy changes faster and make it easier to modify our case processing system nationally.DCPS also will allow us to share work across disability components more easily.
Because part of our goal is to encourage individuals receiving disability benefits to return to work if they are able to do so, we are developing strategies to increase opportunities for beneficiaries to work and be self-sufficient.  We are taking steps to create clear and consistent employment incentives, and review our disability data to identify new strategies to increase the number of disability beneficiaries who return to work.

We are using a new analytical tool that provides many of our ALJs and support staff with MI on their work relative to the rest of their office, their region, and the Nation.  The information we gain from this analysis will help us to improve the way we review and decide disability cases, making our process simpler and more efficient.
We will continue our partnerships with other agencies to further modernize key aspects of our disability process.  These include our partnership with the National Academy of Science’s Institute of Medicine to revise our disability guidelines to reflect the most up-to-date medical knowledge; our collaboration with the Department of Labor to update our occupational information; and our partnership with the research community, for example the Disability Research Consortium, to refine our policy development.
We will also expand the use of technology to improve quality and consistency.  A few years ago, we implemented the electronic Claims Analysis Tool (eCAT) which assists disability examiners in documenting initial decisions to ensure compliance with agency policy.  We plan to expand eCAT to process CDRs.  Based on the success of eCAT, we used a similar approach to build a tool we can use at the appeals level.  We will eventually extend eCAT to our field offices, resulting in our agency having one tool to assist in ensuring proper documentation and compliance with agency policy throughout the entire disability process.
Expanding the use of video hearings – one of our key initiatives – will help increase efficiency and improve customer service.  Specifically, it will enable us to balance workloads across the country, reduce the need for (and the costs of) our ALJs and other hearing office staff to travel between offices and to remote sites to hold hearings, and reduce the need for claimants to travel long distances to hearing offices.  We also are working to expand video hearing participation more broadly to allow more attorneys and non-attorney representatives to install and use their own video equipment to attend hearings from their own offices.
Strategies: 
Expand use of MI to identify training needs and areas for improvement;
Broaden use of case analysis tools;
Expand use of predictive modeling;
Simplify policies;
Collaborate with the Bureau of Labor Statistics to collect updated occupational information; and
Formalize our pre-decisional quality review processes to increase national uniformity.
