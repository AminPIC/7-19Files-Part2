</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>The priority goal is directly tied to the objective of both the National Export Initiative (NEI) and the Export Promotion Cabinet (EPC) to expand SME access to trade financing, which has been identified as a gap issue for smaller exporters.&amp;nbsp; Increasing access to export financing, combined with trade counseling and training, will contribute to the enhanced ability of current and future U.S. small business exporters to succeed in the global marketplace and supports the cross-agency goal of doubling U.S. exports.

&amp;nbsp;There are barriers and challenges to the SBA in achieving its priority goals:


	From a marketing perspective, communicating and disseminating trade financing information to lenders and small business exporters could provide challenging given current, and anticipated, budget constraints on staffing.



	Inter-agency collaboration and joint initiatives can be challenging to manage, given the differing regulations and performance metrics of individual agencies, which might reduce the commitment of other agencies to help support this priority.



	Unique, and sometimes additional, Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) requirements for core export loans vs. other 7(a) loan products can confuse lenders and may require the creation of “Lender Training Manuals,” more extensive lender training, and Office of Capital Access support in implementing needed SOP revisions.



	In terms of operations, a reduced travel budget could greatly restrict the ability of field staff to deliver the necessary training to lenders and businesses that would expand the use of SBA loan programs for exporters, given that SBA's specialized trade finance specialists cover multiple states.



	The banking sector could receive another “financial shock,” forcing it to tighten lending requirements to small businesses and/or Basel III capital requirements could limit lending capacity.*



	&amp;nbsp;U.S. export growth could slow, reducing demand for trade financing, as a result of slow overseas economic growth and/or a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, making U.S. exports less competitive.


&amp;nbsp;

Trade financing historically has been perceived by many lenders, especially community banks, as being too complex to be incorporated into their suite of financial products. Working with other federal agencies, SBA will help reduce the complexity of USG trade financing and export marketing programs and highlight the growing importance of exports to the U.S. economy, thereby encouraging more lenders to offer comprehensive business solutions to their export customers.&amp;nbsp; In addition, SBA will leverage its outreach by working with state, federal, and other resource partners in order to promote customized trade financing options to the small business exporting community.

In FY 2015, the SBA continued to target new lenders to support small business exporters in their communities by hosting the 8th Annual SBA Export Lenders Roundtable in Washington, D.C. and the 2nd Annual West Coast SBA Export Lenders Roundtable in Los Angeles, and by providing a webinar for members of the National Association of Credit Unions, as well as other outreach and training events with national and state lender associations. During the same period, the SBA provided consultation services to&amp;nbsp;3,938 lenders and trained 4,329 lenders on SBA export loan guaranty programs.&amp;nbsp; SBA also provided consultation services to&amp;nbsp;4,515 small businesses and trained&amp;nbsp;8,120 small businesses on export finance.&amp;nbsp; These initiatives supported SBA’s progress toward its FY 2014-2015 Agency Priority Goal and helped the Agency to enlist 514 lenders to provide financing to 1,513 small business exporters.&amp;nbsp;

Performance results were affected&amp;nbsp;by staffing shortages in the field during the year. &amp;nbsp;Fifteen percent of field trade finance positions were vacant for almost 9 months, impacting SBA's ablility to increase the number of lenders active in supporting small business exporters with SBA finacing. &amp;nbsp;Also, the total number of active lenders is decreasing across the county each year due to bank consolidation, which means that there are few lenders to make exports loans. &amp;nbsp;The SBA exceeded its target for small businesses receiving export financing despite only meeting 93% of its target for lenders providing export financing solutions.&amp;nbsp; While staffing continues to be a challenge in terms of meeting the Congressional mandate of having 30 export finance specialists in the field, the SBA was able to hire new export finance specialists to fill key vacancies in the U.S. Export Assistance Centers to promote exports and SBA’s export financing programs.&amp;nbsp;

The SBA continued to use its small business counselor training certification program in partnership with the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee.&amp;nbsp; The certification program includes an extensive training track on international trade, which the SBA offers at the annual Association of Small Business Development Centers conference and a training and certification website (export.gov/sbcounselors).&amp;nbsp; In September 2011, fewer than 100 small business development center counselors had been certified in international trade counseling.&amp;nbsp; Now more than 600 international trade-certified counselors within the SBDC network have credentials to provide training.

The SBA also partnered with the U.S. Department of Commerce to provide trade financing experts at domestic and overseas trade shows to counsel U.S. small business exhibitors about various financing options.&amp;nbsp; International trade shows take the U.S. exhibitors to foreign locations where they need to conduct business.&amp;nbsp; Having trade finance expertise “on the ground” supports businesses at events where U.S. exhibitors meet to negotiate sales terms with foreign buyers who attend these shows.&amp;nbsp; SBA export finance specialists provided counseling and training at 19 of the Department of Commerce International Buyer program (IBP) industrial shows and three international trade shows.&amp;nbsp; At IBP events, small business exporters meet pre-screened prospective buyers from around the world in one domestic venue.
</progress_update><themes><theme>Commerce and Housing Credit</theme></themes><contributing_programs_and_other_factors>The Office of International Trade’s U.S. Export Assistance Centers (USEACs) and the Office of Field Operations’ District Offices (District International Trade Officers and Lender Relations Specialists) will provide export training, counseling, and financing to both small businesses and to lenders seeking to enhance their lending portfolio by providing SBA financing solutions that meet the needs of small business exporters. In addition, the Office of Entrepreneurial Development and the Office of Capital Access will provide support, respectively, for leveraging outreach and training efforts and for delivering the export loan programs.

SBA will work closely with the Export-Import Bank on the introduction and expansion of a new multi-agency initiative to combine trade finance programs into a one-stop platform: U.S. Global Business Solutions (USGBS). Additional partners in this initiative include the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commercial Service), U.S. Department of Agriculture (Foreign Agriculture Services), U.S. Trade and Development Agency, and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. These federal partners will work in concert to demystify export finance for lenders, especially smaller community banks.

In addition, resource partners and multiplier groups, such as Small Business Development Centers, Manufacturing Extension Partnership offices, Minority Business Development Agency business centers, and state trade offices, will be trained on this “whole-of-government” approach to providing trade financing to small business exporters in order to leverage outreach to the business community.
