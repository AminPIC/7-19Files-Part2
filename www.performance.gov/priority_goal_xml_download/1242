&amp;nbsp;
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>The James Webb Space Telescope (Webb) Program will produce an astronomical observatory capable of watching the universe light up after the Big Bang. It will revolutionize humankind's understanding of the Cosmos and our place in it.&amp;nbsp; This observatory is key for meeting NASA's strategic objective to discover how the universe works, explore how it began and evolved, and search for life on planets around other stars. Webb is NASA's new telescope that will allow us to explore deeper into space and see things that even the Hubble Space Telescope cannot see. Webb's new technologies, like those developed for the backplane components, are critical to the mission's success.

The Webb observatory has a deployable, segmented primary mirror made up of 18 hexagonal mirrors. When combined into a single structure, these computer-controlled mirrors will form a single crisp image.&amp;nbsp; To form these sharp images, the mirror segments must be firmly held by an extremely rigid and stable structure known as the primary mirror backplane.&amp;nbsp; This backplane can be thought of as a skeleton on which we hang the mirror segments. The backplane support structure attaches to the primary mirror backplane and holds the science instrument module.&amp;nbsp; The science instrument module contains the observatory's cameras and spectrographs.&amp;nbsp; The backplane support structure provides a rigid and thermally stable platform to guarantee that the science instruments and telescope mirror stay in perfect alignment.

The construction of the primary mirror backplane and backplane support structure is the pacing item in the schedule for the telescope.&amp;nbsp; Keeping these items on schedule is vital to keeping Webb on track for its planned October 2018 launch.&amp;nbsp; From now through FY 2015, the parts of the backplane (center section, wings, backplane support fixture, and test equipment) will undergo their final phases of manufacturing and testing before being assembled into a single unit.&amp;nbsp; This single unit will be delivered to the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD.&amp;nbsp; Once the completed unit is available, NASA will place the 18 mirror segments into the backplane.&amp;nbsp;

Following the completion of the telescope, the Webb program will embark on the next major integration and test portion of its schedule.&amp;nbsp; In 2016, the program will begin the integration of the telescope with the science instrument module (denoted as Optical Telescope plus Integrated Science instrument module: OTIS).&amp;nbsp; Also in 2016, the spacecraft will begin its integration steps.&amp;nbsp; In 2017, NASA will complete the OTIS testing.&amp;nbsp; The spacecraft and sunshield will be integrated and tested in 2017.&amp;nbsp; Finally, in 2018, the complete integration of the observatory will occur, joining the OTIS and the spacecraft in preparation for their launch in October.

Along the way toward this critical milestone, NASA completed all of its intermediate (quarterly) goals on or ahead of schedule. Below are some of the highlights from these quarterly goals, as well as select others.

In early 2014, Webb completed its spacecraft Critical Design Review. This review was the final major design review for the program, and demonstrated that the design of the spacecraft element (spacecraft bus and sunshield) was mature enough to proceed to production.

As it made progress toward delivering the flight backplane, the Webb program completed the Pathfinder Telescope (or “Pathfinder”), comprised of a flight-like telescope center section, two mirror segments and a secondary mirror. That Pathfinder has subsequently undergone two successful cryovacuum tests at the Johnson Space Center and has provided important lessons for when the flight telescope and science instruments are tested there.

The science instruments have undergone a second cryovacuum test at the Goddard Space Flight Center. Several hardware elements (including the heat straps and sensor chips for one of the instruments) were found to be operating suboptimally and replaced after the test. Uncovering issues is precisely the point of hardware testing. The science instruments with updated hardware are now undergoing their third and final cryovacuum test before being mated to the telescope. Program reserves and funded schedule reserve are held in order to keep the total program within its appropriated budget and on track for the October 2018 launch. Webb is still well within its cost and schedule reserves to meet its planned launch date.

A particularly challenging technical element of the mission, a cryocooler for one of the science instruments, presented the program with problems during the performance period. Webb was able to absorb the cost and schedule impacts of the cryocooler. These manufacturing problems have been overcome, and the flight system is now undergoing acceptance testing and is performing well.

The Webb Program continues to be an agency priority goal for the FY 2016-FY 2017 reporting cycle. Over this period, NASA plans to complete science instrument testing, populate the telescope structure with mirrors, join the instruments and telescope together, and deliver the combination for testing prior to joining them with the spacecraft.
</progress_update><themes><theme>General Science, Space, and Technology</theme></themes><contributing_programs_and_other_factors>Within NASA, the James Webb Space Telescope (Webb) Program is the principal contributor to the goal. Space Communications and Navigation also contributes to the goal.

Webb is an international collaboration among NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). ESA is providing the Ariane Launch Vehicle and some of the scientific instruments, including the Near Infrared Spectrometer and Mid-Infrared Instrument; and CSA is providing the Fine Guidance Sensor, which will enable Webb to point precisely, so that it can obtain high-quality images. Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems (NGAS) is the main NASA industrial contractor, responsible for building the optical telescope, spacecraft bus, and sunshield, and preparing the observatory for launch. NGAS is leading a team including three major sub-contractors: Ball Aerospace, ITT Exelis, and Alliant Techsystems.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Expanding the frontiers of knowledge, capability, and opportunity in space is an enduring and core goal for NASA. In the past decade alone, we increased our knowledge of the universe as evidenced by the discovery of more than 2,000 planets in other solar systems. Closer to home, we have expanded our exploration capabilities and sent out robotic sentinels to explore our solar system. The Curiosity rover landed more than 225 million kilometers from Earth and is actively exploring Mars. It has already accomplished its major science goal, discovering a location that could have supported microbial life in the past. We are planning to deepen our knowledge of the working of the interior of planetary bodies by placing a highly sensitive seismometer and associated geophysical instruments on the surface of Mars with the InSight mission. In 2020, we will continue our robotic exploration of Mars with a rover largely built upon the successful Curiosity rover and equipped with new, advanced instruments for in situ studies. It will prepare a scientifically selected cache of Mars samples that may be returned to Earth in the future for detailed analysis seeking possible signs of ancient life.
We are undertaking the detailed examination of near-Earth asteroids to determine what they can tell us about the early solar system, and whether any of these objects pose a threat to Earth. We are expanding our Near Earth Object Observation program, to find candidates for the proposed asteroid mission, and to catalogue asteroids larger than 140 meters across. Specifically, NASA will seek to increase the number of asteroid observations by the amateur astronomer community as a part of the Asteroid Grand Challenge. In 2016, we will launch the OSIRIS-REx mission to robotically approach and return a sample from a carbonaceous asteroid. This will aid in our investigation of planet formation and the origin of life in our solar system, as well as our understanding of asteroids that could impact Earth.
The missions we pursue under this goal help address national challenges and are allowing us to take advantage of unique opportunities to bring benefits to the Nation. For example:

• We are moving forward with critical research and technology demonstrations on the ISS.

Great advances in understanding human health have come from research on the ISS, which
can help prepare us for long-duration space travel, as well as improve the quality of life for aging populations on Earth.

• We are contributing to healthy, cutting-edge manufacturing and aerospace sectors.

For SLS, we are using 3D manufacturing technology to print custom parts for the system, marking a revolution in manufacturing.

• We are enabling a robust commercial space industry.

We are leveraging our public-private partnerships to lower launch costs and create more opportunities for commercial space flight.

• We are adding to the scientific understanding that may be needed to protect Earth.

Our proposed asteroid initiative, comprised of both a bold new mission to an asteroid and a global grand challenge to find all asteroid threats to human populations, will help identify the threats posed by some asteroids as well as teach us how to possibly avoid future impacts.

• We are moving outward, beyond low Earth orbit, into the broader solar system.

We are developing SLS and the Orion to carry astronauts farther into space than humans have ever been.

</objective_statement><objective_overview>NASA leads the Nation and the world on a continuing journey to answer profound questions: How does the universe work? How did we get here? Are we alone? The scope of astrophysics is truly breathtaking, ranging from the birth of the universe and the development of stars and galaxies over cosmic time, to the search for life on planets around other stars.
NASA’s astrophysics missions explore the extreme physical conditions of the universe and study the building blocks of our own existence at the most basic level: the space, time, matter, and energy that created the universe. Our telescopes have already measured the current age of the universe to be about 13.7 billion years and have uncovered remarkable new phenomena, such as the mysterious dark energy that dominates the universe. In the future, they will probe the origin and destiny of the universe, including the first moments of the Big Bang and the nature of black holes, dark energy, dark matter, and gravity.
We seek to understand the origin and evolution of the universe, as well as understand the processes for life on other planets. NASA’s observatories allow astronomers to explore the processes of formation of stars, galaxies, and planets. We have observed star formation occurring when the universe was at only a few percent its current age. The upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will allow us to uncover the mysteries of star formation at an even earlier age, as well as study in detail planets around other stars.
We are navigating a voyage of unprecedented scope and ambition: seeking to discover and study planets orbiting around other stars and to explore whether they could harbor life. NASA’s astrophysics missions, in conjunction with ground-based telescopes, have already confirmed the existence of over 2,000 extrasolar planets. Of even greater interest, we are now finding that there are many small, rocky extrasolar planets where liquid water could exist. In the future, NASA’s telescopes will continue this breathtaking journey, discovering new planets and observing signatures that could indicate possibilities for life.
