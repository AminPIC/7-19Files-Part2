By September 30, 2015, the Commercial Crew Program will complete the first phase of certification efforts with Commercial Crew Transportation partners, and will make measurable progress toward the second certification phase with industry partners while maintaining competition.

&amp;nbsp;
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>The Commercial Crew Program is helping facilitate the development of U.S. commercial crew space transportation capabilities with the goal of achieving safe, reliable, and cost effective access to and from low Earth orbit and the International Space Station (ISS). Enabling a U.S. industry-based capability can facilitate development of a commercial market, providing new high-technology jobs and reduce the cost of human access to space. A successful commercial market will further open the frontier for space exploration.

NASA is focused on ensuring that the current phase of crew system development, the Commercial Crew integrated Capability, (CCiCap), is successful at maturing the system designs and completing initial testing. Under CCiCap, U.S. space industry partners are working to mature designs of their integrated crew transportation systems, including spacecraft, launch vehicle, ground and mission systems.

In December 2012, NASA initiated the first phase of crew transportation systems certification by awarding three Certification Products Contracts (CPC). Under CPC, commercial partners are working with NASA to develop products that meet the agency's flight safety and performance requirements and specifications. This includes certification across all aspects of the integrated system, including the spacecraft, launch vehicle, and ground and mission operations. Integrated system verification plans, hazard reports, alternate standards and certification plans are being developed to ensure safe, crewed missions to and from the space station.

The second phase of certification will begin after CPC, and will involve a full and open competition. The second phase of certification will involve&amp;nbsp;final systems development, qualification and acceptance testing, orbital demonstration flights, and initial service flights of NASA crew to the International Space Station. By the end of FY 2015, measurable progress on this second phase of certification will be evidenced. Competition will be maintained.

All partners continued making technical and programmatic progress under their respective Commercial Crew Transportation Capability Space Act Agreements:


	Blue Origin completed the pusher escape system ground firing and a pad abort test. These tests are designed to demonstrate that a launch escape system can get the crew to safety in the event of an emergency on the launch pad.
	The Boeing Company (Boeing) accomplished several Critical Design Reviews (CDRs), including of the primary structures, the launch vehicle adapter, and software, as well as their integrated CDR. CDRs are significant reviews that demonstrate that a design is mature enough for production.
	The Sierra Nevada Corporation completed their integrated system safety review #2, main propulsion risk reduction testing, and continued preparation for their Engineering Test Article drop test.
	The Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX) conducted a pad abort test of the Crew Dragon spacecraft, integrated crew vehicle CDR, and primary structure qualification testing.


Under Certification Products Contracts (CPC), NASA’s industry partners began the next step in their plans to launch American astronauts from U.S. soil:


	Under CPC, NASA’s partners developed early lifecycle certification and verification products needed to start the process of certifying the crew transportation systems to carry NASA personnel to the International Space Station (ISS).
	All partners completed their respective CPC contract elements.
	In the third quarter of FY 2014, NASA finalized and closed out CPC, marking the end of the first certification phase of its commercial crew development efforts.


In September 2014, as part of the second phase of commercial crew development, NASA announced selection of its Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap) industry partners, Boeing and SpaceX, to continue development and certification efforts for their respective commercial crew transportation systems. The award was protested and, in January 2015, the Government Accountability Office rendered a decision in favor of NASA, allowing NASA and its industry partners to begin work in earnest. During FY 2015, NASA’s CCtCap partners continued making technical and programmatic progress maturing their crew transportation systems:


	Both partners completed their respective Certification Baseline Reviews early in their CCtCap effort. The Certification Baseline Reviews were among earliest major milestones on the CCtCap contracts, and included detailed plans for how NASA’s industry partners intend to achieve NASA certification of their launch systems.
	Boeing completed the Phase 2 Safety Review (Part B), delta Integrated CDR, Launch Segment CDR, and Qualification Test Vehicle production readiness review; and began modifications to Launch Pad 41, required to support crew ingress and egress.
	SpaceX completed their avionics test bed activation, and continue their Launch Pad 39A modification efforts, required to support commercial crew missions, as well as other SpaceX missions.



	SpaceX continues planning for their delta CDRs for this fall. SpaceX has dropped review products for their launch vehicle and ground systems CDR, scheduled for October.
	Both partners continue identifying and submitting variances, alternate standards, and hazard reports, necessary for the NASA’s crew transportation system certification effort.


NASA met its agency priority goal by the end of FY 2015. For its FY&amp;nbsp;2016-17 agency priority goal, the Commercial Crew Program, along with its industry partners, will continue to make measurable technical and programmatic progress toward the certification of commercial crew transportation systems, including the completion of at least one Design Certification Review.
</progress_update><themes><theme>General Science, Space, and Technology</theme></themes><contributing_programs_and_other_factors>Within NASA, the Commercial Crew Program is the principal contributor to the goal. The Commercial Crew Program facilitates the development of safe, reliable, and cost-effective human space transportation by the U.S. commercial industry to and from low Earth orbit and the International Space Station (ISS). The ISS Program also contributes to the goal through the development and maintenance of the transportation service, interface, and safety requirements associated with crewed flights to and from the ISS.

External to NASA, major contributors include the Federal Aviation Administration, Office of Commercial Space Transportation, which ensures that commercially-developed, human-rated transportation systems are safe for NASA personnel, and addresses cross-agency licensing issues; and the United States Air Force, 45th Space Wing, which addresses launch site processing and operations, including range safety. On September 16, 2014, NASA awarded Commercial Crew Transportation Capability contracts to the Boeing Company and Space Exploration Technologies Corporation to transport U.S. crews to and from the ISS by 2017.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Expanding the frontiers of knowledge, capability, and opportunity in space is an enduring and core goal for NASA. In the past decade alone, we increased our knowledge of the universe as evidenced by the discovery of more than 2,000 planets in other solar systems. Closer to home, we have expanded our exploration capabilities and sent out robotic sentinels to explore our solar system. The Curiosity rover landed more than 225 million kilometers from Earth and is actively exploring Mars. It has already accomplished its major science goal, discovering a location that could have supported microbial life in the past. We are planning to deepen our knowledge of the working of the interior of planetary bodies by placing a highly sensitive seismometer and associated geophysical instruments on the surface of Mars with the InSight mission. In 2020, we will continue our robotic exploration of Mars with a rover largely built upon the successful Curiosity rover and equipped with new, advanced instruments for in situ studies. It will prepare a scientifically selected cache of Mars samples that may be returned to Earth in the future for detailed analysis seeking possible signs of ancient life.
We are undertaking the detailed examination of near-Earth asteroids to determine what they can tell us about the early solar system, and whether any of these objects pose a threat to Earth. We are expanding our Near Earth Object Observation program, to find candidates for the proposed asteroid mission, and to catalogue asteroids larger than 140 meters across. Specifically, NASA will seek to increase the number of asteroid observations by the amateur astronomer community as a part of the Asteroid Grand Challenge. In 2016, we will launch the OSIRIS-REx mission to robotically approach and return a sample from a carbonaceous asteroid. This will aid in our investigation of planet formation and the origin of life in our solar system, as well as our understanding of asteroids that could impact Earth.
The missions we pursue under this goal help address national challenges and are allowing us to take advantage of unique opportunities to bring benefits to the Nation. For example:

• We are moving forward with critical research and technology demonstrations on the ISS.

Great advances in understanding human health have come from research on the ISS, which
can help prepare us for long-duration space travel, as well as improve the quality of life for aging populations on Earth.

• We are contributing to healthy, cutting-edge manufacturing and aerospace sectors.

For SLS, we are using 3D manufacturing technology to print custom parts for the system, marking a revolution in manufacturing.

• We are enabling a robust commercial space industry.

We are leveraging our public-private partnerships to lower launch costs and create more opportunities for commercial space flight.

• We are adding to the scientific understanding that may be needed to protect Earth.

Our proposed asteroid initiative, comprised of both a bold new mission to an asteroid and a global grand challenge to find all asteroid threats to human populations, will help identify the threats posed by some asteroids as well as teach us how to possibly avoid future impacts.

• We are moving outward, beyond low Earth orbit, into the broader solar system.

We are developing SLS and the Orion to carry astronauts farther into space than humans have ever been.
