</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Based on the most recent economic assumptions, we believe the demand for Social Security services will continue to remain at high levels. While operating in an environment of constrained resources, delivering high quality services that provide customers with the information and level of service they expect is an important aspect of our service delivery strategy. The Internet provides the public with the ability to conduct Social Security business at their convenience and at their own pace, without the need to travel to a field office or wait to meet with one of our representatives. In addition to being convenient, increased use of online services benefits the public and SSA by reducing the average time our employees spend processing claims, freeing them to handle workloads that are more complicated.

&amp;nbsp;

To facilitate these efforts, we recently implemented a new platform called my&amp;nbsp;Social&amp;nbsp;Security. After completing the secure registration process either online or by visiting one of our field offices, customers can obtain an online version of their Social Security Statement, which provides workers a convenient way to verify the accuracy of earnings posted to their Social Security records and to receive benefit estimates based on those earnings. Individuals who receive benefits can perform additional functions, such as checking their Social Security benefits, obtaining a benefit verification letter, and changing their address or direct deposit information. These services demonstrate our commitment to providing the American people with a secure, user-friendly way to conduct business with Social Security.

</next_steps><progress_update>&amp;nbsp;In Fiscal Year 2015, we reached 94% of the goal, with 6.64 million new&amp;nbsp;my Social Security accounts, (500,000 more registrations than in FY 2014). The registration count since inception in May 2012 equals 21,139,321. We continued to enhance the my Social Security portal by developing Customer Engagement Tools-Dynamic Help (DH) and Click to Call Back (CTCB) functions.&amp;nbsp; We are continuing to evaluate the success of the Customer Service Stations (CSS) kiosks in external locations.&amp;nbsp;


We participated in local, regional, and national my Social Security sign-up events nationwide. These included events in partnership with:
•&amp;nbsp;Aging associations such as AARP;
•&amp;nbsp;Affinity organizations such as LULAC, La Raza, the US Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, NAACP, and the Organization of Chinese Americans;
•&amp;nbsp;Financial organizations such as the Financial Planning Association;
•&amp;nbsp;Human resource organizations such as the Society for Human Resource Management;
•&amp;nbsp;Faith-based organizations; and
•&amp;nbsp;Young professional organizations.
•&amp;nbsp;In addition to our partnerships, we also:
•&amp;nbsp;Incorporated sign-up activities into all our speaker requests;
•&amp;nbsp;Conducted outreach through Facebook, Twitter, blogs, and webinars; and
•&amp;nbsp;Participated at Federal Agencies and Congressional events to promote the my Social Security account.


FY 2015 Quarterly Milestones Progress to date:


•&amp;nbsp;Q1 Milestone – In order to improve service to customers in need of a replacement Social Security card, we will provide the ability to request a replacement card via my Social Security.


	We completed approximately 90% of the iSSNRC (internet Social Security Number Replacement Card) planning and analysis activities and expect to complete the following activities in the 2nd Quarter of FY 2015:



	&amp;nbsp;Signoff of the Project Scope Agreement (PSA);
	&amp;nbsp;Completion of the Screen Package;
	&amp;nbsp;Complete Requirement gathering and begin development.


•&amp;nbsp;Q2 Milestone – In order to improve the quality of our services, we will evaluate customer satisfaction feedback for registration process and adjust accordingly.


	&amp;nbsp;In February, we completed a study of user feedback from the ForeSee E-Government Satisfaction Index.&amp;nbsp; We focused on feedback from users reporting they were unable to register online. Because these users typically are unable to adequately prove their identity online, the information we can provide them is extremely limited; however, the survey did identify possible improvements in general information that can be provided in response to registration problems.These suggestions are being incorporated into plans for future projects.


•&amp;nbsp;Q3 Milestone – In order to encourage more customers to use online services, we will release enhancements to the my Social Security portal.


	We released the my Medicare Replacement Card application behind the my Social Security portal in May 2015. Adding the myMRC application to the portal provides a more secure way of providing a replacement Medicare card. From the date of implementation, (May 30, 2015), through June request, 18,784 users were able to successfully request a replacement Medicare Card through their my Social Security account. Additionally, in the July 2015, the downloadable Statement will also be accessible via the portal. Finally, in September 2015, the Customer Engagement Tools (CET), specifically the Click-to-Callback feature, will be available within the my Social Security portal.


•&amp;nbsp;Q4 Milestone – In order to educate and inform stakeholders of the availability of our new online tools, we will conduct marketing and educational sessions targeted to the user and advocacy communities.


	&amp;nbsp;We held the National my Social Security week efforts from July 19-25, 2015, that included external partners promoting the my Social Security accounts.
	&amp;nbsp;We released a letter to Federal Agencies’ Chief of Staff to partner and promote the my Social Security account and online services.
