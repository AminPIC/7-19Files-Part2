	Provide credit assistance to 7,000 small and family operations, women, minority, and beginning farmers and ranchers through its Microloan program;
	Provide 3 percent of RBS funding to companies that produce or manufacture biobased products; and
	Provide assistance to develop the infrastructure for&amp;nbsp;450 new markets for local and regional food.

</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Although export opportunities and agricultural revenue are at historic highs, rural America continues to lose population.&amp;nbsp; A continued population drain from rural areas jeopardizes the economic stability of rural America and the many national assets that rural communities have historically stewarded.&amp;nbsp; In order to reverse the trend, USDA is investing in creating opportunities with potential to catalyze long-term economic growth and prosperity in rural America.&amp;nbsp; Areas of opportunity include supporting new and beginning farmers and ranchers, the bioeconomy, and local and regional food systems.

To achieve the goal, USDA will make strategic investments in the following areas:


	New and Beginning Farmers and Ranchers:&amp;nbsp; The Microloan program operated by the Farm Service Agency (FSA) is designed to help small and family operations, beginning, minority, and women farmers and ranchers to secure loans under $50,000 (Effective December 2014).&amp;nbsp; It is aimed at bolstering the progress of producers through their start-up years by providing needed resources and helping to increase equity so that farmers may eventually graduate to commercial credit and expand their operations. The Microloan program provides a less burdensome, simpler application process in comparison to traditional farm operating loans.&amp;nbsp; In addition, for those who want to grow niche crops to sell directly to ethnic markets and local farmers markets, the Microloan program offers a path to obtain financing.


&amp;nbsp;


	Biobased Companies:&amp;nbsp; USDA provides funding for biobased products, from the production of the renewable biomass feedstock through the sale of the resulting biobased product, including research and development for production, capital for startup businesses, and marketing and outreach.&amp;nbsp; USDA invests in the discovery and refinement of the best feedstocks and production systems for biomass through its research and development programs and partnerships.&amp;nbsp; Further, USDA provides financial and technical assistance to rural individuals, businesses, and communities to aid in sustainably producing and distributing renewable biomass resources.&amp;nbsp; USDA also leads the Federal effort to designate biobased products for preferred Federal procurement.&amp;nbsp; It is through these investments and partnerships that USDA will make strategic investment to support the creation of new biobased companies and associated economic opportunities in the coming years.


&amp;nbsp;


	Local and Regional Food Systems:&amp;nbsp; USDA supports the development of physical infrastructure, often in partnership with private lenders, and provides technical assistance in marketing, risk management, food safety practices and other areas. The Department also works to reach stakeholders who are unaware of available federal resources and works internally to ensure that USDA programs and policies meet the unique needs of local and regional supply chains. The long-term result will be job growth driven by a maturing market and accessible infrastructure to aggregate, process, and distribute local and regionally-produced foods.

Building on the successes achieved in FY 2013 and FY 2014, the microloan program continues to reach agricultural producers across the country as all states obligated at least one microloan in FY 2015.&amp;nbsp; A total of 6,596 microloans, valued at more than $161 million, were obligated in FY 2015.&amp;nbsp; More than 71 percent of the microloans were issued to beginning farmers and about 56 percent of loans went to new customers.&amp;nbsp; A total of 1,175 microloans, valued at nearly $27.3 million, were obligated to women and 505 microloans were obligated to veterans in FY 2015.&amp;nbsp; Program outreach continues through the use of links to the FSA website, State outreach plans, and materials such as microloan fact sheets and posters.&amp;nbsp;A microloan poster was recently completed that features veterans and farming.&amp;nbsp; The poster is being distributed widely to states for their use in outreach in heavily visited veteran outlets (e.g., VFWs, American Legions, and town halls).&amp;nbsp;News releases targeting human interest stories have been published.&amp;nbsp; One featured a veteran who used a microloan to begin a beef operation.&amp;nbsp; Another story highlighted former youth loan borrowers who have “graduated” on to microloans. A news release was published for both the 10,000 microloan and the 14,000 microloan. &amp;nbsp;In general, demand for microloans continues to exceed projectionsFSA added a handbook amendment with guidance from the Farm Bill that provided advice to loan officers on evaluating regional, local, and organic crops.&amp;nbsp; General audience marketing materials have been made available to FSA employees in order to facilitate requests for webinars and local training. The 2014 Farm Bill increased the microloan limit to $50,000.&amp;nbsp; The increased loan level became effective December 8th, 2014.

New Markets for Local and Regional Food

Building on our activities in FY13, USDA continues to prioritize new market opportunities in local and regional food systems through the development of infrastructure such as food hubs, scale-appropriate processing facilities, cold storage and regional distribution networks. In the first quarter of FY14, many of our programs issued NOFAs, so we anticipate results to be very heavily weighted toward the latter half of the fiscal year; Q1 saw 7 new markets developed with USDA assistance, 3 percent of our annual goal. This quarter focused on training and outreach to field offices working directly with applicants and to potential applicants interested in local food infrastructure. A webinar targeting food hubs was held by Rural Development to help potential applicants understand opportunities in our Value-Added Producer Grant program; over 200 food hubs participated. Calls were held with RD state offices staff focusing on outreach opportunities through the Community Facilities and Business and Industry Loan Guarantee programs. Work continues with FSA and AMS on opportunities in their programs to support infrastructure and technical assistance to facilitate new market connections.

Investment in Local and Regional Food Systems

As part of the President’s focus on open data and to facilitate connections between potential applicants and relevant federal programs, USDA tracks and makes available a database and map of federal investments in local and regional food systems. We began FY14 with a baseline of 1,980 investments tracked and made publicly available, representing investments for the years 2009-11. During Q1 of FY14, we reported an additional 398 investments, completing the dataset for FY12.

Farmers Markets and Food Hubs

At the close of FY 2015,&amp;nbsp;8,500 farmers markets were entered in the USDA National Farmers Market Directory and 303 food hubs were included in a national directory of food hubs curated by the Wallace Center at Winrock International, which partners with USDA to coordinate a national network of food hubs. Food hubs aggregate products from small and midsize farms and distribute them to large-volume buyers, such as grocery stores, in the local region. USDA investments help plan, design and build hubs, while USDA research informs best practices and helps lenders understand how to work with these unique businesses. On average, each food hub supports 20 jobs and generates nearly $4 million in annual sales.

Consumer Demand

This&amp;nbsp;external indicator of consumer demand provides us with information on the robustness of the market for locally-produced products. &amp;nbsp;As such, we do not have a target for this measure, which we update annually or semi-annually. The National Grocers Association 2013 and 2014 Consumer Panel Surveys reported that supermarkets that support local food sources appeal to the vast majority of consumers; both years, over 85% of consumers surveyed called this “very important” in their choice of a primary supermarket destination.&amp;nbsp;The National Restaurant Association’s 2013, 2014 and 2015 Chef Survey named locally-sourced meats and seafood and locally-sourced produce as the #1 and #2 “hottest trends” in the restaurant industry. The grocery industry analysis firm A.T Kearney estimated in 2014 that local food sales were worth $11.7 billion, and predicted that the market for local foods could grow to $20.2 billion by 2019. In 2015, A.T. Kearney predicted 9 percent annual growth in the local foods market at least through 2018.&amp;nbsp;
