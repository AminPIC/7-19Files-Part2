All workers have a right to a safe and healthful work environment. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) recognize that some workers are more vulnerable than others and that some workplaces are more hazardous than others. By strategically&amp;nbsp;conducting inspections and outreach in high-risk areas, in addition to completing mandated enforcement activity, DOL expects to have the greatest effect on overall compliance. With more employers in compliance, workplace injuries, fatalities, and illnesses should decline – the ultimate outcome for DOL and American workers.

Therefore, the Department will continue its commitment to the Agency Priority Goal of reducing injuries, illnesses and fatalities.

MSHA continues to use improved practices begun after the Upper Big Branch (UBB)&amp;nbsp;disaster to address noncompliance. MSHA's Impact Inspection program, targeting specific mines with compliance problems, is an important tool in agency enforcement efforts. Many of the inspections conducted under this program identified and cited previously concealed hazards and focused on poor compliance history or particular compliance concerns.

Evidence indicates this approach is working. From April 2010 through September 2015, MSHA conducted 1,025 impact inspections and issued 15,112 citations, 1,281 orders and 57 safeguards. A review of mines that received impact inspections since April 2010 shows that overall compliance is improving at these mines. As of March 31, 2015, violations per inspection hour decreased 18 percent, significant and substantial (S&amp;amp;S) violation rates decreased 28 percent, and rates of Section 104(d) violations for operators' unwarrantable failure to comply with mandatory safety and health standards decreased 55 percent. The lost time injury rate decreased four percent compared to the 12 months prior to each mine's first impact inspection.

In FY 2013, MSHA published a final rule to revise its regulation implementing Section 104(e) of the Mine Act's Pattern of Violation (POV) provision.&amp;nbsp;The old rule did not adequately achieve the intent of the Mine Act to address operators who have demonstrated a disregard for the safety and health of miners. The new rule simplifies the existing POV criteria, improves consistency in applying the POV criteria, and more adequately achieves the statutory intent. It also encourages chronic violators to comply with the Mine Act and MSHA's safety and health standards. Evidence from the POV process shows similar compliance improvement by operators. In 2010, the first year of the reforms, MSHA identified 51 mines meeting the screening criteria for further consideration for a POV notice. Since then there has been steady improvement, with 39 mines identified in the screening in 2011 and 20 mines identified in 2012. This is a 61 percent reduction between 2010 and 2012, using the same POV screening criteria. During the most recent screening in 2015, only one coal mine warranted further review. Upon completion of the review, no coal or metal and nonmetal mines met the criteria for further consideration of a POV notice. Not only are fewer mines being identified, but compliance with health and safety conditions at mines identified through the POV process has improved. As of March 31, 2015, the following impact on compliance at those mines compared to the six months prior to each mine's evaluation period shows the violations per inspection hour among the mines decreased 39 percent, S&amp;amp;S violation rates decreased by 64 percent and the rate of unwarrantable failure violations decreased by 82 percent. The lost time injury rate dropped by 50 percent compared to the 12 months prior to each mine's evaluation period. Moreover, the number of S&amp;amp;S violations dropped by 40 percent at the top 200 mines nationally since the 2010 POV reforms were put in place.&amp;nbsp; During the 2010 screening period, there were about 20,000 S&amp;amp;S violations issued at the top 200 mines.&amp;nbsp; Six years later, during the 2015 screening period, 12,000 S&amp;amp;S violations were issued, a significant reduction

MSHA has also taken a number of actions to give miners a better voice in the workplace on their own safety and health. In addition to swiftly responding to safety and health complaints by miners, MSHA, working with the Office of the Solicitor, filed 35 actions for temporary reinstatements, the second largest after 2012, when we filed 40.

MSHA is focusing on common causes of injuries to miners: developing ways to better understand what injuries and illnesses are occurring and where in the country they are occurring; and developing working relationships with stakeholders to understand needs and develop guidance and outreach to assist.

Sampling taken during the first year of the Respirable Coal Mine Dust Rule shows that compliance with the Rule is achievable.&amp;nbsp; Of the 61,885 samples that operators and MSHA collected from coal mines during the first year of the Rule---August 1, 2014 through July 31, 2015--- about 99 percent&amp;nbsp;did not exceed the compliance level. Moreover, operators’ average concentrations with the greatest dust exposures are at a new record low of .65 milligrams per cubic meter of air (mg/m3), which is far below the 1.5mg/m3 standard that will be effective on August 1, 2016 when the last phase of the Rule is implemented. That yearly average has dropped to historic lows each year following the End Black Lung –Act Now campaign launched in late 2009.

In FY 2015, MSHA continues on-site monitoring of approved instructors to ensure they are providing effective health and safety training to miners. MSHA is placing special emphasis on evaluation of contract instructors. MSHA has conducted 953 approved instructor evaluations in as of June 30, 2015.

MSHA has launched a number of initiatives to improve the Agency’s support for training in the mining industry.&amp;nbsp; The small mines field staff and educational field services staff merged into a single unit -- now the Educational Field and Small Mine Services (EFSMS) -- to better serve the mining community.&amp;nbsp; This merger is paying off, and MSHA is able to reach a greater number of small mines and work more directly with state mining associations and mining stakeholders.&amp;nbsp; This has resulted in improved working relations within MSHA and invaluable support for initiatives such as the recent ones aimed at reducing metal and nonmetal mining deaths.&amp;nbsp; MSHA added a new training page on the MSHA.gov website to provide training information and training material to the mining industry.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There is also a new industry page for operators to share their training materials with mining community and a new Part 50 training tool designed to assist mines on reporting of injuries and illnesses.

&quot;Rules&amp;nbsp;to Live By&quot;: Phase I of this multiphase initiative focused on the most common mining deaths and standards cited in mining death investigations. Phase II focused on preventing catastrophic accidents, and Phase III highlights 14 safety standards chosen because violations related to each have been cited as contributing at least five mining accidents and at least five deaths during a 10-year period from 2001 - 2010.

Clarifying regulations and processes: A key aspect of improving safety through outreach has been MSHA's efforts to improve compliance by clarifying its standards. Working with stakeholders, MSHA has implemented special initiatives to assist operators' compliance with MSHA standards, such as Guarding I and Guarding II that provide information on compliance with MSHA's guarding standards: the Fall Protection policy that uses OSHA's rule as guidance, and the new Ladder guidance, rolled out on February 5, 2014.

MSHA is improving data collection to better understand what diseases and injuries miners are experiencing and where by working with the public health community and stakeholders with the goal of improving enforcement and regulatory strategies. In FY 2013, MSHA established an occupational health working group that will provide cross-agency support on health hazards affecting miners.

In early 2010, MSHA began an initiative to identify gaps in the nation’s mine emergency capabilities.&amp;nbsp; A number of stakeholder meetings and a Mine Rescue Summit were held at MSHA’s Mine Academy to get their feedback and help on developing a plan. MSHA has made amazing progress since that time by developing and deploying state-of-the-art mine rescue technology; creating the Holmes Mine Rescue Association designating October 30th as “Mine Rescue Day;” and updating mine rescue training and revamping national mine rescue training contests. Part of this initiative included fully-equipped mine rescue stations across the country.&amp;nbsp; MSHA now has a Madisonville Mine Rescue Station, which was opened in September and has state-of-the-art technology.&amp;nbsp; This station joins the other stations in Pittsburgh, PA; Price, Utah; and Beckley, WV.

Another area where MSHA has made significant improvement, thanks to help from Congress, is in reducing the backlog of contested citations pending before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission. MSHA and Officer of the Solicitor (SOL) have worked together to reduce the total caseload to less than 20,000 citations as of July, 2015, from nearly 89,000 at the end of FY 2010, a 78 percent decrease.

In January 2012, MSHA implemented a pre-contest conferencing process to resolve citations before they become&amp;nbsp;a matter for litigation. As of September, 2015, MSHA had conferenced about 17,000 violations, 60 percent of which were not contested. In addition to litigation, MSHA has taken other steps to reduce the backlog, such as improving the consistency of enforcement and implementing its examination rule in&amp;nbsp;underground coal mines, a rule which requires operators to affirmatively find and fix violations of nine standards associated with ventilation, methane, roof control, combustible materials, rock dust, other safeguards, and guarding as violations of these standards, create unsafe conditions for underground coal miners.

In May 2015, MSHA launched an initiative requiring quarterly reports to be sent to MSHA Districts and Field Office Supervisors (FOS) showing summary results of contested citations and orders including the summary of changes to improve efficiency, consistency and sustaining of citations and orders.&amp;nbsp; Some MSHA field offices did not receive the results of the citations and orders issued by their offices and were unaware of the overall results of the contested violations.&amp;nbsp; Some field offices had a wider range of modifications of contested citations and orders than others.&amp;nbsp; The newly implemented web tool contains data on all settled citations and orders and will allow MSHA districts and field office supervisors to drill down into each settled citation and order to determine what was modified.

On September 30, 2015, MSHA announced it had provided $8.441 million in grants to 47 states and the Navaho Nation.&amp;nbsp; These grants support safety and health training courses and other programs.

In September 2015, MSHA launched its newly designed intranet.&amp;nbsp; MSHAnet has an entirely new and sleek platform resulting in a page that is less cluttered and more user- friendly.&amp;nbsp; Navigating the site is more intuitive and information easier to find as the content has been organized into a logical hierarchy.&amp;nbsp; Plus, the team spearheading the intranet and internet revamp has made some of the most popular content easily accessible via a new “Quick Links” menu.&amp;nbsp; It will be used to improve communications to MSHA staff with content about MSHA work added daily.

OSHA

In Q4 of FY 2015, OSHA continued to focus on preventing fall hazards through inspection targeting. &amp;nbsp;OSHA published the National Campaign to Prevent Falls in Construction Final Report on the 2014 &amp;amp; 2015 Safety Stand-Downs, which indicated that thousands of employers received certificates, and over 1 million workers and over 1.5 million military and civilian personnel participated in the Stand-Downs &amp;nbsp;OSHA partnered with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Center for Protection of Workers' Rights (CPWR), and the Department of Defense on the Stand-Downs. Fall protection continues to be the number one violation cited by OSHA. Falls are also the leading cause of death in the construction industry and account for 20% of all serious injuries. OSHA has National and Local Emphasis Plans (NEPs and LEPs), as well as a Strategic Plan that directs Compliance Safety and Health Officers (CSHOs) to those establishments with the most significant risk of fall hazards. In FY 2015, preliminary data shows that OSHA conducted about 11,024 inspections of worksites as a result of these programs, and about 9,133 fall-related violations were abated in FY 2015. This level of attention and proactive enforcement will directly impact the workers at these establishments by requiring abatement. &amp;nbsp;More generally, this enforcement activity will alert and educate other employers about fall hazards in the industries affected and in the local areas. It will also serve to incentivize employers to proactively assess and address fall hazards in order to avoid enforcement actions.

OSHA will also address establishments and corporations which have been shown to have serious fall hazards and react with callous indifference to serious fall hazards. OSHA has several programs which can be applied to achieve positive outcomes in these situations. These programs include the Severe Violators Enforcement Program and the Corporate-Wide Settlement Agreement program.

This Agency Priority Goal will continue as&amp;nbsp;a Department of Labor APG in FYs 2016 and 2017.
