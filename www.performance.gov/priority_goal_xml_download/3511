	Achieve full operational capability of the Joint Cybersecurity Coordination Center (JC3), including TS-SCI operations, by the end of FY 2015

</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Overview of the Environmental Management part of the goal:

The Department and its predecessor agencies generated radioactive liquid waste as a by-product of the production of nuclear weapons. The EM Program has an estimated 88 million gallons of highly radioactive waste from the legacy of the Cold War stored in 239 tanks at Idaho, the Savannah River Site and the Office of River Protection.&amp;nbsp; By reducing and disposing of the liquid waste tank wastes, EM is demonstrating tangible evidence of the program's goal to reduce the highest risks in the complex.&amp;nbsp; By eliminating high-risk material, corresponding life-cycle cost reductions are achieved for an activity that is a major cost driver to the EM program.&amp;nbsp;

Management and removal of legacy Transuranic (TRU) waste across the EM complex directly supports risk reduction and the goal of reducing the EM site footprint.&amp;nbsp; The EM Program also coordinates with all DOE sites that generate transuranic waste to retrieve, repackage, characterize, ship, and dispose of transuranic waste resulting in cleaning up sites, reducing risks, and decreasing the Department’s nuclear footprint.

Challenges for meeting EM’s Agency Priority Goal (the retrieval of tank waste, closing waste tanks and disposing of transuranic waste) include&amp;nbsp;designing, building, starting up, and operating complex, hazardous, and unique nuclear facilities.&amp;nbsp; These facilities include the Waste Treatment Plant in Hanford, Washington; the Integrated Waste Treatment Unit at Idaho National Laboratory; and the Salt Waste Processing Facility at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina.

Successful completion&amp;nbsp;of these cleanup goals depends on overcoming technical, quality assurance, schedule, regulatory, and management challenges. The Department will leverage past experience, applying best practices and lessons learned; identify, develop, and deploy practical technological solutions; and look for innovative and sustainable practices that make cleanup more efficient.

Overview of the Project Management&amp;nbsp;goal:

The Department of Energy (DOE) is the largest civilian contracting agency in the Federal Government and spends approximately 95% of its annual budget on contracts to operate its scientific laboratories, engineering and production facilities, and environmental restoration sites and to acquire capital assets. The Department has been challenged, both externally and internally, to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its contract and project management processes.&amp;nbsp; The Department remains committed to making continuous improvements in contract and project management performance.

DOE has been on the Government Accountability Office (GAO) High-Risk List since 1990.&amp;nbsp; During the past several years, the Department has launched and completed several initiatives to address its challenges including a Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and associated Corrective Action Plan (CAP) in 2008, Contract and Project Management Summit-related corrective actions, and issuance of several Deputy Secretary policy directives.&amp;nbsp; Many measurable improvements have been implemented resulting from these efforts to include:&amp;nbsp; improving front-end planning by requiring sufficient design maturity prior to establishing performance baselines; defining required project staff-size and required skill-set across the project lifecycle and enhancing training and qualifications of project and contract management personnel; stabilizing project funding and affordability by adhering to baseline funding profiles for incrementally funded projects in annual budget requests; strengthening DOE Order 413.3B inclusive of new independent cost estimating requirements at Critical Decision (CD) gateways; deploying a new and more robust Project Assessment and Reporting System (PARS II), which allows for direct upload of contractor project performance data; and implementing Project Peer Reviews, a best practice successfully employed by the Office of Science, across the Department to better monitor project development and execution and foster sharing of design, procurement and construction lessons learned.

Based on the Department’s progress, GAO narrowed the scope of the high-risk designation in 2009, removing the Office of Science and focusing on the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and the Office of Environmental Management (EM).&amp;nbsp; GAO issued a scorecard with five criteria for removing all DOE programs from the High-Risk List:


	Demonstrate strong commitment and leadership;
	Demonstrate progress in implementing corrective measures;
	Develop a corrective action plan that identifies root causes, effective solutions, and a near-term plan for implementing the solutions;
	Have the capacity (people and resources) to resolve problems; and
	Monitor and independently validate the effectiveness and sustainability of corrective measures.


GAO acknowledged the Department met the first three of these criteria in February 2011.&amp;nbsp; In GAO’s February 2013 High-Risk List update, GAO acknowledged the Department’s continuing improvement in contract and project management by shifting the focus of DOE’s high-risk designation to major contracts and projects executed by NNSA and EM with values of $750 million or greater.

Progress toward achieving this goal, project success, is tracked in the Department’s Project Assessment and Reporting System (PARS II) and reported to Program Offices, GAO and OMB on a quarterly basis.

Overview of the JC3 part of the goal:

The Joint Cybersecurity Center (JC3) is a Departmental enterprise asset designed to improve information sharing and coordinated incident response for all cybersecurity events. Accordingly the DOE Chief Information Officer (CIO) is responsible for developing and maintaining the Department’s overall cybersecurity strategy in coordination with the Undersecretaries of Science &amp;amp; Energy, Nuclear Security, and Management &amp;amp; Performance.

&amp;nbsp;
</next_steps><progress_update>Progress Update for the Environmental Management part of the goal:

At the end of the fourth quarter of FY 2015, the EM program is expected to disposition a cumulative total of 100,016 cubic meters of combined Remote Handled and Contact Handled Transuranic Waste in addition to any TRU waste that was characterized and disposed as Low Level Waste or Mixed Low Level Waste. &amp;nbsp;At the end of the fourth quarter FY 2015, the EM program EM Program has been targeting to close two additional tanks for a cumulative total of 15 liquid waste tanks closed.


	At the end of the fourth quarter of FY 2015, the EM program&amp;nbsp;dispositioned a cumulative total of 102,026 cubic meters of&amp;nbsp;combined Remote Handled and Contact Handled Transuranic Waste which included TRU waste that was characterized and&amp;nbsp;disposed as Low Level Waste or Mixed Low Level Waste.

	
		​Did not meet final goal.&amp;nbsp; Transuranic waste dispositioned: Waste that is removed from a site's transuranic (TRU) waste inventory (i.e., waste that is currently managed at the site as transuranic waste) through the following methods:

		*&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Shipped from the site to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) for disposal as TRU waste;
		*&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Removed from the TRU waste inventory by some other means (e.g., re-characterization and disposal as waste other than TRU waste or otherwise dispositioned such as being shipped to another site for further characterization and/or repackaging for ultimate disposal). Including both remote-handled and contact-handled TRU waste.
		Therefore, any TRU waste that is currently in inventory that has been characterized as LLW or MLLW and disposed at an approved LLW/MLLW site is counted as completed.
		[This LLW/MLLW disposal may be the NNSS Site, Energy Solutions, or an approved operating on-site disposal cell).&amp;nbsp; Any remaining TRU waste that has been fully processed and characterized that is waiting to be sent to WIPP for final disposal is NOT counted in the cumulative actual reported.
		
	
	



	At the end of the fourth quarter FY 2015, the EM program EM Program has closed one additional tanks for a cumulative total of 14 liquid waste tanks closed. Did not meet final goal.


Progress Update for the Project Management part of the goal:

The Department is managing some of the largest, most complex, and technically challenging projects in the public or private sector.&amp;nbsp; Many are first-of-a-kind, one-of-a-kind projects that involve the risks and challenges of nuclear operations.

The GAO narrowed its high risk list to EM’s and NNSA’s major contracts and projects over $750 million.&amp;nbsp; The Department remains focused on continuous improvement in contract and project management and being removed from GAO’s list entirely in the future.&amp;nbsp; This will not be easy as the Department continues to struggle on implementing corrective actions on its largest legacy projects which were initiated prior to the overhaul of DOE’s project management governance structure and development of corrective actions.

The Department’s project management governance structure and processes comport with industry best practices.&amp;nbsp; Together, they have produced significant improvement in the Department’s ability to deliver non-major system projects (projects less than $750M).&amp;nbsp; Experience since 2008 has shown that the process and policy improvements made to manage the non-major projects in our portfolio are applicable and scalable to our largest projects.&amp;nbsp; With focused leadership, proper implementation and oversight, and accountability, these processes and policies can improve major system project delivery.

Did not meet annual target. &amp;nbsp;78% of 90% achieved. Performance to be addressed at Secretarial-level Project Management Risk Committee

Q4&amp;nbsp;FY15 Milestones:


	Prepare for factual accuracy review a DOE Earned Value Management System Interpretation Handbook.

Environmental Management

The Office of Environmental Management (EM) supports the Department’s Strategic Plan to continue cleanup of radioactive and chemical waste resulting from the Manhattan Project and Cold War activities. The EM program was established in 1989 and is responsible for the cleanup of millions of gallons of liquid radioactive waste, thousands of tons of spent (used) nuclear fuel and special nuclear material, disposition of large volumes of transuranic and mixed/low-level waste, huge quantities of contaminated soil and water, and deactivation and decommissioning of thousands of excess facilities. This is the largest environmental cleanup program in the world brought about from five decades of nuclear weapons development and production and Government-sponsored nuclear energy research. It involves some of the most dangerous materials known to humankind.

&amp;nbsp;

In carrying out the program’s cleanup mission, EM performs a variety of collaborative activities. A key component for EM work involves Regulatory Compliance, which is discussed below:

&amp;nbsp;

• Regulatory Compliance: DOE negotiates and executes environmental compliance and cleanup agreements with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and state regulatory agencies, as well as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as appropriate. Key parameters such as required cleanup levels and milestones must be negotiated with the appropriate regulators and stakeholders for each site. Compliance with environmental laws and agreements continues to be a major cost driver for the EM program.
