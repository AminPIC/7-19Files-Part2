</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Problem or opportunity being addressed

EPA’s Superfund, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) corrective action (CA), leaking underground stor­age tank (LUST), and Brownfields cleanup programs reduce risks to human health and the envi­ronment by assessing and cleaning up contaminated sites to enhance the livability and economic vitality of neighborhoods. Challenging and complex environmental problems, such as the presence or perceived presence of hazardous substances in soil, sediment, and ground­water, persist at many contaminated properties, and can threaten the health of American families.

There are multiple benefits associated with cleaning up contaminated sites and making them ready for reuse: reducing mortality and morbidity risk; preventing and reducing human exposure to contaminants; making land available for commercial, residential, industrial, or recreational reuse; and promoting community economic development. When sites are ready for anticipated reuse, communities are able to reclaim them for ecological, recreational, commercial, residential and other productive purposes.

Since EPA began collecting the number of sites ready for anticipated use (RAU) in FY2008, the cumulative number of sites RAU has increased. As of the end of FY2013, 441,333 sites were made ready for anticipated use, or approximately 83% of all sites.

Although each program establishes its own targets, the collective nature and combined overall target of the RAU Priority Goal offers an opportunity for EPA cleanup programs to work together to identify lessons learned, efficiencies and opportunities to advance site cleanup.

&amp;nbsp;

Efficiencies and cost savings 

In an effort to improve the accountability, transparency, and effectiveness of EPA’s cleanup programs, EPA initiated the Integrated Cleanup Initiative, a multi-year effort to better use the most appropriate assessment and cleanup authorities to address a greater number of sites, accelerate cleanups where possible, and put those sites back into productive use while protecting human health and the environment. By using relevant tools available in each of the cleanup programs, including enforcement, EPA will better leverage the resources available to address needs at individual sites. EPA will focus on enforcement activities that are critical to ensuring that responsible parties are compelled to clean up contaminated sites, thereby preserving federal monies for clean up at sites where viable responsible parties do not exist.

&amp;nbsp;

Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives

The Priority Goal directly supports EPA’s FY2014-2018 Strategic Plan, specifically Goal 3: Cleaning Up Communities and Advancing Sustainable Development.&amp;nbsp; Over the next several years, two of EPA’s priorities under this goal are to prevent and reduce exposure to contaminants and accelerate the pace of cleanups across the country. RAU is an indicator that the local, state, or federal agency has determined that cleanup goals and engineering and institutional controls have been implemented for the media that affects current and reasonably anticipated future use so that the sites are available for communities to use or reuse.&amp;nbsp;Making contaminated sites ready for anticipated reuse also supports several of the Administrator’s Themes for EPA, including Making a Visible Difference in Communities across the Country; Launching a New Era of State, Tribal and Local Partnerships; and Working Toward a Sustainable Future. These connections are further described in the overview of our goal, as well as our description of goal partners.

The Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response (OSWER) tracks over 500,000 sites, representing more than 23 million acres of land.&amp;nbsp; EPA’s Superfund, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) corrective action (CA), leaking underground stor¬age tank (LUST), and Brownfields cleanup programs reduce risks to human health and the envi¬ronment by assessing and cleaning up contaminated sites to enhance the livability and economic vitality of neighborhoods.&amp;nbsp; Challenging and complex environmental problems, such as the presence or perceived presence of hazardous substances in soil, sediment, and ground¬water, persist at many contaminated properties, and can threaten the health of American families.

EPA accomplished a total of 10,675 sites in FY 2015, for a total Result of 21,836 RAU sites for FY 14/15 RAU, surpassing its target for FY14/15 of 18,970 by 15%. Although each program establishes its own targets, the collective nature and combined overall target of the RAU&amp;nbsp; Priority Goal offers an opportunity for EPA cleanup programs to work together to identify lessons learned, efficiencies and opportunities to advance site cleanup. Since EPA began collecting the number of sites RAU in FY 2008, the number of sites RAU has increased by approximately 22% to over 463,500 sites at the end of FY 2015, which is approximately 87% of total number of sites EPA tracks.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;

However, it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain the pace of RAU.&amp;nbsp; Over the past few years, the number of Superfund sites RAU has consistently decreased and the number of RCRA corrective action sites made RAU is slowing down.&amp;nbsp; Many of the remaining sites are some of the most complex facilities which extends the timeline to achieve site cleanup.&amp;nbsp; Maintaining RAU as the priority goal focuses senior management attention on an important indicator of program outcomes.

The lead office is the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response (OSWER).&amp;nbsp; The key official is Barry Breen, the Principal Deputy Assistant Administrator of OSWER. All of OSWER’s cleanup programs (Superfund, RCRA corrective action, Brownfields, and LUST) contribute to this goal and take positive action to protect human health and the environment through the cleanup and revitalization of contaminated properties. OSWER programs collaborate with EPA’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assistance to deliver environmental results as One EPA.

Contributing programs or partners outside the agency 

EPA recognizes that it must work in concert with the states, tribes, local governments, and sister federal agencies that constitute our country's environmental protection enterprise, to ensure the efficiency, efficacy, and coordination of our overlapping and complementary efforts.&amp;nbsp; In some cases, states are authorized to operate cleanup programs, while in others they are partners. Where other federal agencies are designated as the lead for the cleanup actions at their sites, EPA's environmental cleanup goals are subject to, and reliant on, the lead federal agencies' cleanup budgets, execution, and site cleanup performance. EPA recognizes the need to work with our co-regulators to build tools and strategies that enhance coordination and manage resources effectively.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Uncontrolled releases of waste and hazardous substances can contaminate our drinking water and land and threaten healthy ecosystems.  Local land use and infrastructure investments can also generate unanticipated environmental consequences, such as increased stormwater runoff, loss of open space, and increased greenhouse gas emissions.  EPA leads efforts to preserve, restore, and protect our land, air, and water so that these precious resources are available for both current and future generations.  We will continue our work to prevent and reduce exposure to contaminants, accelerate the pace of cleanups, and reduce the environmental impacts associated with land use across the country.  EPA works collaboratively with international, state, and tribal partners to achieve these aims.  In addition, we will work with communities to address risks posed by intentional and accidental releases of hazardous substances into the environment and ensure that communities have an opportunity to participate in environmental decisions that affect them.  Our efforts are guided by scientific data, research, and tools that alert us to emerging issues and inform decisions on managing materials and addressing contaminated properties.
