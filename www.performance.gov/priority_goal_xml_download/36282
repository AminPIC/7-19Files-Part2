By September 30, 2017, NASA will increase the occupancy of the ISS internal and external research facility sites with science and technology payload hardware to 75 percent.
&amp;nbsp;
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>The continued operation and use of the International Space Station (ISS) is critical to achieving NASA’s and the Nation’s goals in conducting science, demonstrating technology, enabling a commercial market in low Earth orbit, and propelling human spaceflight into the solar system. The research occurring aboard the space station, which is the world’s only continuously-crewed&amp;nbsp;orbiting, microgravity research and development laboratory, is helping NASA prepare to send astronauts into deep space and is providing tangible benefits to everyone on Earth.

NASA’s goal is to increase utilization of the ISS for exploration related technology development; to foster commercial investment in space; and to conduct scientific research. As an operational and multi-disciplinary research laboratory, with research coming from a wide variety of sources, it is important to characterize how the laboratory is being used and progress toward maximizing utilization of the laboratory.

</next_steps><progress_update>NASA successfully completed its fourth quarter milestone to launch payloads and payload resupply to the International Space Station (ISS). SpaceX-9 launched on July 18, 2016, carrying more than 5,000 pounds of supplies and payloads to the ISS, including the International Docking Adaptor (IDA-2), rodent research, the Heart Cells experiment, and NanoRacks student payloads. It returned with 3,000 pounds of research and cargo on August 26, 2016, including the first live return of mice from the ISS. The 5th ISS Research and Development Conference was conducted July 12 - 14, 2016 in San Diego, CA with over 600 attendees from industry, government, and academia.
</progress_update><themes><theme>General Science, Space, and Technology</theme></themes><contributing_programs_and_other_factors>Within NASA, the Human Research Program, Human Space Flight Operations Program, Space Life and Physical Sciences Research and Applications Division, Science Mission Directorate, and International Space Station (ISS) Program are the principal contributors to the goal. The ISS Program manages the contracts for Commercial Resupply Services, which procure commercial cargo service; and the international partnership, which coordinates resupply vehicles. The Space Communications and Navigation and Commercial Crew Programs also contribute to the goal.

External to NASA, major contributors include the Federal Aviation Administration, which issues licenses that allow the launch of cargo flights to the ISS and entry back to the ground. For crew transportation, services are provided by Roscosmos, the Russian Federal Space Agency; and cost-sharing partners include the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), European Space Agency (ESA), and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). For cargo transportation, services are provided by Orbital Sciences Corporation, Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, ESA, JAXA, and Roscosmos; and cost-sharing partners include CSA, ESA, and JAXA.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Expanding the frontiers of knowledge, capability, and opportunity in space is an enduring and core goal for NASA. In the past decade alone, we increased our knowledge of the universe as evidenced by the discovery of more than 2,000 planets in other solar systems. Closer to home, we have expanded our exploration capabilities and sent out robotic sentinels to explore our solar system. The Curiosity rover landed more than 225 million kilometers from Earth and is actively exploring Mars. It has already accomplished its major science goal, discovering a location that could have supported microbial life in the past. We are planning to deepen our knowledge of the working of the interior of planetary bodies by placing a highly sensitive seismometer and associated geophysical instruments on the surface of Mars with the InSight mission. In 2020, we will continue our robotic exploration of Mars with a rover largely built upon the successful Curiosity rover and equipped with new, advanced instruments for in situ studies. It will prepare a scientifically selected cache of Mars samples that may be returned to Earth in the future for detailed analysis seeking possible signs of ancient life.
We are undertaking the detailed examination of near-Earth asteroids to determine what they can tell us about the early solar system, and whether any of these objects pose a threat to Earth. We are expanding our Near Earth Object Observation program, to find candidates for the proposed asteroid mission, and to catalogue asteroids larger than 140 meters across. Specifically, NASA will seek to increase the number of asteroid observations by the amateur astronomer community as a part of the Asteroid Grand Challenge. In 2016, we will launch the OSIRIS-REx mission to robotically approach and return a sample from a carbonaceous asteroid. This will aid in our investigation of planet formation and the origin of life in our solar system, as well as our understanding of asteroids that could impact Earth.
The missions we pursue under this goal help address national challenges and are allowing us to take advantage of unique opportunities to bring benefits to the Nation. For example:

• We are moving forward with critical research and technology demonstrations on the ISS.

Great advances in understanding human health have come from research on the ISS, which
can help prepare us for long-duration space travel, as well as improve the quality of life for aging populations on Earth.

• We are contributing to healthy, cutting-edge manufacturing and aerospace sectors.

For SLS, we are using 3D manufacturing technology to print custom parts for the system, marking a revolution in manufacturing.

• We are enabling a robust commercial space industry.

We are leveraging our public-private partnerships to lower launch costs and create more opportunities for commercial space flight.

• We are adding to the scientific understanding that may be needed to protect Earth.

Our proposed asteroid initiative, comprised of both a bold new mission to an asteroid and a global grand challenge to find all asteroid threats to human populations, will help identify the threats posed by some asteroids as well as teach us how to possibly avoid future impacts.

• We are moving outward, beyond low Earth orbit, into the broader solar system.

We are developing SLS and the Orion to carry astronauts farther into space than humans have ever been.

</objective_statement><objective_overview>NASA’s contribution to society starts with scientific and technological achievement, but extends much further. We are using our resources to spur exploration as well as the new and robust commercial space market. The continued operation of the ISS is critical to achieving NASA’s and the Nation’s goals in science, technology, and human spaceflight. The ISS is the world’s only orbiting, microgravity research and development (R&amp;amp;D) laboratory where researchers may perform multidisciplinary research and technology development to prepare for our exploration of the solar system. Results of research projects will continue to yield benefits in areas such as human health, telemedicine, physical science, Earth observations, space science, and education programs that inspire future scientists, engineers, and space explorers. The Center for Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS), is the sole manager of the ISS National Laboratory, which is a portion of the ISS, and is working to maximize use of the ISS for research in space. The Administration’s decision to extend ISS operations until at least 2024 will allow us to maximize its potential and maintain American leadership in space.
The ISS is proving to be a catalyst for the growing commercial space enterprise, as well as a critical springboard for our future space exploration goals. NASA is buying hundreds of millions of dollars of cargo flights from new commercial launch services providers. With the collaboration of five space agencies, 15 nations, and private companies, the ISS is a model for cooperation on future human space exploration missions beyond low Earth orbit.
