</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>When a small business is awarded a government contract, the small business is often able to quickly create jobs and spur economic growth.&amp;nbsp; The government agency often has a “direct line” to the CEO, helping ensure that products and services are meeting or exceeding expectations and serving America’s taxpayers.&amp;nbsp; Also, underserved communities – including women, minorities, veterans and others – often have extreme difficulty in accessing federal contracting opportunities as market gaps remain.&amp;nbsp; SBA’s unique contracting programs provide a path to business growth for these populations.

Congress has mandated that small businesses receive 23% of federal government prime contracting dollars, including 5% of prime and subcontracts to Small Disadvantage Businesses; 5% of prime and subcontracts to Women-Owned Small Businesses; 3% of prime and subcontracts to HUBZone Small Businesses; and 3% of prime and subcontracts to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses.

Meeting and exceeding the federal government’s small business procurement goals continues to be an Administration priority.&amp;nbsp; Federal contracting with small businesses is a win-win.&amp;nbsp; Small businesses get the revenue they need to grow their businesses and create jobs, and the federal government gets the opportunity to work with some of America’s most innovative and nimble small businesses, often times with a direct line to the CEO.

This Priority Goal directly supports SBA’s strategic objectives:


	Strategic Objective 1.2 – Ensure federal contracting goals are met or exceeded by collaborating across the federal government to expand opportunities for small businesses and strengthen the integrity of the federal contracting certification process and data.
	Strategic Objective 2.1 – Ensure inclusive entrepreneurship by expanding access and opportunity to small businesses and entrepreneurs in communities where market gaps remain


Small businesses are agile, innovative and affordable partners for the federal government.&amp;nbsp; Through small business contracting, the federal government acts as a catalyst for small business growth, innovation, and supports the national economic security of the nation. Congress designated SBA as the agency responsible for overseeing small business contracting across the federal government.&amp;nbsp; The SBA takes this responsibility seriously as the strongest voice for small business across the Administration.

Key barriers and challenges:


	The unpredictable and changing budget climate is a challenge for small businesses, and SBA is working hard to create an environment where small businesses can be successful in the federal procurement marketplace.&amp;nbsp;
	The instability and ambiguity caused by Continuing Resolutions make it difficult to agency acquisition staff to plan effectively for small business utilization.
	Entering the federal supply chain can often be a lengthy and arduous process for many small businesses.
	The Administration and SBA continue to increase efforts and collaboration to provide more opportunities for small businesses to compete for and win federal contracts.
	Strategic Sourcing, Bundling, and Contracting Consolidation continue to be major concerns for small business opportunity and expansion.&amp;nbsp; While the government strives to balance affordability with opportunity, SBA engages with agencies to continue to promote broader competitive opportunities to ensure the health of the small business industrial base is not adversely affected due to strategic sourcing or consolidating requirements and to protect small business from contract bundling.


SBA must continue to implement effective and efficient strategies to monitor the agencies’ progress, support small businesses interested in working with the government, and improve the data quality agencies use to manage their contracting activities.

</next_steps><progress_update>By law, 23 percent of federal government prime contracting dollars are set-aside for small businesses, which includes 5 percent of prime and subcontracts to small disadvantaged businesses and women-owned small businesses and 3 percent of prime and subcontracts to HUBZone small businesses and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. In FY 2016, Quarter 3, SBA published the FY 2015 Small Business Procurement Scorecard.&amp;nbsp; In FY 2015, the federal government surpassed its prime contracting goal and small businesses were awarded $90.7 billion in contracting dollars. Performance in all the small business prime contracting and socio-economic categories showed significant improvement. The SBA surpassed its goals for service-disabled veterans (FY 2015 result was 3.93 percent) and small disadvantaged businesses (FY 2015 result was 10.06 percent) due in part to the successful Mentor-Protégé program that fosters relationships between successful firms and disadvantaged small businesses. The number of small business contracting dollars going to women-owned small businesses increased from 4.68 percent in FY 2014 to 5.06 percent in FY 2015.&amp;nbsp; The SBA worked with the Office of Federal Procurement Policy to integrate small business data quality reviews (anomaly reports) into each agency’s contracting processes and procedures. &amp;nbsp;As a result, 19 of the 24 CFO-Act agencies exceeded their individual agency goal.

In FY 2016, the SBA has implemented many of the contracting provisions contained in the Small Business Jobs Act (SBJA) of 2010 and the National Defense Authorization Acts (NDAAs) of 2013, 14, 15 and 16 related to increasing opportunities for small business contracting and minimizing fraud, waste and abuse in small business contracting programs. SBA finalized rules&amp;nbsp;on subcontracting, setting aside multiple-award contracts and orders for small businesses, consolidation, size, and status integrity.&amp;nbsp; The SBA issued a final rule addressing new limitations on subcontracting provisions that apply to set aside contracts, which authorize similarly situated entities to team together to perform set aside contracts; the rule also made it easier for firms to perform contracts as joint ventures and updated its rules on the non-manufacturer rule, as well as aligning HUBZone rules with the rules of the other socioeconomic programs to make the HUBZone program more competitive.&amp;nbsp;Furthermore, a final mentor protégé rule was issued in July 2016.&amp;nbsp; This rule allows any small business to enter into a mentor protégé relationship with a mentor that will provide technical, management, financial or other assistance to the protégé.&amp;nbsp; The approved mentor-protégé firms may also enter into joint ventures to perform government contracts and be considered small and or eligible for set aside or sole source contracts, based on the status of the protégé.&amp;nbsp; SBA also sent a final rule to OMB for interagency review in the 4th quarter which implements Section 1614 of the NDAA of 2014, which provides that other-than-small business concerns with small business subcontracting plans shall establish goals and report on performance at the first tier of subcontracting as well as lower tiers. These rules will give agencies the tools they need to increase small business utilization.&amp;nbsp;

The SBA issued external and internal guidance for the second phase of the streamline process of initial applications in the HUBZone Office&amp;nbsp;resulting in an average processing time of 77 days, a 39% reduction from the Quarter 2 processing timeframes of 126 days.&amp;nbsp; SBA provided HUBZone education to approximately 1,736 individuals through trainings to acquisition and small business specialist from various Federal agencies, and via Destination HUB events in Ohio, Michigan, Texas, New Jersey, and New York. The HUBZone office drafted the final rule implementing sections of the NDAA of 2016, which authorized the following:&amp;nbsp; 1) Native Hawaiian Organizations to own HUBZone small business concerns; &amp;nbsp;2) expanded the definition of “base closure area” (aka BRACs) under the HUBZone program by extending HUBZone eligibility for BRACs to 8 years (up from 5), 3) Expanded HUBZone eligibility to neighboring census tracts and non-metropolitan counties; and 4) Authorized the inclusion of “qualified disaster areas” under the HUBZone program.&amp;nbsp; It is expected that the rule will become final during the 1st quarter of 2017.&amp;nbsp;

Additionally, in Quarter 4, FY 2016 SBA began conducting its annual prime contracting compliance Surveillance Reviews (SR). The SR evaluates federal agency’s procurement center small business programs, performance, policies, practices and execution to provide maximum practicable opportunity for small business concerns. These thirty-one (31) reviews were completed in Quarter 4.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, SBA continued the phased launch of the new SBA One Contracting portal, which established a new portal for WOSB Federal Contract Program participants. This investment improves responsiveness to WOSB/EDWOSB applicants; enhances verification of eligibility and improve contracting officer ability to award contracts.&amp;nbsp; Phase one supported WOSB/EDWOSB documentation into a new Repository. SBA also conducted five (5) ChallengeHER events in Quarter 4, FY 2016.&amp;nbsp; These education events were held in Tuscon, AZ; Miami, FL; New Orleans, LA; St. Louis, MO; and Long Beach, CA.&amp;nbsp;

The SBA also achieved the following during Q4:


	Chaired three (3) Small Business Procurement Advisory Council Meetings to provide updates on small business programs and share best practices
	Held small business recruitment events throughout SBA’s 68 District Offices through ChallengeHER, Destination HUB, and other outreach activities and events&amp;nbsp;
	Worked with 24 CFO-Act agencies to provide input on revised small business scorecard methodology and submitted final recommended guidance to OFPP.&amp;nbsp; Authorization to proceed was granted by OFPP.
	Provided the 24 CFO-Act agencies with their proposed FY2017 prime and subcontracting small business procurement goals.
	Completed report on Annual Prime Contracting and Subcontracting Compliance Reviews of&amp;nbsp; federal agency and private industry large businesses to reflect maximum small business opportunity
	Continued training and working with agencies to identify opportunities for 8(a) firms
	Conducted FY 2016 Surveillance Reviews on Federal Agency Performance

</progress_update><themes><theme>Community and Regional Development</theme></themes><contributing_programs_and_other_factors>The SBA’s Office of Government Contracting and Business Development (GCBD) is responsible for ensuring that the federal government meets the statutorily defined goals for small business procurement.&amp;nbsp; Each year, SBA negotiates with agencies to establish individual goals that, in the aggregate, constitute the government-wide goals. &amp;nbsp;GCBD encourages, monitors, and facilitates the sharing of best practices in government contracting with chief acquisition officers, senior procurement representatives and agency small business directors throughout the federal government.

Each federal agency is responsible for meeting its respective small business goal, and therefore has an important role to play in helping achieve the government-wide goal.&amp;nbsp; The SBA works closely with the OMB’s Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) to collaborate on important initiatives and develop strategies for maximizing small business participation in federal procurement.

- Small Business Procurement Advisory Council (SBPAC). SBA chairs the SBPAC which includes directors of the Offices of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization.&amp;nbsp; These directors are the advocates for small business within each agency and meet regularly with their procurement offices to encourage the use of small businesses in meeting their agency goals.

- Collaboration with White House and Senior Officials. On a regular basis, the SBA collaborates with the White House and Senior Officials at each agency to ensure agencies&amp;nbsp;are being held accountable for the government-wide small business contracting goal. This unprecedented collaboration has facilitated the sharing of best practices and has ensured top-level leadership commitment from across the federal government.

- Small Business Frontline Advocacy.&amp;nbsp; SBA’s Office of Government Contracting interacts on a daily basis with federal agencies and large prime contractors with subcontracting requirements to ensure that maximum practicable opportunity is being afforded small business concerns. These field agents participate in acquisition strategies of all federal agencies, support market analysis, acquisition structure, subcontracting plan development and execution, and perform compliance reviews of both agency and industry, to ensure that small businesses have the access and information to compete.&amp;nbsp; In addition, they review small business size issues and perform capability assessments of prospective small businesses that may be in line for awards as needed.

- Data Quality Process and the Data Quality Working Group. SBA cannot alter the federal procurement data that has been input into FPDS-NG.&amp;nbsp; However, the Agency continuously takes steps to improve data integrity.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Each federal agency is responsible for ensuring the quality of its own contracting data, but SBA conducts additional analysis to help them identify any potential data anomalies.


	In prior years, SBA provided agencies with individualized reports of anomalies related to their small business contracting data in order to identify any issues prior to SBA’s release of the Small Business Procurement Scorecard.



	The FY 2012 Anomaly process used by SBA focused on a “spot-check” for a selected number of agencies.&amp;nbsp; SBA provided Anomaly Reports to the 10 agencies with the highest FY 2012 anomaly small business eligible dollars.
	In FY 2013, SBA provided reports and training via FPDS-NG reports for agencies to conduct their own anomaly analysis.



	SBA will continue to work with OFPP and&amp;nbsp;the interagency procurement data quality working group to develop a process that will (1) improve efforts to achieve small business goals, (2) reduce burden on the workforce, and (3) improve data quality. &amp;nbsp;As part of its ongoing data quality efforts, the SBA will&amp;nbsp;continue&amp;nbsp;to work with federal agency procurement staff to provide tools to encourage data reviews, improvements to procurement systems and training sessions to improve accuracy.&amp;nbsp; SBA is also recruiting to fill a data quality analyst position to monitor and address small business prime contracting and subcontracting data within SBA and across government-wide data systems.


The SBA programs that contribute to this Agency Priority goal are: Size Standards,&amp;nbsp;Mentor-Protégé, Procurement Assistance, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Procurement,&amp;nbsp;Small Business Procurement Set-Aside, Women-Owned Small Business Federal Contracting, 7(j) Technical Assistance, 8(a) Business Development, HUBZone.

The Office of Communications and Public Liaison (OCPL), the Office of Entrepreneurial Development (OED), and the Office of Field Operations (OFO) will promote SBA’s contracting opportunities to small business owners through comprehensive and coordinated marketing and outreach efforts, including online and in-person workshops and trainings. Additionally, SBA will work with its resource partners (including Women’s Business Centers and Small Business Development Centers) to develop outreach and training initiatives and other tools to help fully deploy the Agency’s national network behind this goal.
