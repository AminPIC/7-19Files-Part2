GSA will also work with agencies to complete a total of 15 Client Portfolio Plans (three new plans each year) to identify opportunities for agencies to optimize their real estate portfolios.

Rents were also optimized in competitive markets to capture favorable tenant lease rates. &amp;nbsp;To date, GSA completed a total of 32 projects that have saved over $61.4 million in annual rent payments and reduced its real estate inventory by approximately 2.3 million usable square feet.


	
	In FY 2015, the CPP program completed three additional portfolio plans and met the cumulative target goal of completing 15 Client Portfolio plans. &amp;nbsp;The three additional plans were for:

	
		
		U.S. Department of Agriculture
		
		
		U.S. Department of Justice
		
		
		U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs
		
	
	



	
	In FY 2015, GSA completed sixteen consolidation and lease opportunities for seven agencies, saving over $30.6 million annually and reducing the footprint by 916,000 usable square feet.
	


&amp;nbsp;

GSA received an appropriation of $140 million for Space Consolidation Activities, for both FY 2014 and FY 2015.


	
	In FY 2014, nine CPP projects leveraged $26.4 million in consolidation funds with a targeted $6.4 million in annual rent savings, a reduction of &amp;nbsp;300,000 usable square feet, and $23 million in annual government leased cost avoidance.
	
	
	In FY 2015, &amp;nbsp;ten CPP projects leveraged $39 million in consolidation funds with a targeted $14.2 million in annual rent savings, a reduction of 400,000 usable square feet , and $18.7 million in annual government leased cost avoidance.
	


&amp;nbsp;

In FY 2014, GSA implemented an internal agency measure to track the reduction of lease space in its inventory. &amp;nbsp;By improving utilization in owned and leased buildings, GSA surpassed its goal of reducing by five percent the amount of space procured through replacement leases. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In FY 2015, through replacement lease projects, GSA had a 24 percent (500,000 square feet) space reduction over the existing leases, far exceeding the Agency Priority Goal of reducing space by five percent for replacement leases.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>GSA will strengthen federal capabilities to leverage the purchasing power of the government to offer the most cost-effective solutions. Two areas of focus will be improving federal utilization of space and increasing savings through strategic sourcing. GSA will continue to promote cost savings through the sustainable usage of space, travel, fleet, technology and resources. GSA will also continue to test new technologies, workplaces, and other solutions, and share the best practices with other agencies to generate savings.

</objective_statement><objective_overview>GSA is leading efforts to improve asset utilization, reduce agency space requirements, effectively manage real property, and pursue innovative proposals to leverage resources. We are a government-wide leader and expert in real estate solutions. We will assist and educate federal departments and agencies to develop plans that will assist agencies with consolidating their space to reduce their footprint.
GSA is encouraging agencies to reduce space to minimize costs. We use a variety of tools, strategies, and portfolio planning options to determine the optimal housing solutions for agencies. We are also targeting our large, more costly new construction, major repairs and alterations, and leasing prospectus projects. By working with customer agencies, GSA will identify opportunities to optimize federal real estate portfolios by reducing space, improving utilization, disposing of underutilized assets, and leveraging market opportunities to reduce the footprint and investment and operating costs.
GSA supports the Office of Management and Budget’s “Freeze the Footprint” policy – aimed at maintaining government-wide square footage for offices and warehouses – by collecting government-wide data and conducting analysis to assess the performance of each agency towards meeting the national goal.
 
Strategies:
Use of the Customer Portfolio Plans process to develop and implement space saving opportunities with demonstrated value for both the client and GSA. These plans create value by proposing solutions which align Administration, Client Agency and GSA goals, and help optimize an agency’s existing portfolio while more effectively anticipating, capturing, and advising on future portfolio needs.
Where it is advantageous to the federal government, work to house tenants in federally owned space, rather than leasing from the private sector.
Minimize the amount of vacant space in the inventory and increase the utilization of existing space.
 
Key Performance Goals:
Reduce the federal footprint
Reduce vacant space in the government-owned and leased inventory
 
Contributing Programs:
Building Operations
Construction and Acquisition of Facilities
Government-wide Policy
Operating Expense
Real Property Disposal
Real Property Relocation
Rental of Space
