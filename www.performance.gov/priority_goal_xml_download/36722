Executive order 13693 mandates a 2.5% annual reduction in facilities energy intensity as measured in British Thermal Units per gross square foot.&amp;nbsp; Improving facility energy performance on DoD installations will lower energy costs, improve mission effectiveness, improve energy resilience, and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

Energy is a fundamental enabler of military capability.&amp;nbsp; In the context of operational missions, understanding the implications of energy use in systems and weapons platforms allows DoD to improve combat effectiveness.&amp;nbsp; Specifically, the Department can assess the energy supportability of systems and concepts through scenario-based analyses that include realistic threats and logistics constraints.&amp;nbsp;

By September 30, 2025, DoD will improve its facility energy performance by reducing average building energy intensity by 25% from the 2015 baseline: 1) By September 30, 2017, the DoD will improve its facility energy performance by reducing average facility energy intensity by 5% from a 2015 baseline.&amp;nbsp; 2)&amp;nbsp; By September 30, 2018, the DoD will improve its facility energy performance by reducing average facility energy intensity by 7.5% from 2015 baseline.&amp;nbsp;

By September 2018, DoD will institutionalize operational energy considerations in the force development process: 1) By September 30, 2016 DoD will ensure all acquisition programs that use operational energy and are designated as Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) Interest Items by the Joint Staff have an Energy Supportability Analysis (ESA)-informed Energy Key Performance Parameter (eKPP); 2) By September 30, 2017, DoD will include operational energy constraints and limitations analyses in all Title 10 war games; and 3) By September 30, 2018, ensure ESAs are used in all acquisition programs that use operational energy and were established in FY 2016 and later.
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Problem / Opportunity:
As the single largest consumer of energy in the nation, accounting for around one percent of national demand, DoD spent approximately $4 billion in FY2014 to power its fixed installations and non-tactical vehicle fleet (installation energy).&amp;nbsp; Operational energy accounts for a substantial portion of DoDs overall consumption – warranting efforts for data accuracy and accountability.

Relationship to Strategic Goal and Objective:
As DoD strives to better support 21st century needs by reforming and reshaping the institution to gain efficiencies and effectiveness, efforts to reduce the nation’s predominant energy consumption and consequential expenditures must remain a Defense priority.

Operational energy is the energy required for training, moving, and sustaining military forces and weapons platforms for military operations.&amp;nbsp; This includes energy used by tactical power systems and generators, as well as by weapons platforms themselves.&amp;nbsp; The DoD considers operational energy to be the energy used in military operations, in direct support of military operations, and in training that supports unit readiness for military operations, to include the energy used at non-enduring locations (contingency bases).

Improving the energy supportability of DoD systems and weapons platforms directly supports the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review statement that “Energy improvements enhance range, endurance, and agility, particularly in the future security environment where logistics may be constrained.”&amp;nbsp; Facility energy improvements support DoD’s Strategic Goal to Reform and Reshape the Defense Institution and Strategic Objective to Achieve efficiencies and effectiveness to redirect resources to direct support of combat, combat support, and combat service support elements of the DoD. Operational energy efforts directly support DoD’s Strategic Goal to Defeat our Adversaries, Deter War, and Defend the Nation.

Key Barriers and Challenges:
Improving facility energy performance depends upon capital investments in energy efficiency programs.&amp;nbsp; Major reductions in the facility energy budget as a result of sequestration during FY 2013 and FY 2014 will make it very difficult for the Department to meet mandated facility energy goals.

To improve decision making related to operational energy, DoD needs reliable and detailed data on energy consumption.&amp;nbsp; Current methods for measuring operational energy consumption typically do not include information on end use, limiting DoD’s ability to inform planning, programming, and operational decisions.&amp;nbsp;

Successfully institutionalizing energy supportability analyses in DoD force development is dependent on widespread adoption and understanding of the value of Energy Supportability Analyses (ESAs) as well as the consistent application of realistic threats and limited logistics capacity in our force development planning. Improved capabilities (e.g., increased range, improved force protection, etc.) are often inseparable from increased energy demand.&amp;nbsp; Addressing that increased energy demand through adaptations in the Department’s use of energy often come at the expense of significant funding gaps, as modifications, upgrades, or other design changes are expensive to implement.

Mitigation Efforts:&amp;nbsp;
The DoD will continue to pursue opportunities to use third-party financing through performance based energy savings contracts.&amp;nbsp; DoD has a commitment to execute nearly $2.1 billion in third-party financed performance-based contracts (Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPC) and Utility Energy Service Contracts (UESC)) by the end of CY2016, in response to the President’s December. 2, 2011 commitment.&amp;nbsp; To date, DoD has awarded $1.05 billion in performance based energy contracts.

Additionally, improved estimate efforts on end use consumption of operational energy will better inform DoD with a credible baseline.

The ECIP funds energy conservation and small scale renewable energy projects to improve DoD energy performance. During each fiscal year of the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP), DoD executes the $150 million ECIP in the following manner:

• Select ECIP projects to be funded in the next fiscal year (FY18 Q1)
• Receive ECIP funding through the Defense Appropriations Bill for current fiscal year (FY17 Q1/Q2)
• Distribute ECIP funds and execute selected projects for current fiscal year (FY17 Q2/Q3/Q4)

The process for identifying, publishing and executing ECIP projects is as follows:

• Components identify facilities energy conservation projects next fiscal year (Q1)
• OSD down selects projects to be funded for next fiscal year based on savings to investment ratio analysis (Q1)
• ECIP list for the next fiscal year is published with the President's Budget (Q2)
• Defense Appropriations Bill provides funding for current fiscal year (Q1 or Q2)
• OSD notifies Congress of ECIP program project list for current fiscal year and distributes ECIP funding (Q2)
• OSD allocates funds to Components for current fiscal year approved projects (~ 2 months after passage of the Defense Appropriations Bill)
• Components execute current fiscal year projects after receipt of funds (Q2-Q4)

Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPC) are an alternative financing mechanism authorized by Congress designed to accelerate investment in cost effective energy conservation measures in existing Federal buildings. ESPCs allow Federal agencies to accomplish energy savings projects without up-front capital costs and without special Congressional appropriations. DoD has a commitment to execute nearly $2.183 billion of the President's $4 billion ESPC goal. DoD will award Energy Savings Performance Contracts as energy conservation measures are identified through third-party audits.&amp;nbsp; As of August 15, 2016 DoD Components have awarded 163 projects at a value of $1,562M towards the President’s Performance Contracting Challenge goal.

&amp;nbsp;
</next_steps><progress_update>In 2015, the Department made progress towards reducing its installation energy intensity relative to a FY2003 baseline (-19.9%).&amp;nbsp; In FY2016 Q1-Q2, DoD held Program Reviews with each of the Military Services and analyzed their proposed energy budgets and energy programs to ensure they were on track to meet energy goals. In FY2016 Q1, DoD received appropriations and began the process for executing energy conservation projects.

DoD continues to execute energy conservation investments in the Military Services' Operations and Maintenance accounts; and installation energy conservation projects through the Energy Conservation Investment Program. FY2016 ECIP projects have been selected and funds should be distributed soon to the Services for project execution. Further, DoD remains committed to reducing energy use through third-party financed contract vehicles like Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPC) and Utility Energy Service Contracts (UESC). Since the beginning of the President's Performance Contract Challenge in December 2011, more than $1.540 billion in ESPCs and UESCs have been awarded, with an additional $2.28 billion in the pipeline.

The Department is committed to improving energy performance.&amp;nbsp; The&amp;nbsp; Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and Environment, in coordination with the Military Departments and Defense Agencies/Field Activities, publishes comprehensive plans and reports regarding energy activities, performance, and strategies across the Department.&amp;nbsp; This information can be found at: http://www.acq.osd.mil/eie/
</progress_update><themes><theme>Energy</theme></themes><contributing_programs_and_other_factors>Installation Energy Testbed Program: The Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Energy, Installations and Environment) Science and Technology is leveraging advanced technology through the installation energy testbed as a cost-effective way to demonstrate and validate emerging energy technologies in a real-world environment.&amp;nbsp; Projects conduct rigorous operational testing and assessment of the life-cycle costs of new technology while addressing DoD-unique issues.&amp;nbsp; Following demonstrations, the DoD can be a sophisticated first user of successful cutting-edge, transformational energy technologies.

Institutionalizing operational energy in the force development process Initiative will rely on contributions from:

(1) The Services through capability gap assessments and the identification of energy implications of mitigation strategies, as well as through their oversight of Title 10 wargames; and (2) The Joint Staff through the oversight of requirements in the Joint Capabilities Integration Development System (JCIDS).

Partners (Agency Internal and External):
DoD relies on third-party investors to increase facility energy performance. These partnerships allow DoD to continue energy efficiency programs without using taxpayer dollars. DoD has a commitment to execute nearly $2.1 billion in third-party financed performance-based contracts (Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPC) and Utility Energy Service Contracts UESC)) by the end of CY 2016, in response to President's December 2, 2011, commitment.&amp;nbsp; To date, DoD has awarded $1.05 billion in performance based energy contracts.

For operational energy, the Defense Operational Energy Board (DOEB) along with a supporting Deputies group, both composed of representatives from Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Joint Staff, Defense Agencies, Services, and Combatant Commands, has met routinely since 2012 to discuss the role of operational energy in force development.&amp;nbsp; This engagement, along with specific working groups, informed the development of this performance goal.
