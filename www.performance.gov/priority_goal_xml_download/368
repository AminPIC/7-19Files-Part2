</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Salmonella is the leading known cause of bacterial foodborne illness and death in the United States. Each year in the United States, Salmonella causes an estimated 1.2 million illnesses, including fever and diarrhea, and between 400 and 500 deaths. Salmonella serotype Enteritidis (SE), a subtype of Salmonella, is now the most common type of Salmonella in the United States and accounts for approximately 20% of all Salmonella cases in humans. The most significant sources of foodborne SE infections are shell eggs (FDA-regulated) and broiler chickens (USDA-regulated). Therefore, reducing SE illness from shell eggs is the most appropriate FDA strategy for reducing illness from SE. Preventing Salmonella infections depends on actions taken by regulatory agencies, the food industry and consumers to reduce contamination of food, as well as actions taken for detecting and responding to outbreaks. As part of the shared vision to reduce foodborne illness, HHS's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has developed a Priority Goal to reduce Salmonella contamination in shell eggs, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is working with FDA to gather more data to better estimate sources of illness. Additionally, USDA, FDA and CDC are involved in many interagency efforts, including the Interagency Food Safety Analytics Collaboration (IFSAC). This interagency collaboration is working to improve methods used to estimate the proportion of foodborne illnesses associated with specific sources.

FDA drafted and published on the FDA website a guidance for industry to aid them in complying with the rule.&amp;nbsp; FDA trained&amp;nbsp;FDA and state investigators on inspecting for compliance with the&amp;nbsp;rule in 2010.&amp;nbsp; Inspections began in 2010 and will continue to provide assurance that the industry remains in compliance.

Since FY 2010, FDA has conducted over 1100 inspections of large and small egg producers. &amp;nbsp;In November, FDA issued the new assignment to continue inspections of small and large egg producers for FY 2015. As of September 30, 2015, FDA has conducted a total of 136 inspections or investigations. The emergence of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) at commercial egg producing operations impacts FDA’s ability to monitor compliance with the Egg Rule. On May 5, 2015, FDA temporarily suspended physical inspections of egg laying facilities to safeguard against possible spread of HPAI.&amp;nbsp; The FDA is working closely with USDA and other federal, state and local agencies to track and manage the effects of recent outbreaks of HPAI. Prior to resuming inspection, the Agency will be providing enhanced biosecurity training to all food safety staff in FDA and States performing inspections on egg farms.

For CDC, the work to attribute the SE illnesses to shell eggs is an important part of the strategy. Historically, SE illnesses in humans have been linked to shell eggs, poultry meat, raw milk, pork, beef, sprouts, raw almonds, contact with reptiles, and other sources. It is necessary to know the major sources of SE illness so that the regulatory agencies know what foods to target in their contamination reduction efforts, and can assess the effect of their efforts. The particular food responsible for a person’s illness is typically only known in outbreaks, and fewer than five percent of illnesses are part of recognized outbreaks. Source attribution analyses use statistical modeling approaches that use the limited data that is available to estimate the sources of SE infections across the whole population. CDC, in partnership with the Interagency Food Safety Analytics Collaboration (IFSAC), estimated the proportion of SE foodborne illnesses attributable to shell eggs by using a mathematical “exposure” model that incorporated data from foodborne disease outbreak investigations and from a case-control study of sporadic (non-outbreak) illnesses. This model was used to estimate the proportion of foodborne and total SE illnesses attributable to shell eggs during 2007-2009.

To estimate source attribution for more recent years, the model needs to be updated with more recent data.

All 10 FoodNet sites are transmitting exposure information to CDC. Information about the exposures of 979 people with domestically-acquired, sporadic SE illness in 2013 and 2014 has been mapped to exposures included in the attribution model and has been evaluated for quality. Information on an additional 373 SE sporadic illnesses collected as of June 2015 is being reviewed and will be added to future analyses. A project proposal of the Interagency Food Safety Analytics Collaboration (IFSAC) includes work to explore how to use both the new exposure information and whole genome sequence data (collected through FDA Genome Trakr network) in the model. The IFSAC Steering Committee approved the project plan in September 2015

CDC is working with FDA to obtain data suitable for a “food product” model used in other countries to link contamination rates in foods to illness incidence.

In January 2015, the FDA CDC workgroup met in Washington DC to review data that FDA collected during the FY 2013 and FY 2014 inspection assignments and to discuss strategies to enhance data collection. The focus of the discussion was 1) data FDA might collect on SE contamination of shell eggs by doing a survey that includes microbiologic testing of shell eggs, 2) data FDA might collect during egg farm inspections in FY 2016 that could be used in attribution analyses, and 3) determining approaches to analyze whole genome sequence data from SE isolates obtained from contaminated food products and ill persons and using this information to identify genomic profiles to determine the likely sources of SE isolates obtained from ill people. Based on these discussions, the IFSAC project plan &amp;nbsp;approved in September 2015 includes analysis of whole genome sequence data.

CDC reported that the illness rate during the 12-month period ending June 30, 2015 was 2.9 illnesses per 100,000. This is a decrease from the 2010 rate (3.5 cases per 100,000) but is higher than the 2007-2009 baseline rate of 2.6 cases per 100,000 population.

Next Steps:


	Continue inspections of small and large egg producers.
	FDA and CDC will continue to evaluate whether representative data can be obtained securely from egg-producing farms to use in the “food product” model.
	The FDA CDC workgroup will plan to schedule a meeting to occur no later than January 2016 to revisit and discuss sampling strategies for data collection, to assure progress on data sharing, and to identify and remove any obstacles to achieving goals.
	CDC plans to update the current SE exposure model with new data as it becomes available.

Foods Program

The mission of the Foods Program is to protect and promote the health of humans and animals by ensuring the safety of the American food supply, animal feed and cosmetics, as well as the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs and devices. Outbreaks of foodborne illness and contamination events have a substantial impact on public health – an estimated 48 million foodborne illnesses occur every year resulting in an estimated 128,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 deaths.

Congress recognized the unique challenges faced by FDA in the area of food safety in the 21st century, and gave the Agency a modern legislative mandate to meet these challenges by enacting the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011 (FSMA).&amp;nbsp; FSMA directs FDA to build a food safety system based on the public health principle of comprehensive prevention, an enhanced focus on risk‐based resource allocation, and partnership across the public and private sectors to minimize hazards from farm to table.

The Foods Program focuses on securing high rates of compliance with science-based food safety and labeling standards by implementing integrated, prevention-oriented, and risk-based programs to protect the safety and security of foods and cosmetics and to ensure that food labels contain useful and reliable information.

FDA Headquarters and Program Support

FDA Headquarters (HQ) provides Agency-wide program direction and administrative services to ensure that FDA's consumer and patient safety programs are effectively and efficiently managed. Below are the seven primary HQ components responsible for providing Agency-level oversight and advice to FDA leadership and programs:&amp;nbsp; Office of the Commissioner, Office of Chief Counsel, Office of the Chief Scientist, Office of Operations, Office of Foods and Veterinary Medicine, Office of Medical Products and Tobacco, and Office of Global Regulatory Operations and Policy.

Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases

The Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases program aims to prevent disease, disability, and death caused by a wide range of infectious diseases. The program focuses on diseases that have been around for many years, emerging diseases (those that are new or just recently identified), and zoonotic diseases (those spread from animals to people). The program’s work is guided in part by a holistic &quot;One Health&quot; strategy, which recognizes the vital interconnectedness of microbes and the environment.

To carry out this mission, the program uses many different tactics:&amp;nbsp; providing leadership in public health, conducting exemplary science, strengthening preparedness efforts, establishing public health policy, sharing vital health information with the public, and building partnerships.
