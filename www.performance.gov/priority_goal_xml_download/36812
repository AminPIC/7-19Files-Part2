&amp;nbsp;

***This is a tentative target. OSHA expects two rulemakings to affect the number of hazards abated related to falls in FY 2016 – the final rule on Occupational Injury and Illness Recording and Reporting Requirements—Northern American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Update and Reporting Revisions, issued in September 2014, and the forthcoming final rule on Walking and Working Surfaces and Personal Protective Equipment (Fall Protection Systems).&amp;nbsp; OSHA will continue to analyze data related to this measure and may revise the target based on the results of the analysis.

&amp;nbsp;
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Each year, thousands of workers are killed and millions are injured or made ill on the job due to unsafe and unhealthy working conditions.[1] Department of Labor (DOL) agencies charged with improving workplace safety and health will use rigorous enforcement, science-based rulemaking, and stakeholder involvement to achieve this crucial strategic goal.

All workers have a right to a safe and healthful work environment.&amp;nbsp; The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) conduct inspections and outreach in high-risk areas, and complete mandated enforcement activities.&amp;nbsp; DOL expects these activities to have the greatest effect on overall compliance and the ultimate reduction in workplace injuries, fatalities and illnesses.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, the Department will continue its commitment to the Agency Priority Goal of reducing injuries, illnesses and fatalities.

</next_steps><progress_update>Fall protection continues to be the number one violation cited by OSHA. Falls are also the leading cause of death in the construction industry and account for 20 percent&amp;nbsp;of all serious injuries. OSHA has national and local emphasis plans (NEPs and LEPs), as well as a Strategic Plan that directs Compliance Officers (CSHOs) to those establishments with the most significant risk of fall hazards. This level of attention and proactive enforcement will directly impact the workers at these establishments by requiring abatement.&amp;nbsp; More generally, this enforcement activity will alert and educate other employers about fall hazards in the industries affected and in the local areas. It will also serve to incentivize employers to proactively assess and address fall hazards in order to avoid enforcement actions.

OSHA will also address establishments and corporations which have been shown to have serious fall hazards and react with callous indifference to serious fall hazards. OSHA has several programs which can be applied to achieve positive outcomes in these situations. These programs include the Severe Violators Enforcement Program and the Corporate-Wide Settlement Agreement program.

Since October 2015, nine fatalities and more than 1,100 nonfatal accidents have occurred in the nation’s coal mines, resulting in restricted duty, missed days at work, and permanent disabilities for the miners who worked there.&amp;nbsp; While injury rates have been fairly consistent during this time period, records indicate a trend in accidents resulting in more serious injuries. The circumstances in at least 30 of the accidents might have led to fatalities.&amp;nbsp; On August 29, 2016, MSHA implemented a call to safety to all coal miners, both underground and surface. &amp;nbsp;Inspectors engaged coal miners and mine operators in “walk and talks” through September 30, reminding them to “stop and take a breath” before proceeding with the next task at hand.&amp;nbsp;

MSHA continues to focus on three significant final rules.&amp;nbsp; MSHA is working on a final rule to require underground coal operators to equip coal hauling machines and scoops with proximity detection systems that provide a warning and stop mobile machines before a pinning, crushing, or striking accident occurs that could result in injury or death to miners.&amp;nbsp; MSHA is developing a final rule on Examinations of Working Places in Metal and Nonmetal Mines.&amp;nbsp; MSHA is developing a proposed rule on respirable crystalline silica in metal and nonmetal mines.&amp;nbsp;

The Funding Opportunity Announcement for the Fiscal Year 2016 Brookwood-Sago Grant closed on September 9, 2016.&amp;nbsp; Grant recipients are scheduled to be announced in early FY 2017.&amp;nbsp; The purpose of these grants is to provide training to improve and secure safe and healthy workplaces for U.S. miners.&amp;nbsp;Click here for more information on the Brookwood-Sago Mine Safety Grants&amp;nbsp;program.

MSHA continues to use improved practices begun after the UBB disaster to address noncompliance. MSHA's Impact Inspection program, targeting specific mines with compliance problems, is an important tool in agency enforcement efforts. &amp;nbsp;Many of the inspections conducted under this program identified and cited previously concealed hazards and focused on poor compliance history or particular compliance concerns. &amp;nbsp; Evidence indicates this approach is working. &amp;nbsp;From April 2010 through September&amp;nbsp;2016, MSHA conducted 1,123&amp;nbsp;impact inspections and issued 16,841 citations, 1,324 orders and 61 safeguards.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A review of mines that received impact inspections since April 2010 shows that overall compliance is improving at these mines. &amp;nbsp;These enforcement efforts along with&amp;nbsp;MSHA's other initiatives such as the &quot;Rules to Live By,&quot; have significantly impacted the top mining industry violators. Moreover, the number of significant and substantial (S&amp;amp;S) violations dropped 39&amp;nbsp;percent at the top 200 mines nationally since the 2010 POV reforms were put in place. &amp;nbsp;

Efforts to lower levels of respirable coal mine dust and silica in the nation’s coal mines remain on track. &amp;nbsp;Since the 2009 launch of the “End Black Lung – Act Now” campaign, average respirable dust levels have decreased annually. &amp;nbsp;Dust sampling results for FY 2016, collected under the respirable coal dust rule that went into effect in August 2014, dropped to historic lows. &amp;nbsp;

Metal and Nonmetal and EPD continue to work on training and assistance activities to prepare the mining industry for full implementation of the Mine Act compliance in U.S. Territories - Guam, American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. &amp;nbsp;MSHA has established a Cooperative Agreement with each Territory, which will provide grant funding for training and education programs for miners.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

</objective_statement><objective_overview>In the wealthiest Nation on earth, no mother or father should have to die for a paycheck. America’s working men and women deserve the opportunity to provide for their families without unnecessary risk to their health, safety, and livelihood. The Labor Department both promotes and protects the opportunity that has made America the country it is today, and American families are safer, more secure, and more prosperous because of it.
All workers have a right to a safe and healthful work environment. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) recognize that some workers are more vulnerable than others and that some workplaces are more hazardous than others. By strategically scheduling inspections and outreach in high-risk areas, in addition to completing mandated enforcement activity, DOL expects to have the greatest effect on overall compliance. With more employers in compliance, workplace injuries, fatalities, and illnesses should decline – the ultimate outcome for DOL and American workers and a critical component of the Secretary’s vision.
