</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Smoking and second hand smoke is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States, killing more than an estimated 480,000 people in the U.S. each year.&amp;nbsp; For every smoker who dies from a smoking-attributable disease, another 30 live with a serious smoking-related disease.&amp;nbsp; Smoking costs the U.S. more than $300 billion a year, including nearly $170 billion in direct medical costs, and more than $156 billion in lost productivity.&amp;nbsp; An estimated 58 million nonsmoking Americans are exposed to secondhand smoke, which causes more than 41,000 deaths in non-smoking adults each year .&amp;nbsp; While smoking among U.S. adults is down significantly from a decade ago, the decline in adult smoking rates has slowed, concurrent with reductions in state investments in tobacco control program.&amp;nbsp; Fortunately, people who stop smoking greatly reduce their risk for disease and premature death. Smoking cessation lowers the risk for lung and other types of cancer; it reduces the risk for coronary heart disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease.&amp;nbsp; .&amp;nbsp;

In 2010, HHS issued Ending the Epidemic – A Tobacco Control Strategic Action Plan, outlining a set of comprehensive actions framed around four key Healthy People 2020 tobacco control objectives:
1)&amp;nbsp;reduce tobacco use
2)&amp;nbsp;reduce the initiation of tobacco use
3)&amp;nbsp;increase successful cessation attempts by smokers
4)&amp;nbsp;reduce the proportion of nonsmokers exposed to secondhand smoke.

The National Prevention Strategy, released in 2011, includes tobacco control as one of seven priorities across the U.S. Government.

In 2012, cigarette and smokeless tobacco companies spent more than $9.6 billion, more than $1 million per hour that year, on advertising and promotional expenses in the United States to attract new users, retain current users, increase consumption, and generate favorable attitudes toward smoking.&amp;nbsp; There is also a growing concern regarding new tobacco products that are being marketed to smokers as alternatives for use in smoke-free environments.&amp;nbsp; Dual use of cigarettes and other tobacco products can maintain tobacco addiction and use among smokers who might otherwise quit.&amp;nbsp; The marketing of purported reduced-risk products may increase overall tobacco use. Consumer mistaken perceptions of the “safety” of these products may pose a continuing obstacle for tobacco control.

States continue to reduce funding for comprehensive tobacco control. Research has shown that progress to prevent initiation and promote cessation in comprehensive programs is reversed when funding is no longer sustained.&amp;nbsp;

HHS engages with multiple stakeholders in implementing tobacco control activities, which include: Congress, the public, minority communities, groups affected by tobacco-related health disparities, state and local tobacco control officials, tobacco control and public health non-governmental organizations, the scientific &amp;amp; research community, and businesses.

The U.S. Congress has provided direction and support for tobacco control activities in the following legislative actions:
•&amp;nbsp;The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
•&amp;nbsp;The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA)
•&amp;nbsp;The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (FSPTCA)
•&amp;nbsp;The Children’s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA)

HHS oversees tobacco control and prevention committees covered by the Federal Advisory Committee Act. All meetings of these committees are open to the public and offer opportunities for stakeholder feedback.

The FY14 results of other combustible tobacco use indicators are tracking lower usage across both adults and youth:
•&amp;nbsp;Percentage of adult smokers&amp;nbsp; - 16.8%; exceeding the FY14 target of 18% (National Health Interview Survey)
•&amp;nbsp;Percentage of adult smokers last smoked 6 months to 1 year ago – 7.6%; exceeding the FY14 target of 7.2% (National Health Interview Survey)
•&amp;nbsp;Percentage of children/adolescents initiation – 4.3%; exceeding the FY14 target of 4.7% (National Survey on Drug Use and Health)
•&amp;nbsp;Percentage of young adults initiation – 6.6%; exceeding the FY14 target of 7.5% (National Survey on Drug Use and Health)

These significant trends with the continued plans of the Department to address combustible tobacco use make the continuation of the APG into FY16-FY17 highly achievable.&amp;nbsp;

Recent Accomplishments:
•&amp;nbsp;OASH/OSG – As of July 2015, the Tobacco-Free College Campus Initiative (TFCCI):
o&amp;nbsp;1,577 smoke-free campuses, of which 1,078 were fully tobacco-free
o&amp;nbsp;95% increase in college and university campuses in the U.S. that have adopted comprehensive smoke-free policies since TFCCI's launch in September 2012
o&amp;nbsp;710 campuses now prohibit the use of e-cigarettes anywhere on campus
•&amp;nbsp;CDC&amp;nbsp; - Continued to build state health department infrastructure and capacity to implement comprehensive tobacco control programs by awarding National Tobacco Control Program grantees through a five-year cooperative agreement.
•&amp;nbsp;CDC – Conducted the fourth national tobacco education campaign, which generated approximately 62.7% additional calls to 1-800-QUIT-NOW, garnered over 1.5 billion audience impressions, and approximately $860,000 in ad value.
o&amp;nbsp;Conducted the first pilot of Quitline nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) distribution tied to Tips, which will inform a time-limited nationwide NRT promotion in the 2016 campaign.
•&amp;nbsp;CDC – Released data highlighting critical trends in youth use of e-cigarettes and flavored tobacco products, which together garnered almost 3.7 billion audience impressions and a publicity value of more than $4.2 million.

</progress_update><themes><theme>Health</theme></themes><contributing_programs_and_other_factors>The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, HHS (OASH) The OASH under the leadership of the Assistant Secretary for Health, coordinates all tobacco control activities for the Department and has lead responsibility for accomplishment of this goal. The Assistant Secretary for Health directed the development of the HHS Strategic Plan on Tobacco Control and chairs the HHS Tobacco Control Implementation Committee.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) CDC’s Center for Chronic Disease and Public Health Promotion provides national leadership for a comprehensive, broad-based approach to reducing tobacco use. Essential elements of this approach include state-based, community-based, and health system-based interventions; cessation services; countermarketing; policy development and implementation; tobacco product research; surveillance; and evaluation.

The Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Tobacco Products (CTP) &amp;nbsp;FDA is responsible for implementing the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control Act), which gives the agency authority to regulate the manufacture, marketing, and distribution of tobacco products as provided by statute and as appropriate for the protection of public health. Some of the agency’s responsibilities under the law include setting tobacco product standards, reviewing premarket applications for new and modified-risk tobacco products, requiring new health warnings, and estab­lishing and enforcing advertising and promotion restrictions.

The National Institute of Health’s Tobacco Control Research Branch (TCRB) NIH has identified research to prevent and control tobacco use and tobacco-related cancers as a public health priority. The Tobacco Control Research Branch (TCRB) leads and collaborates on research and disseminates evidence-based findings to prevent, treat, and control tobacco use. Branch activities include funding research grants and contracts, sponsoring conferences and symposia, and disseminating tobacco control science. Additionally, experts conduct research and partici­pate in diverse scientific and programmatic activities in support of national and international tobacco control efforts.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) CMS provides coverage of smoking and tobacco cessation counseling for certain beneficiaries. Through Medicare, all beneficiaries who use tobacco are covered.&amp;nbsp; Tobacco cessation counseling and likewise the provision of tobacco cessation pharmaceuticals are optional benefits under Medicaid for all individuals should the state elect to provide them. As of 10/1/10, Medicaid requires states to provide those services to pregnant women.

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) SAMHSA supports a variety of tobacco prevention and treatment activities. Prevention activities include enforcement of the Synar Amendment, which focuses on reducing the sale of tobacco products to minors, and funding grants to States and communities focused on the prevention of substance use, including tobacco use. Treatment activities include creating partnerships to implement or enhance current tobacco cessation programs in behavioral health care settings and collaborating with States on the treatment of tobacco dependence in substance abuse and mental health treatment programs.

The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) HRSA’s Health Center Program addresses tobacco use through education, counseling and treatment, aligning with the Healthy People 2020 framework for ending the tobacco use epidemic by supporting tobacco use prevention efforts and helping tobacco users quit.&amp;nbsp; The Health Center Program monitors these efforts by tracking the percentage of patients who are screened for tobacco use and provided appropriate cessation counseling or medication if needed.

The Indian Health Service (IHS) The IHS Cancer Program seeks to reduce tobacco use by promoting clinical cessation efforts, encouraging community-based education and policy interventions, and providing technical assistance to existing surveillance efforts for Indian Health Service, Tribal health programs, and urban Indian health programs.
