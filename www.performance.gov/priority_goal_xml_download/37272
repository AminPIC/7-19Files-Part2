By September 30, 2017, increase the number of registered apprentices from 450,000 as of September, 2015,&amp;nbsp;to 600,000.
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>In 2014, President Obama challenged our nation to expand ApprenticeshipUSA, a way for companies to showcase their current work-based learning programs that meet industry and national standards for registration, and double the number of apprentices in the U.S. over the next five years.&amp;nbsp; To support this challenge, the President announced new federal investments using existing funds to support job-driven Registered Apprenticeships through the American Apprenticeship Initiative.&amp;nbsp; While significant progress has been made, we must add another 250,000 apprenticeships over the next two years to reach this goal.&amp;nbsp;

Registered Apprenticeship programs offer workers a way to start new careers with good wages and are a proven gateway to the middleclass. Workforce organizations, community colleges, and other education and training institutions must work with employers to develop this earn-while-you-learn employment and training strategy.&amp;nbsp; According to DOL data, graduates of Registered Apprenticeship programs earn an average of $60,000 a year and over 8 in 10 graduates retain their employment 9 months after exiting their apprenticeship training.[1]&amp;nbsp; Every federal dollar spent on apprenticeship has yielded roughly $27, a significant return on federal investment.[2]&amp;nbsp;

Building on historic bipartisan support from Congress and leadership across a broad range of states and industry partners, DOL has awarded nearly $90 million in funding appropriated for the&amp;nbsp;ApprenticeshipUSA&amp;nbsp;program to further the goal to double and diversify Registered&amp;nbsp;Apprenticeships by 2019. &amp;nbsp;The $90 million consists of strategic investments to accelerate and expand state apprenticeship strategies and grow the use of apprenticeships in new industries while ensuring that these profound educational and economic opportunities are within reach for more Americans. These new investments are the result of a bipartisan agreement to provide the first-ever programmatic funding for Registered Apprenticeship through the Fiscal Year 2016 spending bill.

			The ETA Office of Apprenticeship will:

			
				Provide oversight to ensure the new programmatic funding stream expands, diversifies, and strengthens the national apprenticeship system while also aligning state and Federal apprenticeship systems with workforce and education. (FY 2017)
				Complete the migrate to a new case management system to further streamline the program registration process, improve the tracking of apprentices, and facilitate better data collection and analysis for the entire national apprenticeship system. (FY 2017)
				Expand the occupational clearinghouse to efficiently increase apprenticeships in non-traditional industries and promote innovative new models including competency based and&amp;nbsp;hybrid programs. (FY 2017)
				Provide ongoing technical assistance to increase the participation of apprenticeship program sponsors on state eligible training provider lists (ETPL) and Workforce Investment Boards (WIBs). (FY 2017)
				Ensure that more women, youth, and under-represented populations participate in registered apprenticeship program by publishing and implementing a Final Rule to modernize the program’s EEO regulations (29 CFR Part 30) to align them with today’s employment practices that protect people with disabilities, older workers, worker’s sexual orientation and other discriminatory factors. (FY 2017) &amp;nbsp;
				Increase state and national ApprenticeshipUSA outreach and communication including the second annual National Apprenticeship Week. (FY 2017)

</next_steps><progress_update>Fourth quarter highlights include:


	Increasing the size of the national Registered Apprenticeship system by 130,000 active apprentices compared to when ETA&amp;nbsp;began the effort to double the number of active apprentices in FY 2014 (from 375,425 to 505,371 apprentices).&amp;nbsp;This includes registering over 574,000 new apprentices and supporting completion of&amp;nbsp;over 146,000 apprentices nationwide during this three year timeframe.
	Awarding $50.5 million in grants to help states develop and implement comprehensive strategies to support apprenticeship expansion. &amp;nbsp;The grants are intended to engage industry and workforce intermediaries, employers, and other partners to expand and market apprenticeship to new sectors and underserved populations; enhance state capacity to conduct outreach and work with employers to start new programs; and expand and diversify participation in apprenticeship through state innovations, incentives, and system reforms. &amp;nbsp;Grants were awarded to 37 successful state applicants with grant awards&amp;nbsp;ranging from $700,000 to $2,700,000.
	Issuing $20.4 million in contract to 10 national industry intermediaries and 4 national equity partners to expand apprenticeship opportunities across the U.S.&amp;nbsp; The national equity partnerships will increase gender, racial, ethnic and other demographic diversity and inclusion in apprenticeships, among traditionally underrepresented populations. These contracts focus specifically on increasing apprenticeship opportunities for women, people of color, opportunity youth, people with disabilities, among other underserved populations.
