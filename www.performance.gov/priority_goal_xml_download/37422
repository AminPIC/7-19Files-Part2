Whether it’s buying office supplies, electric vehicles, or complex information technology solutions, FAS gets them at a discounted price and delivers the savings back to our customer agencies. FAS &amp;nbsp;has developed defined methodologies for quantifying savings for the myriad of products and services offered to customer agencies.&amp;nbsp; The methodologies can generally be grouped into the following categories:

• Savings realized by utilizing FAS procurement vehicles compared to what is available commercially

• Savings realized by using FAS offerings compared to other government offerings

• Savings returned to customers via bank refunds given for using FAS purchase, travel, and fleet cards
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Federal Agencies operate in a constrained budget environment and seek to maximize the use of each budgeted dollar. &amp;nbsp;Through using FAS solutions Federal Agencies are able to purchase the goods and services needed to execute their mission at reduced cost, and&amp;nbsp;as a result are able to maximize the support provided to key mission critical activities. &amp;nbsp;Additional savings are generated for agencies by FAS through expanding the use of strategic buying leveraging FAS offerings across a wider customer base and through the development of new solutions. &amp;nbsp;
</APG_Overview><Goal_Leaders><Goal_Leader><goal_leader_name>Thomas Sharpe</goal_leader_name><goal_leader_title>Commissioner - Federal Acquisition Services</goal_leader_title><goal_leader_org>Federal Acquisition Services (FAS)</goal_leader_org></Goal_Leader></Goal_Leaders><next_steps>Current saving initiatives include strategic sourcing of common supplies, reverse auctions, travel (transportation and hotels), fleet leasing and automotive purchasing.&amp;nbsp; For the majority of these programs, the milestones for the coming quarters will be to increase overall savings through bringing spend under these solutions from offerings in other government programs that do not have commensurate savings.
</next_steps><progress_update>Through Q4, FAS has achieved $6.00B (excluding SmartBUY and FedRooms - where only data through Q3 has been reported) in savings, compared to the $5.20B annual goal.&amp;nbsp; Of the 18 FAS programs covered by the APG, 12 have achieved their FY16 targets with a 13th (WAN) finishing the year within one percent of their target.

&amp;nbsp;

The largest contributing program to this goal, the City Pair Program (CPP), continued to carry FAS toward its savings goal.&amp;nbsp; As government travelers have continued to utilize the CPP and their deeply discounted rates, the commensurate savings has contributed $2.46B toward the overall $5.20B goal.

&amp;nbsp;

Due to an unexpected and significant discount offered by a major software provider, the SmartBUY program realized a $900M incremental savings increase that has been allocated to Q3 results.&amp;nbsp; The software vendor deeply discounted products to DoD customers, which was seen as anomaly and is not anticipated to occur in the future.&amp;nbsp; In turn, the large windfall of additional savings for this particular program helped to ensure FAS exceeded the FY16 savings goal of $5.20B.

&amp;nbsp;

Not all programs were able to achieve their FY16 targets.&amp;nbsp; JanSan has continued to fall short of spend and savings targets as a result of delayed posting on DoD e-Mall, lack of new commitments from Category Management Leadership Council agencies and some products remain embedded in service contracts, hindering JanSan’s results.

Reverse Auctions (RA) continued to struggle to achieve their FY16 target through Q4.&amp;nbsp; This was a result of less than anticipated usage of the RA platform coupled with more accurate independent government estimates (IGEs).&amp;nbsp; Previously, IGEs were much higher than the RA award price, resulting in higher savings figures reported for auctions. As FAS continues to collect and share RA prices paid data with agencies in accordance with category management principles, buyers are expected to develop better IGEs (more closely aligned to RA award prices) resulting in lesser savings.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
