</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Background:

Reducing roadway fatalities continues to be a top priority at the Department of Transportation (DOT).&amp;nbsp; Roadway crashes are among the leading causes of death in the United States, especially among young people.&amp;nbsp;Over the past 10 years, there has been a 25 percent reduction in the number of fatalities on the Nation’s roadways. In 2014, there were a projected 32,675 motor vehicle fatalities. This decline in fatalities shows a continuation in the general trend downward in fatalities that started in 2006. &amp;nbsp;In fact, the projected 2014 fatality rate of 1.08 per 100 vehicle million miles traveled (VMT) is the lowest ever recorded.

The importance of improving transportation safety is reflected in DOT’s Strategic Plan. The Department strives to make the U.S. transportation system the safest in the world. DOT will work with all of its stakeholders — transportation agencies, elected officials, law enforcement, industry, safety advocates, novice drivers, the disability and older adult communities, and the public — to reduce transportation-related fatalities and injuries and make our roadway system safe for all users.

Progress toward a national roadway safety goal requires collaboration with a diverse group of stakeholders and partners across a range of disciplines.&amp;nbsp; Within DOT, the relevant operating administrations can leverage the respective resources and expertise to more effectively achieve a safer transportation environment. These organizations include the following:


	Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) provides Federal State and local partners the tools, resources, and information necessary to make sound safety investment decisions and coordinates with States to develop Strategic Highway Safety Plans (SHSP) and implement programs that improve the safety of roadway infrastructure on all public roads.
	Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) promotes safe commercial motor vehicle (CMV) (large truck and bus) operations through education, innovation, regulation, enforcement, financial assistance, partnerships, and full accountability to reduce crashes, injuries, and fatalities on our Nation’s roadways involving CMVs.
	National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) develops vehicle safety standards, conducts&amp;nbsp;research on new vehicle safety and technology, and oversees compliance, defect investigations and recalls. &amp;nbsp;NHTSA equally focuses on driver behavior by developing effective traffic safety programs, providing grant funds to States to implement these programs, and implementing national high visibility enforcement campaigns.


Roadway fatalities impact all road users, including drivers, passengers, pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclists, commercial vehicle operators, and those who work to build and maintain the Nation’s four million miles of roadways. The&amp;nbsp; Federal government is the only entity that has the authority to establish national safety standards for vehicles, regulate interstate motor carriers, and mandate roadway safety features.

Stakeholders:

FHWA, FMCSA, and NHTSA have formed strategic alliances with partners from a wide array of backgrounds to enhance and forward the Nation’s roadway safety agenda through guidance, technical assistance, and development of resource materials. Many stakeholders currently address transportation safety issues independently, through individual goals, plans, and activities. Some have implemented substantial safety initiatives, and these contributions are vital to maintaining and improving roadway safety. As described in the RSP, involvement by multiple stakeholders provides opportunities for broader public outreach and for the development and implementation of cross-cutting roadway safety strategies reflecting the common interests of many parties.

Each partner offers unique strengths and abilities to assist each mode to deliver its programs and leverage resources in protecting the public on the Nation’s roadways.&amp;nbsp; Progress toward a national roadway safety goal requires collaboration with a diverse group of stakeholders and partners across a range of disciplines.&amp;nbsp; The agencies within DOT work with a network of partner organizations, such as State Highway Safety Offices, State transportation departments, Tribal governments, local and county traffic engineers, law enforcement agencies, public health associations, safety advocacy groups, the motorcoach industry, hazardous shipping businesses, interstate trucking operations and the auto industry on the development of evidence-based roadway safety programs, projects, and safety standards.&amp;nbsp; Such collaboration will help to integrate a broad range of factors affecting roadway safety and create more efficient and effective problem-solving synergies across the transportation industry.

Challenges:

A number of challenges could slow down or even reverse positive trends.&amp;nbsp; Many States continue to face budget shortfalls and are under tremendous pressure to reduce services, resulting in cut backs to roadway safety programs.&amp;nbsp; Cutbacks in State, Tribal and local law enforcement agency budgets could weaken national enforcement campaigns and local traffic safety enforcement efforts.&amp;nbsp; States, Tribes, and local governments must be willing to use data-driven analytical processes to make the best and most effective safety investments.

Distracted driving has emerged as a new threat over the past few years as the rise of portable electronic devices has swiftly expanded.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Moreover, as in-vehicle electronic systems become ever more sophisticated and complex, distracted driving could become an even greater threat if it is not addressed in a manner keeping pace with technological advancements.&amp;nbsp; In fact, a new report by the Governors' Highway Safety Association (GHSA) cites 50 percent of the US adult population now owning smartphones and the wireless industry reports a subscription penetration rate of 102.2 percent (^1).&amp;nbsp; Also, as the economy continues to gain momentum, more recreational travel and driving may lead to higher crash rates.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Additionally, safety defects in vehicles that are not addressed in a safe and efficiently manner can lead toward more serious vehicle crashes and injuries.&amp;nbsp; Finally, the repeal of proven life-saving traffic safety laws at the State level, such as universal motorcycle helmet or primary seat belt laws, could also result in higher injuries and fatalities.&amp;nbsp; Nevertheless, significant opportunities remain for continued progress in reducing roadway fatalities.&amp;nbsp; The Department will seek new and innovative ways to serve the American people and keep our roadways safe.

MAP-21, The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act&amp;nbsp;(P.L 112-141), was signed into law by President Obama on July 6, 2012.&amp;nbsp; MAP-21 provides an increase in safety funds available for the Highway Safety Improvement Program along with a focus on performance-based programming.&amp;nbsp; Implementation of MAP-21 will rely heavily on increased partnership across State agencies&amp;nbsp;with DOT.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, the shift to performance-based programming may require additional effort on the part of some States.&amp;nbsp; There are also&amp;nbsp;challenges associated with improving safety with local roads and local agencies with Federal-aid program funds, as well as the capacity and willingness of States to use data-driven and analytical processes to make the best safety infrastructure investments.

Rather than accepting a certain number of crashes as unavoidable, a TZD approach commits to working across sectors and using every tool available to systemically analyze and eliminate fatal traffic crashes among all who use the roadways.&amp;nbsp; FHWA, NHTSA and FMCSA provided technical support to a group of organizations that represent professionals with an active role in highway safety that developed National Strategy on Highway Safety Towards Zero Deaths which identifies a platform of options for state agencies, private industry, national organizations, and others to use in developing safety plans that prioritize traffic safety culture and promote the national TZD vision.

The Secretary launched a new pedestrian and bicycle initiative to promote design improvements to ensure safe and efficient routes for pedestrians and bicycles, promote safe behavior, and provide education to help individuals make safer travel choices. This new initiative, “Safer People, Safer Streets,”&amp;nbsp;has two key components: 1) the Mayors’ Challenge and 2) road safety assessments.&amp;nbsp; Over 200 cities signed up for the Mayors’ Challenge and a portion of these cities participated in a Mayors’ Summit at USDOT in March.&amp;nbsp; Over the next year, these cities aim to make improvements in one or more of seven Challenge Activities.&amp;nbsp; By June 1st, 2015 every State completed a pedestrian/bicyclist safety assessment.&amp;nbsp; DOT field offices are collaborating to convene and lead the assessments.&amp;nbsp; The Office of the Secretary also established a multi-modal Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety Action Team of the Safety Council that meets regularly to support these two activities and coordinate other efforts to improve pedestrian and bicyclist safety.

FHWA is also working to implement recommendations from the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Office of Inspector General (OIG) evaluations of the HSIP to improve a State’s ability to meet targets.&amp;nbsp; As part of this effort, FHWA included in the recent initiative to update the HSIP regulations requirements that States adopt and use a common set of fundamental data elements (i.e., Model Inventory of Roadway Elements).&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

FHWA is also implementing the transformational performance management framework enacted in MAP-21.&amp;nbsp; States will invest resources in projects to achieve individual targets that collectively will make progress toward national goals.&amp;nbsp; FHWA is incorporating these requirements into various performance management and planning regulations.

&amp;nbsp;

As new vehicle technologies develop and mature, NHTSA will continue to keep raising the bar on safety, and accelerate its push on innovative to reduce the toll of motor vehicle crashes through the development of new motor vehicle safety standards, and guidance to the industry and the public.&amp;nbsp; NHTSA actively enforces vehicle safety as well.&amp;nbsp; In 2014 alone, NHTSA issued more than $126 million in civil penalties to auto manufacturers, exceeding the total amount collected by the agency during its 43-year history.&amp;nbsp; NHTSA is also taking steps to strengthen its Office of Defects Investigations (ODI) that addresses OIG recommendations from its June 2015 Audit Report.&amp;nbsp; The agency has created a blueprint, NHTSA’s Path Forward that lays out lessons learned from recent challenges, and ways to improve performance.&amp;nbsp; To help implement these changes, NHTSA also has created a Safety Systems Team of outside experts.

FMCSA regulates approximately 532, 000 active interstate (including approximately 12,000 passenger carriers) and hazardous materials motor carriers and 6 million active commercial driver’s license (CDL) holders.&amp;nbsp; In 2013, the Department estimated that these companies operated 11 million large trucks and buses, traveling over 290 billion vehicle miles.&amp;nbsp; Over a ten-year period, 2004 through 2013, the number of large trucks involved in fatal crashes decreased from 4,902 to 3,906, a drop of 20 percent.&amp;nbsp; Also, the rate of buses involved in fatal crashes decreased from 4.10 per 100 million VMT to 1.85 per 100 million VMT. &amp;nbsp;Major agency initiatives include the Safety Management System to prioritize motor carriers for interventions and to evaluate a carrier’s safety performance; Enhanced Investigative Techniques to improve enforcement rates; and the launch of the National Registry of Certified Medical Examiners (NRCME) in 2014 to provide consistent, standardized medical examinations for all commercial drivers.&amp;nbsp; More than 11,000 examiners are currently listed under the NRCME.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

At the same time, we have seen significant progress in reducing the number of passenger vehicle (PV) occupant fatalities, and have exceeded that target goal in 2012 (the most current year available for this data). &amp;nbsp;A record high national seat belt use rate and high levels of child safety seats helped achieve this result.&amp;nbsp; High visibility enforcement campaigns, effective at increasing seat belt use, have contributed toward this success. &amp;nbsp;Safer vehicles also played an important role in reducing these fatalities.&amp;nbsp; A new report estimates that from 1962 through 2012, seat belts alone have saved nearly 330,000 lives.&amp;nbsp; Other safety technology and equipment, such as air bags, child safety seats and electronic stability control, have saved an additional 280,000 lives.&amp;nbsp; Advanced new crash avoidance technology, such as automatic emergency braking systems (AEB) represents the next generation of vehicle safety.&amp;nbsp; These AEB systems, along with promising innovations such as vehicle-to-vehicle communications (V2V) and automated vehicle technologies hold great promise to save even more lives, building upon the successes of technologies available today.

Milestones Contributing to Safer Behavior

Commercial Motor Carrier Safety: Effective August 23, 2014, the&amp;nbsp;Agency implemented a new process for addressing adjudicated citations in FMCSA’s data systems such as SMS and the Pre-employment Screening Program. &amp;nbsp;Likewise, the&amp;nbsp;Agency continues to support the expanded suite of intervention tools to enable investigators to systematically evaluate why safety problems are occurring in order to recommend remedies, encourage corrective action(s), and, where corrective action is inadequate, invoke strong penalties. FMCSA’s&amp;nbsp;December 31, 2014, Motor Carrier Safety Progress Report shows that the Agency transmitted 20,480 Warning Letters in FY 2013 and 20,546 in FY 2014. A total of&amp;nbsp;5,183&amp;nbsp;warning letters were sent out during&amp;nbsp;during the first quarter of FY2015 (10/01/2014 - 12/31/2014).

New Entrant Safety Assurance Program (NESAP):&amp;nbsp; At present, this program requires a new entrant (NE) motor carrier to be monitored for 18 months and to submit to a Safety Audit during this period to determine if the carrier is fit to operate safely. Upon successful completion of this program, the carrier is granted permanent registration.&amp;nbsp; With the enactment of MAP-21, beginning October 1, 2013, NE property carriers have to submit to a safety audit within 12 months from the beginning of operations, while motorcoach operators are required to have a safety audit within 4 months of beginning operations.&amp;nbsp;In FY 2013, FMCSA-trained NESAP safety auditors conducted an estimated 32,890 safety audits.&amp;nbsp;32,172 safety audits were conducted&amp;nbsp;in FY2014 and 17,978 Out of Service Orders were issued. In the fourth quarter of FY 2012,&amp;nbsp;the Agency&amp;nbsp;received the independent contractor analysis and evaluation of the NESAP. FMCSA has completed its New Entrant program evaluation to determine the effectiveness of the Final Rule that was implemented in December 2009.&amp;nbsp; After review,&amp;nbsp;FMCSA contracted for additional work that was completed in FY2013.&amp;nbsp; FMCSA is incorporating this additional work and completed its New Entrant program evaluation. Results are anticipated in&amp;nbsp;late FY2015.

Compliance, Safety, Accountability (CSA) program. FMCSA completed the Safety Measurement System (SMS) effectiveness report. The CSA effectiveness research report was delivered for review which includes CSA metrics and the interventions effectiveness model. In preparing for national rollout of the third and final phase of the CSA program, FMCSA formed a new Federal and State Partner Continuous Improvement Work Group. The new Work Group – consisting of 20 representatives from the States and FMCSA – is conducting analysis and providing recommendations to the Agency for how to make the CSA program deliver on its stated objectives and serve FMCSA's and its State partners’ commercial motor vehicle (CMV) safety compliance and enforcement programs.

Enhanced Investigative Techniques (EIT). Over the first three quarters of FY2014, 196 Field Operations personnel participated in an intensive four-day Enhanced Investigative Techniques (EIT) training course.&amp;nbsp;The EIT training was initially developed for the Motorcoach Safety Initiative known as Quick Strike.&amp;nbsp; The impressive safety results from the Quick Strike initiative included a 75% enforcement rate, a 26% average vehicle OOS rate, and 14 Imminent Hazard OOS orders issued to motor carriers investigated under the initiative.&amp;nbsp; All FMCSA field staff received EIT training by November 2014.&amp;nbsp; Our State partners are receiving EIT training in 2015.

Traffic Law Enforcement:&amp;nbsp; NHTSA’s Data-Driven Approaches to Crime and Traffic Safety (DDACTS) program integrates location-based crime and traffic data to establish effective and efficient methods for deploying law enforcement resources.&amp;nbsp; NHTSA conducted a series of 8 workshops in&amp;nbsp;FY2014 Quarters 1 and 2 to help States develop DDACTS programs.

NHTSA also conducted three High Visibility Enforcement Campaigns in FY 2013 to promote seat belt use and reduce impaired driving and launched a national Law Enforcement Liaison Program to enhance traffic law enforcement initiatives with law enforcement agencies nationwide.&amp;nbsp; NHTSA also released an evaluation of its successful distracted driving high visibility enforcement pilot projects in Connecticut, New York, California and Delaware.

NHTSA published two new impaired driving resources:&amp;nbsp; 1) A new screening tool, the “Impaired Driving Assessment,” to help law enforcement identify a DWI offender’s risk of engaging in future conduct of impaired driving, and to help determine the most effective community supervision that will reduce such risk; and 2) Model Guideline for State Ignition Interlock Programs to help strengthen and expand State ignition interlock programs in&amp;nbsp;FY2014.

NHTSA also released a new 5-year a new strategic plan for older drivers that will serve as a roadmap to ensure the safety of our nation's growing population of older drivers and passengers in FY 2014.

Consumer Awareness Safety Campaigns completed in FY 2014:


	“Where’s Baby?&amp;nbsp; Look before you lock” to address heatstroke in children left behind in vehicles;
	“5 to Drive” to encourage parents of teens to talk about the 5 key risks to their young drivers; and
	“TireWise” to promote proper tire maintenance to help consumers keep their vehicles running safely.


NHTSA also released a major new report in FY 2014 showing that the total annual economic and societal costs of motor vehicle crashes are $871 billion per year.

Milestones Contributing to Safer Vehicles

The development of new vehicle safety technology continues to play an important role in reducing roadway crashes. NHTSA completed a large scale pilot project in December 2013 of 2,800 vehicles equipped with vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) proto-type safety communications technology to test the feasibility and potential benefits of V2V systems to help reduce, mitigate, or prevent crashes and collisions.&amp;nbsp; In February 2014, the agency announced that it will begin taking steps to enable V2V communication technology for light vehicles.

In April 2013, NHTSA published Phase 1 of its distraction guidelines that encourage automobile manufacturers to limit the distraction risk connected to electronic devices built into their vehicles, such as communications, entertainment, and navigation devices.&amp;nbsp; The agency held a public meeting in February 2014 to bring together vehicle manufacturers and suppliers, portable and aftermarket device manufacturers, portable and aftermarket device operating system providers, cellular service providers, industry associations, “app” developers, researchers, and consumer groups to discuss technical issues regarding the agency's development of Phase 2 Driver Distraction Guidelines for portable and aftermarket devices.

FY 2014 Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSSs) Update:

NHTSA published an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking requesting public input on a proposal to create a new FMVSS, No. 150, to require vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication capability for light vehicles (passenger cars and light truck vehicles (LTVs)) and to create minimum performance requirements for V2V devices and messages.&amp;nbsp; The agency also published a research report on the V2V pilot project for comment which described analysis of research findings in several key areas including technical feasibility, privacy and security, and preliminary estimates of costs and safety benefits.

NHTSA published a final rule requiring rear visibility technology in all new vehicles under 10,000 pounds by May 2018. This new rule enhances the safety of these vehicles by significantly reducing the risk of fatalities and serious injuries caused by backover incidents.

A final rule requiring lap and shoulder seat belts for each passenger and driver seat on new motorcoaches and other large buses was also published. This new rule enhances the safety of these vehicles by significantly reducing the risk of fatalities and serious injuries in frontal crashes and the risk of occupant ejection in rollovers.

Vehicle Safety Recalls in FY 2014:


	In FY 2014, NHTSA fined automakers more than $52 million in civil penalties failing to report vehicle safety defects in a timely manner as required by law
	NHTSA launched a new, free, online search tool consumers can use to find out if a vehicle is directly impacted by a recall. The new tool, available on www.safercar.gov/vinlookup, provides consumers with a quick and easy way to identify uncompleted recalls by entering their Vehicle Identification Number (VIN). All major light vehicle and motorcycle brands can be searched.
	NHTSA also launched a new safety campaign and Car Seat Finder Tool, adding the ability to look up car seat recalls on its mobile app, and reminding parents and caregivers to register their child’s car seat through its new campaign – “Don’t Delay. Register Your Car Seat Today.”&amp;nbsp; Completed 4th&amp;nbsp;Quarter FY 2014.
	NHTSA announced mandatory distinctive labels on required mailings by vehicle manufacturers to owners to ensure that the owners can quickly recognize recall notices and take action to get their recalled vehicles or equipment fixed in a timely manner.
	Due in part to these upgrades and to recent high-profile recall efforts, NHTSA received a record number of vehicle complaint inquiries, totaling over 80,000.


FMCSA published a supplemental NPRM&amp;nbsp;on Electronic Logging Devices (ELD) and Hours of Service (HOS) Supporting Documents in FY 2014.&amp;nbsp; The SNPRM includes:


	proposed requirements for ELDs that would improve compliance with the HOS rules.
	ELD technical specifications;
	measures to prevent the harassment drivers who use ELDs and,
	the mandatory use of ELDs by drivers who are currently required to prepare logbooks.


This rulemaking would impose costs of approximately $1.5 billion but provide safety benefits and paperwork savings in excess of $ 1.9 billion.

QCMobile Smartphone App – On March 17, 2015 FMCSA announced a new Smartphone app that allows for more convenient access to currently available online safety performance information for interstate truck and bus companies. &amp;nbsp;The new app is called “QCMobile,” (QC standing for “Query Central”).&amp;nbsp; It is expected to be a valuable tool for State and federal law enforcement personnel, as well as insurers, brokers, freight-forwarders, and others interested in reviewing the USDOT registration and safety performance information of motor carriers. &amp;nbsp;The new QCMobile app, which requires no log-in, immediately reveals whether the federal operating status of the carrier is authorized while helping to expedite an “inspect/pass” decision by a certified commercial vehicle safety inspector.

Milestones Contributing to Safer Roadways

As an indicator of progress, FHWA measures the obligation rate of the Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) funds apportioned to the States. The HSIP obligations by the States through the first quarter of fiscal year 2015 was&amp;nbsp;74.9 percent, for combined SAFETEA-LU and MAP-21 HSIP funds, which is an increase compared to the&amp;nbsp;68.9 percent obligated through the first quarter of 2015.&amp;nbsp; States have obligated over $324.9 million through the first quarter of 2015, which is more than the $228.6 million obligated during the same time period in 2014. During the first quarter of 2015, States obligated 89.7 percent and de-obligated $3.7 million of SAFETEA-LU funds and obligated 48.8 percent and $328.5 of MAP-21 funds, as compared to the same quarter in 2014 with 87.2 percent and $22.6 million of SAFETEA-LU funds obligated and 26.4 percent and $206 million of MAP-21 funds obligated 2014.

It is important to note the following:


	MAP-21 provided a dramatic influx of funds, approximately $1 billion higher than the average annual apportionment from SAFETEA-LU.
	HSIP obligation rates have the greatest increases toward the end of the fiscal year.


FHWA provides States with guidance for the implementation of MAP-21 safety programs and reporting, which includes HSIP, Older Driver and Pedestrian Special Rule Interim Guidance, High Risk Rural Roads, and State Safety Data Systems.&amp;nbsp; All guidance can be found online at http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/guidance.

FHWA is implementing the performance elements of MAP-21 to further promote the most efficient investment of Federal transportation funds to significantly reduce fatalities and serious injuries.&amp;nbsp; FHWA is actively working to implement the new regulatory requirements on safety performance management and the updated requirements for the HSIP.&amp;nbsp; Notices of Proposed Rulemaking for both rules were issued in Summer 2014. FHWA is currently reviewing comments and preparing the Final Rules. These regulations, in conjunction with NHTSA performance management requirements, will emphasize a data-driven performance based approach to improving highway safety, provide transparency and accountability for highway safety investment decisions, and assist states in improving roadway and safety data.

In support of the development of new Strategic Highway Safety Plans (SHSP), FHWA posted several tools online including Strategic Highway Safety Plans: A Champions Guidebook to Saving Lives Second Edition and SHSP Evaluation Process Model, Manual for Selecting Safety Improvements on High Risk Rural Road, and Saving Lives Together: The Highway Safety and EMS Connection.

During fiscal year 2015, a new performance indicator for Data-Driven Safety Analysis (DDSA) will be added as part of the Every Day Counts (EDC) 3.0 initiative. DDSA builds on decades of past work and current collaborative efforts to promote the science of safety in the transportation community, with the ultimate goal of saving lives. The effort focuses on broadening implementation of two advances – predictive approaches and systemic approaches – into safety management processes and project development decision-making.

FMCSA implemented the National Registry of Certified Medical Examiners program (https://nationalregistry.fmcsa.dot.gov/NRPublicUI/home.seam).&amp;nbsp; All commercial drivers whose current medical certificate expires on or after May 21, 2014 must be examined by a medical professional listed on the National Registry of Certified Medical Examiners. To date, nearly 37,000 healthcare professionals have been certified to conduct driver medical exams and more than 1,742,265 examinations have been completed in FY 2014.

FMCSA completed a Field Study on the Efficacy of the New Restart Provision for Hours of Service.

</objective_statement><objective_overview>Based on current economic and demographic forecasts, it is likely that the movement of people and goods within the U.S. and abroad will continue to increase and the transportation sector will continue to enable economic growth and job creation.  The transportation sector contributed approximately $1.466 trillion, or 9.7 percent, to GDP in 2011.  Our Nation must make strategic investments that enable the movement of people and goods more efficiently with full utilization of the existing capacity across all transportation modes. The cornerstones of this strategy are investments in high-performance passenger rail, the development of a national freight strategy, investments in public transportation, mitigating traffic congestion on our highways, and implementing NextGen to improve operations and alleviate airport congestion.
</objective_overview></Strategic_Objective><Strategic_Objective><id>5061</id><objective_header>IMPROVE SAFETY OF TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM </objective_header><objective_statement>Improve the safety of the transportation system across all modes of travel by addressing behavioral, vehicular, and infrastructure safety issues through prevention, mitigation, data sharing and analysis, and response using innovative and effective partnerships, programs, and resources.
</objective_statement><objective_overview>In 2011, 34,414 people died and more than 2.2 million people were injured in transportation-related crashes and accidents, according to U.S. DOT national Transportation Statistics.  Motor vehicle crashes caused 32,367 fatalities, or 94 percent of the total, even though the rate of fatalities per hundred million miles of travel was the lowest ever recorded in the United States.  Distracted driving was a contributing factor in at least 3,331 fatal crashes.  Another 1, 213 people died in rail, air, and transit accidents.  We will use our safety programs and regulations for automobiles, airplanes, railroads, trucks, motorcoaches, pipelines, and hazardous materials as effectively as possible to reduce crashes, fatalities, and injuries, and will expand safety oversight to public transit.  We will continue to direct federal resources to address the most serious safety risks and implement program reforms that will advance our safety mission. Between 2001 and 2010, an average of 13 people in the United States died every year in incidents related to the transportation of hazardous material—a rate of one death for every 21 billion ton-miles of hazardous material moved.  In addition to causing deaths and injuries, hazardous material transportation incidents disrupt communities when people are evacuated from their homes, business activity is curtailed, and transportation services are interrupted.  We will continue to develop and encourage the use of safety tools - such as improved data collection, risk management practices, and incident response planning - to prevent, mitigate, and respond to hazardous material transportation accidents.
