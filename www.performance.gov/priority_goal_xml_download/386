By September 30, 2015, reduce rates of repeat incarceration in three target tribal communities by 3% through a comprehensive “alternatives to incarceration” strategy that seeks to address underlying causes of repeat offenses, including substance abuse and social service needs through tribal and federal partnerships.
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Problem or opportunity being addressed

The rate of recidivism nationally among Native Americans is estimated to be 33% higher than non-native populations, according to one Department of Justice report. Locally recidivism creates a huge drain on already overtaxed economies as well as overcrowded and dilapidated detention facilities.Individuals who repeat offend and are incarcerated, fill court dockets, and in many cases take primary bread winners out of the home.

Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives

This goal and associated activities will facilitate the ability of Interior to realize one of the President’s key objectives and a key priority for the Secretary of the Interior.&amp;nbsp; The effort is in direct support of the goal to re-establish the relationship with Indian Tribes and support the Strategic Goal to “Advance Government-to-Government Relationships with Indian Nations and Honor Commitments to Insular Areas.”

Key barriers and challenges 

Conducting a focused program in highly geographically dispersed communities, with high levels of crime, disparate levels of staffing and training, and equipment have proven to be significant challenges.&amp;nbsp; Cooperation and support from Federal, State and tribal participants is a key requirement.&amp;nbsp; Tribal justice program commitment, differences and gaps in technology and program availability and participation is a key issue.&amp;nbsp; Funding increases for these program components has been aligned with the priority goal making this more feasible.

Other key challenges may include but not limited to:


	Record access of Tribal Correctional facilities
	Availability of funding for components of the program that are not under Interior’s jurisdiction, e.g. detention facilities
	Availability of substance abuse treatment programs – social program budgets, staffing and capacity have not kept pace with the increased law enforcement effort
	Sentencing resources and alternative program availability.


Stakeholder Engagement

The Department conducts consultation with tribal leaders and other stakeholders during the development of the budget and prior to the development and implementation of the Priority Goal on their respective reservations. This ensures a high level of understanding and commitment is received from all parties.

The Department has already begun to assist the Tribes in developing alternative to incarceration strategic plans based on the available resources in the community and or resources that stakeholders can provide to assist.

The Department assists the tribal programs with developing and coordinating stakeholder and community meetings throughout the initiative to discuss progress and any barriers or issues that may negatively affect meeting the goal.

Significance of the Accomplishment (through the Priority Goal) especially in relation to past experience and benefit to the public

BIA collaborated extensively with the three participating tribes to put in place the means for reducing recidivism.&amp;nbsp; Implementation included identifying and engaging relevant federal partners, tribal leaders, and local service providers in aligning re-offenders with treatment and recovery services as well as alternatives to incarceration such as probation, courts specific to substance abuse cases, and traditional cultural courts.&amp;nbsp;

As part of the collaboration, BIA’s Office of Justice Services (OJS) conducted weekly coaching conference calls with each of the participating tribes to discuss:


	Proper administration of a nationally recognized standardized assessment instrument, Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN), to help address substance abuse and social service needs.&amp;nbsp; GAIN is a set of measures used to assess the breadth and frequency of problems and service utilization related to substance abuse (including diagnosis and course, treatment motivation, and relapse potential), physical health, risk/protective involvement, mental health, environment and vocational situation. &amp;nbsp;
	How to establish a follow up protocol for tracking and measuring offender progress; and
	Options for how tribes can begin using this screening and assessment instrument as a standardized protocol for individuals presenting for alcohol and substance concerns as a part of the justice system and/or anywhere within the service community.


BIA will use the data on recidivism reduction from the three participating pilot tribes over the FY 2014-15 period to inform the continuation of this priority goal into the FY 2016-17 period, including expansion to two additional tribes. &amp;nbsp;BIA is in the process of compiling a more detailed report of the FY 2014-15 recidivism reduction initiative data including activities, services, infrastructure development implemented to enhance the ongoing success of the initiative, and&amp;nbsp;lessons learned to identify what services are working, what services are missing and what is needed to expand into a full and complete service continuum intended to reduce recidivism.
