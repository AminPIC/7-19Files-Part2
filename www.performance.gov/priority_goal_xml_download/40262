By September 30, 2017, NSF will fund at least three summer institutes and 75 supplements to existing awards to provide STEM doctoral students with opportunities to expand their knowledge and skills to prepare for a range of careers.
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>A strong global economy is reliant on the ability to capitalize on technical innovations that result from a skilled and agile STEM workforce. As a result, the Nation’s scientific workforce must evolve and mature to include more doctoral level researchers in positions outside of academia. These positions require comprehensive preparation in science at the graduate level, as well as proficiency in other critical skills.

Surveys of graduate students analyzed in recent reports have demonstrated that graduate student training has not kept pace with STEM workforce needs beyond traditional roles in academia. In recent years there has been a shift in the job market for science and engineering doctorate holder that has resulted in more varied career choices. Scientists and engineers with doctorates are now more evenly split between the business sector (45%) and the education sector (46%) (Source: Survey of Earned Doctorates,&amp;nbsp;National Science Foundation, National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics 2013). Within the&amp;nbsp;education sector, over 90 percent&amp;nbsp;of doctorates are employed at 4-year institutions. However, Ph.D. training remains largely focused on preparation for the research component of academic careers with an emphasis on skills needed at research institutions. There is considerable value to traditional academic training, which can provide doctoral graduates with experience in critical thinking as well as oral and written communication

The purpose of this Priority Goal is to provide opportunities for science and engineering doctoral students so they can acquire the knowledge, experience, and skills needed for highly productive careers, inside and outside of academe. Although investments in the Graduate Research Internship Program (GRIP) and Graduate Research Opportunities Worldwide (GROW) provide support across disciplines that help address this issue, a larger, agency-wide effort directed at the specific goal of determining effective approaches to increased graduate student preparedness is needed.

The activities in this APG will be undertaken in coordination with NSF’s forthcoming strategic plan for investment in graduate students and graduate education. In addition, these approaches will be reported at the NSTC Committee on STEM Education’s Interagency Working Group on Graduate Education (co-chaired by NSF and NIH) as a possible model for consideration by other agencies.

In addition, these approaches will be reported at the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) Committee on STEM Education’s Interagency Working Group on Graduate Education (co-chaired by NSF and NIH).

The NSTC Committee on STEM notes that “tomorrow’s STEM workforce will need to include effective change makers and entrepreneurs in business, public service, civil society, and academia. Some universities are encouraging students to set and meet more ambitious goals for their research, education, and service; giving students greater autonomy earlier in their career; connecting students to real-world problems at a regional, national, and global level; and involving students in the design of university curricula, research initiatives, and collaborations with external partners.”&amp;nbsp; This APG will explore ways to partner with universities to identify and spread promising practices for achieving this vision.

</next_steps><progress_update>FY 2016 Q4

There were no specific targets identified&amp;nbsp;for this APG&amp;nbsp;in the fourth quarter of FY 2016. Over the course of the first year of the Improving Graduate Student Preparedness APG,&amp;nbsp;the three major targets were either&amp;nbsp;met or exceeded. First, NSF 16-067, a Dear Colleague Letter: Improving Graduate Student Preparedness for Entering the Workforce, Opportunities for Supplemental Support which aims to solicit applications for supplements, was issued and eighty supplements&amp;nbsp;have been&amp;nbsp;supported to date. In year one, NSF exceeded&amp;nbsp;its two-year goal of funding seventy-five supplements. NSF will continue to support supplements in year two. Second, a common set of metrics was developed and data has been collected for the FY 2016 supplement awards. Third, the final&amp;nbsp;goal of requesting proposals for summer institutes was also achieved and one award was made. &amp;nbsp;

FY 2016 Q3

The first&amp;nbsp;goal of Q3 to&amp;nbsp;develop a common set of metrics to provide to awardees of supplemental awards was achieved. The metrics were included in the Evaluation Plan for the Graduate Student Preparedness APG. The second goal of Q3&amp;nbsp;to request proposals for summer institutes was also achieved and one award has&amp;nbsp;already been made. The Dear Colleague Letter (NSF 16-067)&amp;nbsp;soliciting supplements for graduate preparedness activities was successful in encouraging a sufficiently large number of proposals that&amp;nbsp;the requirement of 75 supplements over the two fiscal years of the APG&amp;nbsp;has nearly&amp;nbsp;been&amp;nbsp;met&amp;nbsp;- final numbers for FY 2016 will be provided in FY 2017 Q1.

FY 2016 Q2

The Q2 milestone was achieved through the issuance of NSF 16-067, a Dear Colleague Letter: Improving Graduate Student Preparedness for Entering the Workforce, Opportunities for Supplemental Support which aims to solicit applications for supplements. The internal Graduate Preparedness Working Group recently met with staff from the Council of Graduate Schools to discuss their current activities related to the APG, and plans to continue these discussions to determine where targeted NSF investments could positively impact graduate preparedness across a wide range of disciplines.

FY 2016 Q1

There were no targets for this APG identified for the first quarter of FY 2016. Good progress is being made towards the upcoming performance targets. Specifically, the Graduate Preparedness Working Group is meeting regularly and a draft Dear Colleague Letter (DCL) has been developed which is planned for publication in the second quarter. Discussions are being initiated with external groups to provide NSF with assistance in developing a common set of metrics that would be provided to awardees of both summer institutes and supplemental awards.

</objective_statement><objective_overview>The global competitiveness of the United States in the 21st century depends directly on the readiness of the Nation’s STEM workforce.  Educational institutions around the country must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy.  One of NSF’s most enduring contributions to the national innovation ecosystem is the integration of education and research in the activities we support.  When students participate in cutting-edge research activities under the guidance of the Nation’s most creative scientists and engineers, the students can gain the up-to-date knowledge and practical, hands-on experience needed to develop into creative contributors who can engage in innovative activities throughout all sectors of society.  The successive cadres of high-tech workers, each armed with practical knowledge of the most advanced thinking and technology of the day, create the flow of highly adaptable human capital needed to power discovery and innovation. NSF also supports the development of a strong STEM workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning. Such improvements include effective curricular and teaching strategies for increased student learning, as well as new approaches enabled by advanced classroom technologies.  Investments in social science and education research in learning, teaching, and institutions can have major impacts when derived insights are applied to the education of the STEM workforce.
The transformation of the frontiers of science and engineering requires dramatic change in the diversity of S&amp;amp;E communities.  The demographic evolution in the United States is reflected in a strong, growing workforce whose makeup is changing rapidly.  Women and members of minority groups represent an expanding portion of the country’s potential intellectual capital. NSF is committed to increasing access for currently underrepresented groups to STEM education and careers through our investments in research and education. The resulting enhancement of diversity is essential to provide the strength that comes from diverse perspectives, as well as to assure development of the Nation’s intellectual capital.
