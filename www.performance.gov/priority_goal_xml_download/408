By the end of FY 2015, increase the use of services on-line by 25 percent (from a baseline of 367,000 annuitants), and increase the percentage of complete cases received from agencies to 95 percent or greater (from a baseline of 89 percent) with the long term goal of 100 percent of cases received as complete.In addition, by FY 2015, OPM will develop capabilities to receive electronic retirement applications.
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is responsible for the administration of the Federal Retirement Program covering over 2.7 million active employees and nearly 2.6 million annuitants. This responsibility is shared with agency partners who counsel their employees and administer the initial retirement application process, and submit the employee’s application, with all supporting documentation, to OPM’s Retirement Services. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;OPM remains committed to improving all areas of retirement case related production by refining and implementing Lean Six Sigma activities, providing needed training and development, and diverting resources to areas needing concentrated efforts. In order to make comprehensive improvements to retirement claims processing, OPM will continue to focus on the following four pillars: People; Productivity and Process Improvement; Partnerships with Agencies; and Partial, Progressive IT Improvements.

In FY 2015, the surge included approximately 30,000 new claims, exceeding projections and stretching from January into February. In previous years, OPM has hired additional staff at the beginning of the fiscal year to offset the increased workload. Due to resource constraints, OPM was not able to use this approach in FY 2015.

&amp;nbsp;

Of the 1.9 million annuitants, more than 513,000 unique users accessed Services Online in FY 2015, an increase of nearly 40 percent from the baseline of 367,000, exceeding the target of 25 percent.&amp;nbsp; As of the end of FY 2015, an average of 87.7 percent of retirement applications submissions that OPM received were considered complete. This is an increase over the FY 2014 rate of 84 percent, but short of the target of 95 percent. Data is posted on the OPM website: http://www.opm.gov/about-us/budget-performance/strategic-plans/agency-audit-monthly-update.pdf

&amp;nbsp;

Additional highlights are described below.

&amp;nbsp;


	OPM’s claims processing accuracy rate was 94.0&amp;nbsp;percent as of August&amp;nbsp;2015, using a weighted average (FY 2015&amp;nbsp;target was 95 percent).This rate remains unchanged from the FY 2014 rate of 94 percent.
	OPM achieved a FY 2015 call handling rate of 72.0&amp;nbsp;percent. In FY 2015, OPM received approximately 1.9 million retirement program customer service calls, approximately 200,000 additional calls when compared with FY 2014. In FY 2015, OPM handled an additional 96,000 calls when compared with FY 2014. Due to high call volumes, however, the overall call handling rate decreased from the FY 2014 rate of 76 percent.
	In FY 2015, four individuals from the United States Postal Service (USPS) came to Boyers for six weeks during the surge to provide assistance on the front end processes. In FY 2016, four individuals from USPS and seven from the Defense Finance and Accounting Services (DFAS) will be coming to Boyers for four to six weeks during the surge to once again provide assistance on the front end process.
	In FY 2015, OPM delivered six webinars that received more than 20,000 views.&amp;nbsp; Because the webcasts are hosted online, they continue to provide training to benefits officers on key topics related to retirement. The webinars are available at: https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/benefits-officers-center/training/.
	The 2015 Annual Training Survey was emailed to more than 1,100 HR specialists, and 228 respondents completed the survey. Of the respondents, 38.7 percent have watched a Webcast in the last 12 months, 45.4 percent have received their training from Benefits Officers Training and Development, and 39.7 percent prefer in person training.&amp;nbsp; Seventeen percent of respondents would like to receive training in retirement benefits and 13.5 percent would like Social Security training.
	OPM expanded&amp;nbsp;agency human resources and payroll office access to the Retirement Data Repository via Data Viewer.

OPM will continue to focus on improving retirement claims processing, and has set a new retirement services case processing Agency Priority Goal for 2016-2017.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>The Federal government’s commitment to its employees does not end when someone retires from service. OPM administers retirement and insurance benefits for approximately 2.5 million annuitants, survivors, and family members. We must ensure quality delivery of those benefits and respond to retiree questions and concerns in a caring and timely manner. While real progress has been made over the last four years and the strategies outlined below have been implemented in part, they are yet to be finalized and our retirees are yet to realize the full extent of the improvements. Additionally, recognizing that successful benefits processing is a result of not just an efficient processing system or communication with agencies but also a fully engaged employee who is preparing to retire.
