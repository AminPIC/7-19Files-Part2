</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Aviation fatality rates are at historic lows and continue to drop over time.&amp;nbsp; However, FAA recognizes the need to continue addressing precursors to accidents in order to continue to improve the current level of safety in the national airspace.

In the past, the FAA focused on actual incidents and accidents to identify risk within the aviation system.&amp;nbsp; The number of accidents has now dropped to a level in which this is a more difficult activity. &amp;nbsp;The FAA has now developed a proactive approach to identify and address risk.&amp;nbsp; This is done through dramatically increased air traffic data collection, improved analysis, and the implementation of safety mitigations put in place before an accident occurs.

</next_steps><progress_update>Commercial Air Carrier Fatality Rate: Progress update:

For the fourth quarter of FY15, the Commercial Air Carrier Fatality Rate is green. As of September 30, 2015 that rate was 0.1 versus a not-to-exceed (NTE) rate of 6.9 fatalities per 100 million persons on board. This equates to 1 actual fatality versus a not-to-exceed total number of fatalities of 57 for the year. There have been 0 Part 121 fatal accidents for FY2015 and 1 Part 135 (commuter) fatal accidents with 1 fatality for the year. Based on current data and analysis of preliminary data, the FAA met the target for FY15.

The FAA continues to work with aviation industry stakeholders to establish and implement safety management systems to address and reduce risk within their operations and the NAS. The FAA also has several prominent rulemaking projects that respond to changes identified during the investigation of the fatal Colgan Air accident in 2009 and helicopter air ambulance operations. Our commercial safety record indicates the agency has successfully addressed the majority of known system hazards contributing to accidents or incidents. As we develop and deploy NextGen systems, the increased degree of complexity will require improved analytical methods and tools for evaluating the safety risks within this area of operation. The FAA works with aviation industry stakeholders to establish safety management systems within their operations. With these systems in place, the FAA and the aviation industry will work together to address risks. The Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST) is a joint industry/government group committed to improving aviation safety, focusing on detecting risk and implementing mitigation strategies before accidents or serious incidents occur. CAST has developed multiple safety enhancements and continues achieve positive results. The latest enhancements were based on the FAA’s pillar of Risk-Based Decision Making (RBDM) analysis of non-accident data, demonstrating the agency’s evolution from reactive safety enhancements to proactive risk mitigation and elimination.

&amp;nbsp;

General Aviation Fatal Accident Rate:

For the fourth quarter of FY15, the General Aviation fatal accident rate is 1.03. As of September 30, 2015 the rate was 1.03 versus a not-to-exceed (NTE) of 1.04 per 100,000 flight hours. This equates to 238 actual fatal accidents vs. a not-to-exceed of 239 for the quarter.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, there were 384 total fatalities for FY15. The General Aviation fatal accident not-to-exceed (NTE) target is based on estimates of flight hours at this time.

The FAA is working with industry to help reduce the GA accident rate. The General Aviation Joint Steering Committee (GAJSC) continues to take a data-driven approach to understand fatal accident causes and contributing factors. This government-industry group meets to review GA accident trends, establish areas for special emphasis, and share information. The GAJSC has developed 29 safety enhancements to address the number one cause of fatal accidents, which is loss of control during approach and landing. &amp;nbsp;In FY2015, GAJSC focused on the analysis of accidents related to system component and power plant failure. To date, 4 safety enhancements have been approved by the GAJSC in that focus area. In addition to the GAJSC, the FAA Administrator met with GA leaders from the general aviation community to agree on actions to enhance safety and reduce accidents, specifically in the area of in-flight loss of control. This meeting increased the awareness of the accident rate and requested that the industry carry the safety message to the general aviation community.&amp;nbsp; Finally, the FAA and industry launched the ‘Fly Safe’ national safety campaign to educate the GA community on how to prevent loss of control accidents.&amp;nbsp; Each month the campaign delivers focused messages highlighting key solutions to prevent loss of control based on technology, policies, training, and equipment.


	
		
			
			Runway Incursions (Categories A &amp;amp; B):

			Through the end of September 2015, the preliminary cumulative rate for category A &amp;amp; B runway incursions is 0.302 per million operations, which equates to less than one event per 2 million operations. &amp;nbsp;This rate is only slightly elevated when compared to the rate for the same time period last fiscal year and remains below our target rate of 0.395 per million operations.

			The FAA, using risk-based decision-making principals, is drawing on safety data to identify Runway Safety Focus Airports where the Agency can pursue runway safety improvements. The program identifies airports that require focused attention based on risk indicators such as runway incursions, excursions, plus potential or latent risk indicators such as airport design, management and operational changes.&amp;nbsp;

			The target for Runway Incursion (RI) Rate (Category A and B) is 0.395 per million operations. The September status is Green. Through September FY 2015, the preliminary cumulative rate for category A&amp;amp;B runway incursions is 0.302 per million operations. The revised cumulative rate for August is 0.308. Preliminary data indicates that this target has been achieved. DATA ARE PRELIMINARY AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE. DATA CURRENT AS 10/1/2015&quot;

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Improving transportation safety remains DOT’s top priority. Our goal is to bring a department-wide focus on reducing transportation-related fatalities and injuries. We will promote roadway safety for all users; combat distracted driving and other dangerous behaviors; implement a new Federal role in transit safety; and carry out strategies for addressing the most serious safety risks in other surface and aviation transportation modes.

</objective_statement><objective_overview>Based on current economic and demographic forecasts, it is likely that the movement of people and goods within the U.S. and abroad will continue to increase and the transportation sector will continue to enable economic growth and job creation.  The transportation sector contributed approximately $1.466 trillion, or 9.7 percent, to GDP in 2011.  Our Nation must make strategic investments that enable the movement of people and goods more efficiently with full utilization of the existing capacity across all transportation modes. The cornerstones of this strategy are investments in high-performance passenger rail, the development of a national freight strategy, investments in public transportation, mitigating traffic congestion on our highways, and implementing NextGen to improve operations and alleviate airport congestion.

</objective_statement><objective_overview>In 2011, 34,414 people died and more than 2.2 million people were injured in transportation-related crashes and accidents, according to U.S. DOT national Transportation Statistics.  Motor vehicle crashes caused 32,367 fatalities, or 94 percent of the total, even though the rate of fatalities per hundred million miles of travel was the lowest ever recorded in the United States.  Distracted driving was a contributing factor in at least 3,331 fatal crashes.  Another 1, 213 people died in rail, air, and transit accidents.  We will use our safety programs and regulations for automobiles, airplanes, railroads, trucks, motorcoaches, pipelines, and hazardous materials as effectively as possible to reduce crashes, fatalities, and injuries, and will expand safety oversight to public transit.  We will continue to direct federal resources to address the most serious safety risks and implement program reforms that will advance our safety mission. Between 2001 and 2010, an average of 13 people in the United States died every year in incidents related to the transportation of hazardous material—a rate of one death for every 21 billion ton-miles of hazardous material moved.  In addition to causing deaths and injuries, hazardous material transportation incidents disrupt communities when people are evacuated from their homes, business activity is curtailed, and transportation services are interrupted.  We will continue to develop and encourage the use of safety tools - such as improved data collection, risk management practices, and incident response planning - to prevent, mitigate, and respond to hazardous material transportation accidents.
