</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>The FY13 baseline number for Disaster Loan Application Return Rate was 24%, so the goal for FY14 is to achieve 29% and 34% in FY15.&amp;nbsp; Increasing the application return rate will improve the delivery of the Disaster Loan Program. The primary opportunity being addressed is that a higher application return rate should result in a greater number of disaster survivors that will apply for disaster loan assistance and receive much needed Federal disaster assistance. SBA’s plan to increase the application return rate also ensures that SBA's disaster assistance resources for businesses, non-profit organizations, homeowners, and renters can be deployed quickly, effectively and efficiently in order to preserve jobs and help return small businesses to operation.

SBA’s plan to increase the application return rate will indirectly make the Disaster Loan Program more efficient by: 1) saving costs on mailing application packets to 100% of disaster survivors referred to SBA; and 2) freeing up resources dedicated to preparing and mailing application packets that can be utilized in other critical areas of the application screening process that directly impact processing times.

In all fiscal quarters except one from FY 2014 through FY 2015, the SBA increased the disaster loan application return rate, going from 24% at the end of FY 2013 to 98% at&amp;nbsp;the end of FY 2015.&amp;nbsp; The SBA improved disaster assistance by integrating user-friendly technology and streamlining the loan application process.&amp;nbsp; For example, the electronic loan application rate increased to 84 percent in FY 2015, more than tripling the rate from FY 2011.&amp;nbsp; The SBA is continually reviewing and implementing process improvements to enhance program delivery and improve the customer experience.&amp;nbsp; For example, the electronic loan application (ELA) for disaster assistance loans has simplified the loan application process, speeding delivery of assistance to eligible disaster survivors and improving the integrity of data used in the underwriting process via the Disaster Credit Management System (DCMS). Also, SBA established approximate loan processing time standards based on tiered levels of application volumes (from less than 50,000 applications to more than 500,000 applications) which will help SBA better manage customer expectations based on the level of disaster activity.

&amp;nbsp;SBA’s new process for issuing applications in Presidential-IA declarations helped increase the application return rate and improves customer service by adding multiple touch points with disaster survivors. &amp;nbsp;SBA's priority goal strategy has also resulted in reduced mailing costs and savings of $145,000.
</progress_update><themes><theme>Community and Regional Development</theme></themes><contributing_programs_and_other_factors>The SBA’s Office of Disaster Assistance (ODA) administers the Disaster Loan Program, one of the Agency’s main tools for helping drive economic recovery for local communities following a disaster. This goal emphasizes the importance of efficient delivery and high quality service in lending to small business owners (up to $2 million for physical damages and/or economic injury) and residents (up to $200,000 for real estate damages and $40,000 personal property losses) following a disaster.&amp;nbsp; These critical dollars provide a foundation for reestablishing and growing local and/or regional economies.&amp;nbsp; The Disaster Loan Program is the only SBA loan program directly administered by the agency itself; not through a bank or credit union.

ODA will work with the Office of Communication and Public Liaison (OCPL) to develop messaging to the disaster survivors.&amp;nbsp; We will work with the Office of Field Operations through District and Regional offices to get the message out to disaster survivors.&amp;nbsp; In partnership with the Office of Entrepreneurial Development, ODA will work with its resource partners, i.e. Small Business Development Centers (SBDC), Women’s Business Centers (WBC) and SCORE, to distribute information about the SBA Disaster Loan Program and encourage disaster survbivors to apply.

External Stakeholder:&amp;nbsp; The Office of Disaster Assistance will receive an electronic file from FEMA containing of the contact information for disaster victims that may be eligible for SBA disaster loan.
