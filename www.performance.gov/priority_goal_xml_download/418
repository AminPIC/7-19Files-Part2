</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Providing access to capital has been one of the SBA’s critical strategies in meeting its objective to drive business formation, job growth and economic expansion particularly in underserved markets since the agency was created in 1953. By providing loan guarantees to reduce lenders’ loss exposure, the SBA provides an important credit lifeline to small businesses, especially startup businesses and businesses owned by women, minorities, veterans and other underserved groups who often cannot easily obtain credit in the&amp;nbsp; conventional market.&amp;nbsp; In the current economic conditions, SBA loan programs become even more crucial for ensuring that small businesses are not only surviving but also leading the way toward economic recovery and growth, as they have done time-and-time again throughout U.S. history.

SBA will increase small business access to capital by increasing the number of new or returning lenders in the fiscal year for the flagship 7(a) program (including the Community Advantage pilot program). New and returning lenders are a major component of SBA’s lending portfolio and are essential to growth in the quantity of loans approved and small businesses assisted. Each new or returning lender will expand SBA’s footprint and increase small business access to capital. Attaining a high volume of new and returning lenders from one fiscal year to the next will create a consistent pipeline of SBA loans into the hands of small business.

There are barriers and challenges to the SBA in achieving its priority goals:


	Economic Trends; micro and macro
	Issues within the Finance Industry as a whole
	Shrinking workforce in field offices which provide training
	Recent cases from the OIG reviewing SBA lenders underwriting criteria have triggered a more cautious approach from some lenders with some loan guaranty types

The priority goal to increase new and returning lenders has reduced the decline from FY 2012 to FY 2014.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

While the number of new and returning lenders&amp;nbsp;is under target, the dollars of loans approved for 7(a) loans exceeded the FY 2015 goal. &amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;SBA's 7(a) loan program increased by 23% from previous fiscal year, leading to a record year of approvals. &amp;nbsp;This priority&amp;nbsp;goal has helped expand SBA’s footprint to increase small business access to capital. &amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;SBA lending community has been very responsive to SBA’s strategy of fee relief and loan program improvement. &amp;nbsp;Actions taken to reverse the downward trend:


	Guaranty and servicing fees have been waived for all loans less than $150,000 (Effective 10/1/13 and extended through FY 2015)
	Guaranty and servicing fees have been waived for all SBAEXP loans to veterans less than $350,000 (Effective 1/1/14 and extended through FY 2015)
	50% of the upfront guaranty fees have been waived for all other loans to veterans (Effective 10/1/14)
	SBA issued SOP 50 10 5(g) to describe new rules and better clarify existing policy for lenders. &amp;nbsp;This SOP eliminates the personal resource test and clarifies SBA policy for several issues including eligibility, credit standard, collateral, and environmental. (Effective 10/1/14)
	SBA issued notice that it would accept electronic signatures for all SBA loan documents. (Effective 1/1/15)
	SBA issued SOP 50 10 5(h) to clarify policies regarding debt refinancing, update appraisal requirements, and simplify the process for delegated lenders to obtain loan increases and decreases.
	SBA entered into MOUs with credit union associations that are committing to join forces with the SBA to provide more loans to small businesses
	Announced MOUs&amp;nbsp;in three events in February with follow-up&amp;nbsp; communication and training from Field and OCA with credit unions
	LINC (lead generator) was implemented connecting lenders with borrowers

</objective_statement><objective_overview>Access to capital is critical to the long-term success of America’s small businesses.  The top priority at the SBA is to get lending flowing to small businesses.  As the economy continues to improve, the SBA is working to ensure that remaining gaps in the commercial markets are filled and that small businesses across the country are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities.  The SBA also continues to streamline and simplify its loan programs to make its products more attractive to lenders and borrowers.

</objective_statement><objective_overview>Export sales contribute to a strong middle class by fueling economic opportunity and jobs in communities across the United States, while the countries buying American products gain access to some of the highest-quality products and services in the world.  Today, nearly 96 percent of consumers and over two-thirds of the world's purchasing power reside outside the United States.  Small businesses that can tap into this global market have the potential for vast expansion and growth, with small businesses now constituting 34 percent of total export dollars and comprising approximately 97.8 percent of all exporters.

</objective_statement><objective_overview>Underserved communities – including women, low-income, minorities, veteran entrepreneurs – often have extreme difficulty in accessing capital, training, advising, and mentoring services and federal contracts.  SBA’s unique approach to inclusive entrepreneurship provides products, services and programs that offer a path to business ownership for these populations that also suffer from disproportionately high levels of unemployment.  The SBA will continue to work collaboratively with community development partners, credit unions, minority associations and others to tailor programs to meet their needs and ensure that SBA’s programs remain accessible to underserved communities.
