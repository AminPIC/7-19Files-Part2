[1]&amp;nbsp;In addition to the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and other territories are candidates for implementing these assessments.


</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>GOAL OVERVIEW

The adoption of college- and career-ready standards is the foundation to improving educational outcomes for all students and a fundamental step toward meeting the President’s goal of once again having the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020.&amp;nbsp; The college- and career-ready standards must be coupled with high-quality aligned assessments to measure the extent to which students are mastering the standards.

&amp;nbsp;

KEY BARRIERS AND CHALLENGES

A key challenge facing the Department of Education (ED) over the next two years &amp;nbsp;relates to the changes States may make to their currently adopted college- and career-ready standards due to changes from state leadership or the state legislature. Another key challenge is supporting states with the implementation of their college- and career-ready aligned assessments for all students, including English Learners, students with disabilities, economically disadvantaged and low-achieving students to ensure that all students are prepared for post-secondary success.&amp;nbsp;

ED is taking steps to address these challenges by developing and targeting technical assistance activities that will, in part, increase state capacity to leverage limited resources and continue to identify promising practices across multiple states.&amp;nbsp; First, ED has released its Title I assessment peer review guidance, which &amp;nbsp;highlights the requirements for a high-quality assessment to help support state assessment development; in FY 2016, ED will begin conducting peer review of state assessment systems, providing examples of promising and best practices in the field. &amp;nbsp;ED will build also library of resources to assist SEAs in full and effective transition to college- and career-ready standards, leveraging work that has occurred during Race to the Top with other partner organizations such as Achieve, Student Achievement Partners, PTA, and others. In addition, ED is working internally to coordinate the provision of technical assistance across OESE, the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP), and other related offices and programs.&amp;nbsp; ED also funds a Center on Standards and Assessments Implementation (part of the ESEA Comprehensive Centers program) that helps build the capacity of State educational agencies to implement college- and career-ready standards.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

Finally, ED is working with states to provide communication support and technical assistance to help states and LEAs reduce redundant and unaligned local assessments, as well as to help states develop a process and strategy to share state assessment results from 2014-2015 as scores are likely to drop due to increased rigor of the assessments. Among other activities, this includes assisting states in resetting baselines and annual goals related to student performance.

&amp;nbsp;

EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS

ED consistently engaged with Congress, advocacy organizations, education organizations, State educational agencies and other external stakeholders regarding Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) flexibility, including state plans for transitioning to and implementing college- and career-ready standards.&amp;nbsp; ED has met with stakeholders to provide information on state plans, as well as to enlist external support and technical assistance for states and districts as they move forward with implementing the new standards.

	All States with ESEA flexibility (42 States, DC and Puerto Rico), including those not participating in PARCC or Smarter Balanced, developed and implemented an assessment system aligned to the State’s college- and career-ready standards in 2014-2015, primarily during FY 2015 Q3.
	Race to the Top - Assessment (RTTA) consortia and consortia that are developing alternate assessments based on alternate achievement standards completed the field testing of their assessments during the 2013-2014 school year and successfully implemented the first full administration in spring 2015.
	29 states, DC, and the US Virgin Islands participated in the Partnerships for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC) and Smarter Balanced (the two RTTA consortia) first operational administration in spring 2015.
	ED’s monitoring of Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) flexibility for the 41 states, DC, and Puerto Rico that were approved in windows 1, 2, 3 and 4, examined progress in implementing college- and career-ready standards and assessments.
	In Q1 of 2015 (fall 2014), ED released guidance related to the ESEA flexibility renewal process, which will support State progress toward implementation of college- and career-ready standards and high-quality aligned assessments.
	As of September 30, 2015, ED had approved ESEA flexibility requests for 39 states, DC and Puerto Rico. All states, DC, and Puerto Rico that are eligible for renewal (Illinois is not eligible until after the 2015-2016 school year, when its current waivers expire), as well as one new state (Nebraska), submitted renewal requests during FY 2015. &amp;nbsp;
	In FY 2015, ED completed a reorganization within the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education by creating the new Office of State Support that combines the Office of Student Achievement and School Accountability, the Office of School Turnaround, and the Implementation and Support Unit, as well as several programs from other offices.&amp;nbsp; This new office will enable OESE to provide better and more differentiated support for States on their implementation of key reform efforts, including implementation of college- and career-ready standards and high-quality aligned assessments.&amp;nbsp;
	
	ED used the ESEA flexibility renewal process in quarters 3 and 4&amp;nbsp;to support states’ continued efforts toward implementing college- and career-ready standards and high-quality aligned assessments.&amp;nbsp; Throughout FY 2015 and FY 2016, ED will continue to explore strategies to support for states and districts in implementing college- and career-ready standards.&amp;nbsp; ED will also continue to implement its monitoring processes for OSS programs, including ESEA flexibility, to provide feedback on state implementation of college- and career-ready standards and assessments.&amp;nbsp; ED will ensure that where monitoring has identified challenges in implementation, states address these challenges.
	
	
	In Q4, ED &amp;nbsp;disseminated revised criteria and process for ED’s peer review of state assessment systems under Title I of the ESEA and began providing guidance &amp;nbsp;technical assistance to support all states, not just those with waivers under ESEA flexibility, in preparing for peer review. ED will begin peer review of each State’s system during FY 2016.
	
	
	ED will work with internal and external partners to provide States and districts with communication support and technical assistance to reduce redundant and unaligned local assessments, as well as to help states develop a process and strategy to share state assessment results from 2014-2015 as scores are likely to drop due to increased rigor of the assessments.&amp;nbsp;
	
	Because a significant number of States are changing assessments between the SY 2014-2015 and SY 2015-2016, this goal will be maintained in FY 2016 and FY 2017.

</contributing_programs_and_other_factors></Agency_Priority_Goal><Strategic_Goals><Strategic_Goal><id>500</id><strategic_goal_header>Elementary and Secondary Education</strategic_goal_header><strategic_goal_statement>Improve the elementary and secondary education system’s ability to consistently deliver excellent instruction aligned with rigorous academic standards while providing effective support services to close achievement and opportunity gaps, and ensure all students graduate high school college- and career-ready.
</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>The goal for America’s educational system is clear: every student should graduate from high school ready for college and a career.  Every student should have meaningful opportunities from which to choose upon graduation from high school.  Over the past few years, states, districts, and schools have initiated groundbreaking reforms and innovations to try to meet this goal.  For the first time, almost every state is supporting higher standards that will demonstrate that students are truly college- and career-ready. States are also coming together to develop the next generation of assessments that are not only aligned with these new standards but also advance essential skills that promote critical thinking, problem solving, and the application of knowledge.  At the same time, states, districts, and schools are working to meet the challenges of putting a highly-qualified teacher in every classroom and a strong and effective leader in every school; building local capacity to support successful school turnarounds; redesigning high school education by building stronger connections among secondary education, postsecondary education, and the workplace; and improving teacher preparation and classroom instruction in STEM education.
 
But, while many schools are increasing the quality of instruction and improving academic achievement, there is also broad agreement that the U.S. education system fails to consistently provide all students with the excellent education necessary to achieve college- and career-readiness.  The result is that too many U.S. students are failing to reach their full potential. Recent National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) scores show that low-income students are “roughly two years of learning behind the average better-off student of the same age.” Also, according to the 2009 McKinsey report The Economic Impact of the Achievement Gap in America’s Schools, on average, “black and Latino students are roughly two to three years of learning behind white students of the same age.”
 
Many children, particularly low-income children, students with disabilities, English learners, and children of color confront not only an achievement gap but also an opportunity gap. Today, a student in a school with high minority enrollment is much less likely to go to a school that offers calculus and physics than a student in a high school with low minority enrollment. Less than 8 percent of students taking Advanced Placement (AP) mathematics or AP science courses today are African American. Closing the opportunity gap will require that school resources, talent, and spending be targeted to the kids who need help the most.
 
The Department’s elementary and secondary education reforms focus on the building blocks needed for schools, school districts, and states to more consistently deliver excellent classroom instruction for all students. The foundation of these reforms is a system for improving learning and teaching that aligns with internationally benchmarked college- and career-ready standards, high-quality formative and summative assessments, and engaging and effective instructional content.  Ensuring that U.S. students have the critical thinking skills and other tools they need to be effective in the 21st-century economy means improving teaching and learning in all content areas—from literacy, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to history, civics and government, geography, foreign languages, the arts, economics and financial literacy, environmental education, computer science, health education, and other subjects.
 
Highly important to student success is the creation of a sustainable collaborative relationship between labor and management. Increasing student achievement and improving student outcomes while effectively implementing college- and career-ready standards can be a direct result of effective labor-management collaboration. Since 2009, the Department has worked closely with national labor-management partners to support states and districts in building their capacity for collaboration in an effort to improve teaching, learning, and instructional content.  Strong labor-management collaboration can be a bridge to success rather than a barrier.
 
A strong reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA)that reinforces and extends the progress already being made to strengthen the quality of elementary and secondary education would further this goal.
How will we measure success?  
 
The Department will use the following indicators to measure its success in helping states and school districts deliver excellent instruction that is aligned with rigorous standards while ensuring effective support services that help students graduate college- and career-ready.
 
Elementary and Secondary Education Indicators of Success
 
Increase number of states that have adopted college- and career-ready standards
Increase number of states that are implementing next-generation assessments, aligned with college- and career-ready standards
Increase number of states that have fully implemented teacher and principal evaluation and support systems that consider multiple measures of effectiveness, with student growth as a significant factor
Decrease use of out-of-school suspensions, expulsions, and alternative school placements and reduce disparities in the rates these sanctions are applied to students with disabilities and youths of color
Decrease number of high schools with low graduation rates
Increase percentage of priority schools that have met the state exit criteria and exited priority school status
Increase percentage of focus schools that have met the state exit criteria and exited focus school status
Increase number of postsecondary STEM credentials awarded
Increase percentage of teachers who teach STEM as their main assignment and who hold a corresponding undergraduate degree
Increase number of public high school graduates who have taken at least one STEM Advanced Placement exam
What could hold us back?  What’s beyond our control?  (External Risk Factors)
 
States are moving forward in implementing important reforms to increase student achievement, close achievement gaps, and improve the quality of instruction.  Yet, efforts to implement college- and career-ready standards and new, aligned assessments, to acquire higher-quality instructional materials, and to develop and implement teacher and school leader evaluation systems have run up against resource limitations.  Developing and administering the next generation of assessments and supporting teachers and leaders through training related to the new standards will require continuing financial support, in addition to expert technical assistance, in order to help states tackle these new and complex reforms in a manner tailored to their unique needs. Similarly, states face challenges in turning around a large number of our lowest-performing schools, and in sustaining growth and improvement as grant funding declines. Finally, the pace of reforms may be dictated in part by future Congressional appropriations and the extent to which the reauthorization of ESEA requires rigorous interventions in each state’s lowest-achieving schools.
 
In the current economic climate, student needs often are growing while school budgets are contracting. Expanding services and supports to address students’ mental, emotional, and behavioral health, and to create positive school environments where all students can learn and excel will be a challenge. Cross-agency collaboration helps to connect agency programs and leverage community assets, but additional resources are needed to bring to scale effective school-based practices that support students struggling with trauma and poverty, improve student behavior, and increase campus safety.
 
To achieve the STEM goals, there needs to be improved coordination among federal agencies. In addition, high-quality, STEM-specific technical assistance is needed to address the limited capacity of some states and school districts to lead STEM-related programs. Finally, more states and districts must adopt rigorous STEM standards that will prepare students to succeed in these fields at the postsecondary level.
