</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>GOAL OVERVIEW

Kindergarten entry assessments (KEAs), when properly designed, can be used to inform professional development to improve the early learning workforce, be included in a State’s comprehensive early learning assessment system, and improve student achievement and program effectiveness. KEAs can inform instruction and support students’ educational success by identifying the early learning needs of each child.&amp;nbsp; They provide an opportunity for teachers and families to understand the status of children when they enter Kindergarten and policy makers to decide if there is a greater need to invest in high-quality early learning programs to ensure children enter school prepared for success.

&amp;nbsp;

KEY BARRIERS AND CHALLENGES

Assessment in early learning is new and untested.&amp;nbsp; Many States are starting from scratch developing valid and reliable measures for KEAs.&amp;nbsp; Constructing and testing these instruments and implementing them across every school in the State will be challenging and will take time.&amp;nbsp; In addition, states will need to ensure that the KEAs are implemented in a balanced way that does not result in the loss of a significant amount of instructional time. Additionally, two of the three Enhanced Assessment Grants (EAG) grantees that are consortia may experience challenges coordinating across states due to differences in their policies and procedures. Preschool Development Gants (PDG) States are required to report on the status of children in kindergarten served by the grants in the high-need communities, but they are not required to use a KEA, and funding may be a challenge.&amp;nbsp; The U.S. Department of Education (ED), along with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is working with these grantees to minimize these coordination challenges.

&amp;nbsp;

EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS

ED regularly engages external early learning stakeholders, with specific attention to HHS and Congress.

	When the Department first set this goal in 2010, Child Trends reported that only two states were implementing KEAs across multiple domains and collecting and reporting disaggregated data: Maryland and Minnesota (http://www.childtrends.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2010-14-SchoolReadinessStates.pdf ).
	The Department set this goal without any legislative requirement nor any programs that supported or incentivized KEAS.&amp;nbsp; Over the years, the Department has made awards to 20 states for Race to the Top-Early Learning Challenge; 18 states for Preschool Development Grants; and 3 cohorts encompassing 29 states. Each of the grant programs support enhancement implementation of KEAs.
	Today, the department has surpassed the September 30, 2015 goal of 9 states collecting and reporting disaggregated data on the status of children at kindergarten entry using a common measure. Eleven RTT-ELC states (CA, CO, DE, KY, MD, MA, MI, NC, OH, OR, and VT) are implementing their KEAs in the 2015-16 school year. &amp;nbsp;The remaining eight states that chose to implement KEAs (GA, IL, MN, NJ, NM, PA, RI, WA) will begin after the 2015-16 school year.&amp;nbsp; Wisconsin did not select to implement a KEA, but is implementing a statewide literacy assessment and is exploring the development and use of a KEA.
	The RTT-ELC annual state reports released on October 27, 2015 &amp;nbsp;highlight how states are engaging stakeholders in improving KEA development and implementation by providing professional development to teachers and evaluating what is &amp;nbsp;and is not working.. http://www2.ed.gov/programs/preschooldevelopmentgrants/index.html?src=rotator
	The 18 PDG States are required to report on the school readiness of the children participating in their high-quality preschool programs, with strong encouragement to use a KEA. Note this is only for the children funded through the PGD programs and not all children in the state. We expect to have this data in Spring, 2017 for the second year of the grant.
	Texas and two state consortia, one led by Maryland and the other led by North Carolina, continue to make progress under the Enhanced Assessment Grants (EAG) program, which supports 29 states in the development and enhancement of KEAs. Three ELC grantees are participating in the Maryland consortium (Massachusetts, Michigan, and Ohio) as well as Connecticut, Indiana, and Nevada. Eight states are partnering with North Carolina: Delaware, Iowa, Maine, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Washington, DC.
	On April 7, 2015, ELC TA cohosted a webinar with CEELO and the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) focusing on the essential elements of a comprehensive assessment system, promising implementation strategies, key capacity-building considerations, and tools that can support this work at the State level.
	On June 6, 2015, ELC TA held the National Working Meeting on Early Learning Assessment in New Orleans, Louisiana. The one-day working meeting provided states with the opportunity to work together to address persistent problems associated with the implementation of comprehensive early learning assessment systems with a specific focus on child assessments, including KEAs.
	In August, 2015 ELC TA released a brief, Statewide KEA Data Collection and Reporting in RTT-ELC States, in response to a request from a RTT-ELC State for information about issues that need to be considered in planning and implementing a statewide KEA data collection and reporting system.&amp;nbsp; The report includes information on practices in five RTT-ELC states (Kentucky, Maryland, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Washington). https://elc.grads360.org/#communities/pdc/documents/8715
	Materials for the June 6, 2015 National Working Meeting on Early Learning Assessment, held in New Orleans, LA, have been posted on the ELC TA website. The one-day working meeting provided states with the opportunity to work together to address persistent problems associated with the implementation of comprehensive early learning assessment systems, with a specific focus on child assessment, including KEAs. https://elc.grads360.org/#program/national-working-meeting-on-early-learning-assessment
	In Q4, ED and HHS staff worked with ELC TA to update their Kindergarten Entry Assessments in RTT-ELC States report, now posted at https://elc.grads360.org/services/PDCService.svc/GetPDCDocumentFile?fileId=15013. This summary, updated from two previous reports, provides an overview of the assessment instruments currently in use or being developed. It details which States are collaborating on KEA development, provides information on the time frames for developing and conducting the assessments, and provides links to KEA homepages across the States. In September, 2015, ELC TA posted the recorded webinar, presentation slides, and a brief from their April 7, 2015 webinar, cohosted by the Center on Enhancing Early Learning Outcomes (CEELO), and the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO), focused on the essential elements of a comprehensive assessment system, promising implementation strategies, key capacity-building considerations, and tools that can support this work at the State level. https://elc.grads360.org/#communities/pdc/documents/9048
	The Departments are using national activities funds to develop case studies of four states’ approaches to KEAs through ED’s Office of Planning, Evaluation and Policy Development Policy and Program Studies Service (PPSS).&amp;nbsp;In Spring 2015, SRI, contracted by PPSS, conducted interviews with representatives and professional development providers in 4 states.&amp;nbsp; Within each state, SRI visited 3 school districts and 2 elementary schools in each districts, speaking with district-level officials, principals, elementary teachers, and preschool staff.
	Given the progress on this APG and the supports deployed, the Department has decided to focus on a new APG beginning in FY 2016 that better aligns with its current focus of expanding access to high-quality preschool.&amp;nbsp; This aligns with ED’s Strategic Objective 3.1: Access to High-Quality Programs and Services – Increase access to high-quality early learning programs and comprehensive services, especially for children with high needs.
	The new APG will be to increase the percentage of children, especially children from low-income families, enrolled in high-quality preschool programs.&amp;nbsp; By September 30, 2017, the percentage of four-year old children enrolled in state preschool programs will increase to 33% (from 29% in 2015). By September 30, 2017, the number of state preschool programs meeting high-quality benchmarks will increase to 19 states (from 17 in 2015).
	The Department will continue to support the development and implementation of KEAs and highlight best practices through its technical assistance centers and grant monitoring.&amp;nbsp;
	By 2017, the EAG grantees and their consortia states will begin implementing their school readiness assessments.
	Data on school readiness from the 20 ELC and 18 PDG states will be available in Spring, 2016.&amp;nbsp;
	For SY16-17, SY17-18, and SY18-19, states will be asked to provide &amp;nbsp;KEA Data Collection through EMAPS as part of the Annual Mandatory Collection of Elementary and Secondary Education Data through EDFacts.
	The new Preschool through Early Elementary School Grades (Network), administered by the National Center for Education Research (NCER) at the Institute for Education Sciences (IES) and funded in part through PDG national activities funds, will support teams of researchers to advance the field's understanding of policies and practices that support early learning and ongoing academic success.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In addition to their funded research activity in conducting three prospective studies, these research teams will work with the Network Lead on a new classroom quality observation tool.&amp;nbsp; Each team will support the development of the tool and pilot-test it.&amp;nbsp; Awards will be made in December, 2015 and the Network will begin in June, 2016.
	Educating Testing Service (ETS), Education Commission of the States (ECS), the National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER), and CCSSO will continue to collect and report information on the states’ progress in implementing KEAs.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>The foundation of a thriving middle class is a strong education. But millions of children in this country can’t reach the first rung on the ladder of opportunity because they are cut off from access to high-quality early learning experiences. The first years of a child’s life are the most critical for brain development,[1] and strong and consistent evidence from research and evaluation demonstrate that participation in high-quality early learning programs can lead to both short- and long-term positive outcomes for children from both low-income and middle-class families.[2], [3]   Research finds that high-quality preschool programs can serve as effective early intervention programs for children with special needs[4] and provide significant benefits to English Learners.[5]  Study after study shows the benefits of high-quality early learning, including increased school readiness, lower rates of retention and special education placements, improved high school graduation, and higher rates of college attendance and completion.[6]
 
Children from low-income families, on average, start kindergarten 12 to 14 months behind their peers in pre-reading and language skills.[7] Results from the “Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010–11,” indicate scores on reading and math were lowest for kindergartners in households with incomes below the federal poverty level and highest for those in households with incomes at or above 200 percent of the federal poverty level.[8]  Additionally, children with a primary home language of English scored higher in reading and math than those coming from homes with a primary home language other than English.  High-quality early learning provides the foundation for children's success in school and helps to mitigate educational gaps that exist for children with high-needs before they enter kindergarten. By increasing access to high-quality early learning programs and services, the country can work to close, or even prevent, the achievement gap.
 
The Obama administration is committed to closing that unjust gap through one of the boldest proposed expansions of early learning opportunities in a generation.  The signature program in this effort is Preschool for All, a groundbreaking new federal-state partnership that would provide voluntary, high-quality preschool to all 4-year-olds from low- and moderate-income families.  The program would also create incentives for states to expand publicly funded preschool to middle-class families above 200 percent of the federal poverty level, and promote access to high-quality full-day kindergarten and early learning programs for children under the age of 4. The administration is also proposing Preschool Development Grants to support state efforts to establish the infrastructure for high-quality preschool. This will enable more states with preschool systems at various stages of development to provide universal access to high-quality preschool for 4-year-old children from low- and moderate-income families. President Obama’s Preschool for All proposal is a key part of the administration’s overall strategy to provide all children with the high-quality foundation that will prepare them for success in school and in life. As part of this strategy, the administration is also proposing Early Head Start-Child Care Partnerships in the Department of Health and Humans Services (HHS) to improve the quality of early learning programs for infants and toddlers, and expanding HHS’s voluntary evidence-based home visiting services. In addition, the administration has proposed an increase in funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Part C program to continue to support high-quality services for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families.
 
These quality early learning efforts build on significant work from the administration’s first term and ongoing federal investments in programs serving young children, including over $5 billion invested in early childhood programs through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), as well as Race to the Top – Early Learning Challenge (RTT-ELC), a program jointly administered by ED and HHS. The program has rewarded states that have agreed to raise the bar on the quality of their early learning programs, establish higher standards, and provide critical links with health, nutrition, mental health, and family support.  RTT-ELC states serve as model early learning and development systems, and are part of a national technical assistance strategy to reach all states. Only by coordinating the patchwork of early learning programs and services, and better integrating them with the elementary and secondary education system, can an integrated early learning system be built that improves health, social-emotional, and cognitive outcomes for children from birth through third grade. A high-quality, coordinated early learning system includes program standards, comprehensive assessment systems, workforce and professional development systems, family and community engagement, health promotion, and data systems.
 
In supporting the alignment of these systems, the administration will focus its efforts on improving outcomes for children with high needs by ensuring that they have access to high-quality early learning programs with demonstrated success in closing achievement gaps and reducing grade retention rates in later years. To enhance the quality of these programs and services, and improve outcomes for children from birth through third grade, including children with disabilities and those who are English learners, the Department will promote initiatives that increase access to high-quality, effective programs, improve the quality of the early childhood workforce, and support comprehensive assessment systems.
How will we measure success?  
The Department will use the following indicators to measure its success in improving the health, social-emotional, and cognitive outcomes for all children from birth through third grade, particularly those with high needs, to ensure they are on track for graduating from high school college- and career-ready.
 
Early Learning Indicators of Success
Increase the number of states with Quality Rating and Improvement Systems (QRIS) that meet high quality benchmarks for child care and other early childhood programs
Increase the number of states and territories with professional development systems that include core knowledge and competencies, career pathways, professional development capacity assessments, accessible professional development opportunities, and financial supports for child care provider
Increase the number of states collecting and reporting disaggregated data on the status of children at kindergarten entry using a common measure
What could hold us back?  What’s beyond our control?  (External Risk Factors)
The president’s proposal would provide the biggest increase for early education in this century. But it will require a bipartisan commitment from Congress to invest in our future and a belief by all Americans in the urgency of acting now.  In 1971, Congress enacted a law that provided free, universal access to early childhood services and child care for children from low-income families. President Nixon vetoed that law. In the 42 long years since then, the evidence that high-quality early learning works has multiplied many times over. But the U.S. meanwhile has fallen far behind high-achieving countries in the provision of high-quality early learning.
Our plan to expand access to high-quality programs and services, improve the competencies of early childhood educators, and promote statewide comprehensive assessment systems will require a bold commitment from the federal government with additional authorization and appropriations from Congress.  Additionally, significant coordination with HHS, state and local agencies, schools, community-based providers, early childhood stakeholders, postsecondary institutions, and other professional development providers will be required.  But the investment in high-quality early learning can fundamentally change the outcomes in children’s lives. Those who attend such programs have fewer special needs as they move through school; they get better jobs; they achieve better health; they commit fewer crimes. In turn, our nation will benefit, becoming more prosperous and globally competitive.
