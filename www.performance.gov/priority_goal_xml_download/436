The health of mothers and children around the world is linked to improvements in maternal health, which inherently affect child health. Over the past two decades, there has been a nearly 50 percent reduction in maternal deaths, from 543,000 in 1990 to 287,000 in 2010. Meanwhile, the annual number of under-five deaths declined from 12.6 million in 1990 to 6.6 million in 2012. While under-five mortality is declining faster now than in the past two decades, with the annual rate of reduction more than tripling in 2005-2012 compared to the rate in 1990-1995, 18,000 children still die every day. The U.S. cannot act alone and in order to meet the Millennium Development Goal Four (Reduce Child Mortality) target by its agreed date of 2015, an additional 3.5 million children's lives above the current trend rate will need to be saved between 2013 and 2015.

USAID, with its partners in the U.S. Government and the global community, is committed to the goal of ending preventable child and maternal deaths (EPCMD).&amp;nbsp; All women deserve to give birth safely, and all children — no matter where they are born — deserve the same chance to survive and thrive.&amp;nbsp; For the first time in history, there exist the tools, technologies, and approaches to end extreme poverty and its most devastating effects – including widespread hunger and preventable child death – within two decades.&amp;nbsp; USAID focuses efforts on the set of 24 priority countries that account for nearly 70 percent of child deaths worldwide.&amp;nbsp;

Over fiscal years (FY) 2014-2015 USAID met or exceeded all but one of its two-year targets for its six indicators for the Global Health Agency Priority Goal (APG) for EPCMD.

USAID continues to mobilize international action through evidence-based interventions to address major health challenged facing women and children.&amp;nbsp; USAID priority countries experienced a decline in the absolute change in under-five mortality (U5MR) rate of 2.0 deaths per 1,000 live births in FY 2014 (meeting the target of 2.0) and 1.7 deaths per 1,000 live births in FY 2015 ( which is significant, sustained, progress though falling short of the target of 2.0). A major component of EPCMD is ensuring access to and use of family planning contraceptives. &amp;nbsp;By enabling women and couples to practice healthy timing and spacing of pregnancies and providing family planning commodities, family planning could reduce maternal deaths by 30 percent and child deaths by 25 percent globally.&amp;nbsp; For USAID’s quarterly indicator percent of shipments of contraceptive commodities that are on time, USAID exceeded the target six out of eight quarters, met the target once, and fell short of the target once.&amp;nbsp; In FY 2014, USAID exceeded the target of 90 percent, averaging 90.75 percent over the four quarters. &amp;nbsp;In FY 2015, USAID exceeded the target of 90 percent with an average of 93.5 percent.

An important component of saving the lives of women during and around childbirth is ensuring skilled health professionals attend all births. &amp;nbsp;Timely management and treatment are needed to address the causes of maternal mortality, including severe bleeding, high blood pressure, and infection.&amp;nbsp; USAID exceeded its targets for the percentage of births attended by a skilled doctor, nurse of midwife (SBA) by 7.5 percent in FY 2014 and 2.1 percent in FY 2015.

The Annual total percentage of children who received DPT3 (diphtheria, pertussis [whooping cough] and tetanus) by 12 months of age exceeded the target in both years, increasing from 74.5 percent in FY 2014 (with a target of 61.1 percent) to 80 percent in FY 2015 (with a target of 75.0 percent).&amp;nbsp; For full protection, the series of DPT vaccine require a child to receive three doses at various time points before their first birthday.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, DPT3 coverage serves as a gauge of how well countries are providing immunization coverage for their children, providing an important indicator of USAID’s priority goal of EPCMD in the 24 priority countries.

Children under five years of age are one of most vulnerable groups affected by malaria.&amp;nbsp; The President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI) PMI includes 19 focus countries in Africa and one regional program in the Greater Mekong sub-region.&amp;nbsp; PMI coordinates its procurement and distribution of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) with other major donors including the Global Fund, the World Bank, and UNICEF.&amp;nbsp; ITNs are a proven and highly effective malaria prevention and treatment measure.&amp;nbsp; For the indicator annual total number of people protected against malaria with insecticide treated nets, USAID’s malaria project surpassed its target in FY 2014 and FY 2015, protecting 89 million people against malaria in FY 2014 (target of 45 million) and 72 million in FY 2015 (target of 50 million).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

Increased contraceptive use leads to decreases in unintended pregnancies and abortion rates and slows population growth over time.&amp;nbsp; The indicator absolute change in modern contraceptive prevalence rate (MCPR) measures the percentage of in-union women of reproductive age (15-49 years) using, or whose partner is using, a modern method of contraception at the time of the survey.&amp;nbsp; In FY 2014, USAID met its target of 1.0 percentage point increase in MCPR across the USAID-assisted 24 priority countries.&amp;nbsp; In FY 2015, USAID achieved a 1.3 percentage point increase, exceeding the target of 1.0.&amp;nbsp;

In addition, USAID completed all Global Health milestones, including the joint USAID, World Bank, and World Health Organization Summit.&amp;nbsp; In June 2015, USAID, the World Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO) convened a global summit on Measurement and Accountability for Results in Health, bringing together decision makers and thought leaders representing governments, multilateral agencies and civil society. &amp;nbsp;The Summit defined a new health measurement and accountability strategy, which articulates a shared agenda for the global health community, and resulted in the Roadmap for Health Measurement and Accountability. The Roadmap clearly outlines smart investments that can be adopted at the country level to strengthen basic measurement systems and align partners and donors around common priorities.

Explanation of Results

Ending preventable child and maternal deaths requires a health service delivery system that provides high-quality, equitable, and sustainable essential services to women, newborns, and children. &amp;nbsp;USAID’s equity-focused approach prioritizes services for the poorest and the most marginalized. &amp;nbsp;This approach is supported by work in health governance that equips local governments to effectively plan, manage, and finance high-quality maternal and child care services and commodities.

During FY 2014 and FY 2015, USAID’s programs across maternal, newborn, and child health; family planning; malaria; and nutrition aggressively targeted the drivers of death and disease.&amp;nbsp; Successes from this approach are evidenced by USAID’s progress in meeting or exceeding six out of six indicators in FY 2014 and five out of six indicators in FY 2015.

For the FY 2014-2015 indicators, the FY 2015 under-five mortality rate indicator was the only one that fell short of the annual target. &amp;nbsp;While the decline of 1.7 was below the target of 2, it was neither unexpected nor an indication of poor performance.&amp;nbsp; Rather, as USAID begins closing the gap between developing and developed country mortality rates, and making progress toward the Agency goal of ending preventable child deaths, USAID expects the absolute change to decrease from year to year.

PMI coordinates its procurement and distribution of ITNs with other major donors including the Global Fund, the World Bank, and UNICEF.&amp;nbsp; PMI exceeded the projected target due to a mass universal coverage campaign that was scheduled and successfully implemented in Uganda in FY 2014 and Nigeria in FY 2015.

Challenges and Opportunities

USAID will continue to report on the six FY 2014-2015 indicators for its FY 2016-2017 Global Health APG.&amp;nbsp; These indicators focus on high-impact child and maternal interventions with support for essential health system and human resource improvements.&amp;nbsp; Sustainable and equitable maternal, newborn, and child health programs depend on the overall quality of the health system. &amp;nbsp;USAID selected the priority countries because they have weak health systems, particularly for the delivery of primary health services.&amp;nbsp; In these high-burden countries, health systems are challenged by weak overall capacity, including lack of leadership and management skills; inadequate financing and budgetary allocations; and poor supply chains and infrastructure.&amp;nbsp; In addition, many of these countries have had services disrupted in recent years by disasters (e.g. earthquakes), conflict, and population displacement.

USAID continues to address bottlenecks and identify challenges that impact results, so that it can ensure family planning commodities continue to be available where needed.&amp;nbsp; In the delivery of family planning commodities, preclearance, custom clearance and manufacturing delays vary from country to country and can affect the timely shipment of procurements. &amp;nbsp;Overcoming these obstacles involves working closely with other USAID projects, missions, and partner country governments; the introduction of new in-country clearance agents better equipped to manage the clearance process; a change in the shipping lane assignment; and adjustment of the order lead times for procurement planning purposes.

One cannot underestimate the difficulty in achieving higher coverage of skilled birth attendants, given the significant challenges of sufficiently training and maintaining critical staff, as well as supporting health facilities and systems in adequately addressing the barriers to women seeking care. &amp;nbsp;To help support continued increases in skilled birth attendant coverage, USAID will continue to work in close collaboration with host country governments to help train, deploy, and motivate skilled birth attendants, in addition to strengthening existing systems for quality management and quality improvement and reducing barriers to use of services.

Finally, while DPT3 coverage across 24 USAID-assisted countries increased in FY 2015 to 80 percent, limited increments in future year targets are due to the challenge in the 24 USAID priority countries of reaching an entirely new birth cohort with all routinely recommended vaccines each year.&amp;nbsp; USAID continues to strive for high vaccination coverage, an effort that can be difficult to maintain in the presence of extreme weather events, disasters, conflict, failing health infrastructure, supply chain problems, and population displacement.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Deploying diplomats and development experts on the frontlines today is cheaper than deploying troops tomorrow.  This is why we are acting on several fronts to make investments that strengthen the impact of America’s foreign policy on our greatest strategic challenges.  We know the difference that the United States can make around the world, and we must continue to deliver diplomatic, security, development, and humanitarian solutions that match the scale of the challenges we face.
The challenges we face are great, many, and span the globe.  Whether it be providing care and treatment for HIV/AIDS and malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, strengthening judicial institutions in Latin America, building trust and combating extremism in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or joining with our European partners to deliver humanitarian assistance where disaster strikes, the United States is at work in every region of the world.  In all that we do, we are partnering with the United Nations and other international organizations, whose cooperation is critical to our success.
While the men and women of the Department of State and USAID are active worldwide, a few strategic challenges are singled out in this report because they exemplify our commitment to building performance capabilities and to measuring and reporting on our performance.  These challenges are:  building a new stability in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA); rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific; preventing and responding to crises and conflict, and providing humanitarian assistance to those in need; and combating challenges to global security and health.
Success in building a new stability in the MENA region is essential to U.S. global interests.  The region is in the midst of transition and crisis, and poses some of the most immediate challenges for U.S. national security.  The United States “rebalance” to the Asia-Pacific reflects a profound recognition that the security and prosperity of our nation will be shaped by developments in that region.  Home to two-thirds of the world’s people and many of its fastest growing economies, the Asia-Pacific presents both opportunities and challenges for U.S. strategic and economic interests.  A transatlantic renaissance in relations with European allies and partners is essential to successfully confronting global challenges, as well as shaping and defending international institutions and norms in line with our shared, democratic, free-market values.
In addition, more than 1.5 billion people worldwide live in fragile or conflict-affected states, or in countries trapped in cycles of violence.  When states cannot control their territory, protect their people, support sustainable growth, or help those in need, the resulting instability disrupts economic activity and fosters permissive environments for violent extremists and weapons proliferation. 
We must meet these and other global security and health challenges that affect international stability and prosperity, and threaten U.S. interests.  These challenges include securing the world’s most dangerous weapons; investing in rule of law; securing borders and combating transnational organized crime; and countering cyber threats.  And we must continue to work with bilateral and multilateral partners to strengthen health systems in developing countries, create an AIDS-free generation, end preventable child and maternal deaths, and reduce the threat of infectious diseases.

U.S. investments that result in healthier people make for stronger, more prosperous, and more stable countries; they enhance international security and trade; and they ensure a safer, more resilient America.  Despite successes in addressing health challenges in recent decades, in some places progress remains far too slow.  Much remains to be done to strengthen health systems in developing countries and address HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and maternal and child mortality.  In 2012, 6.6 million children under the age of five died, many from preventable causes.  Infectious, life-threatening diseases such as pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria are exacerbated by malnutrition and poor access to health services.  Infectious disease outbreaks, whether naturally caused, intentionally produced, or accidentally released, remain among the foremost dangers to human health and the global economy.  Many countries have limited capacity to prevent, detect, and rapidly respond to these threats.
Strategies for Achieving the Objective
The U.S. government has more than 10 years of experience in helping countries to rapidly expand HIV prevention, treatment, and care services through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). PEPFAR's current strategy, PEPFAR 3.0 - Controlling the Epidemic: Delivering on the Promise of an AIDS-Free Generation, showcases PEPFAR’s design to support the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)ambitious 90-90-90 global goals: 90 percent of all people living with HIV will know their HIV status; 90 percent of all people with diagnosed HIV infection will receive sustained antiretroviral therapy; and 90 percent of all people receiving antiretroviral therapy will have viral suppression by 2020.  This new focus requires a shift in business practices, pivoting to a data-driven approach that strategically targets geographical areas and populations where we can achieve the most impact for our investments.  The PEPFAR 3.0 strategy makes clear that the United States' commitment to this goal will remain strong, comprehensive, and driven by science. Importantly, this framework emphasizes impact, efficiency, sustainability, partnership, and human rights as core agendas to create an AIDS-free generation.
In 2012, the U.S. government joined more than 175 countries and 400 civil society and faith organizations in pledging to end preventable child deaths worldwide by 2035, as part of the Call to Action for Child Survival.  The Call to Action joins related efforts that have set ambitious goals to end preventable maternal and newborn deaths, increase access to voluntary family planning, and accelerate improvements in malaria, nutrition, and water and sanitation.  These renewed efforts have spurred strategic shifts in maternal and child health programming including:  increasing efforts in those countries with the largest share of under-five deaths, focusing on reaching the most underserved populations, targeting the drivers of mortality through innovation and scalable interventions, and creating mutual accountability at all levels.
The Ebola outbreak in West Africa is a jarring reminder of the need for a greater capability in all countries to rapidly detect and respond to new or re-emerging public health threats that “spill over” in humans from animal populations.  The Global Health Security agenda is an effort between the U.S. government, other nations, international organizations and public and private stakeholders, to accelerate progress toward a world safe and secure from infectious disease threats and to promote global health security as an international security priority.  The State Department, along with other U.S. government agencies, contributes to global health security by strengthening policies related to dual-use research of concern.
The U.S. government will use its influence in multilateral and bilateral arenas to focus attention on accelerating achievement of U.S. global health objectives and the UN Millennium Development Goals. Continued diplomatic leadership on global health in the UN Post-2015 Development Agenda will remain a U.S. priority.  Supported by the State Department and USAID, our diplomats and development professionals will promote country-owned health systems and encourage shared responsibility for financing health systems with partner governments, other donors, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector.  Although U.S. positions on health in the Post-2015 Development Agenda have yet to be finalized, they will likely include a focus on creating an AIDS-free generation and ending preventable child and maternal deaths.  The U.S. government is also considering incorporating new areas such as non-communicable diseases and a multi-sectoral focus on health system strengthening in the Post-2015 development goals.
Many external factors affect U.S. government efforts on country ownership and shared responsibility.  A successful transition to country ownership depends on political stewardship by partner governments and the administrative and technical capabilities of numerous public and private institutions.  Fiscal pressures on traditional donor countries will likely continue to negatively affect their ability to support multilateral initiatives. Steady economic growth in many regions, and particularly in Africa, will create opportunities for countries to direct more domestic resources toward their health sectors.
The U.S. government, through the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005 and newly-signed Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2014, is committed to using its foreign assistance resources to help people and countries have reliable and sustainable access to an acceptable quantity and quality of water to meet their needs.  USAID supports increased access to reliable and sustainable water supply and sanitation through funding for infrastructure development and through institutional and capacity development, strengthening of community-based systems, facilitation of private supply of products and services, improved management and governance, and mobilization of additional financing.
