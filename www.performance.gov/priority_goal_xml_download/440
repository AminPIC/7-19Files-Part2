Executive Order 13693 mandates a 2.5% annual reduction in facilities’ energy intensity as measured in British Thermal Units per gross square foot.&amp;nbsp; Improving DoD facility energy performance on installations will lower energy costs, improve mission effectiveness, improve energy security, and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

Energy is a fundamental enabler of military capability.&amp;nbsp; In the context of operational missions, understanding the implications of energy use in systems and weapons platforms enables DoD to improve combat effectiveness.&amp;nbsp; Specifically, the Department can assess the energy supportability of systems and concepts through scenario-based analyses that include realistic threats and logistics constraints.&amp;nbsp;

By September 30, 2025, DoD will improve its facility energy performance by reducing average building energy intensity by 25% from the 2015 baseline: 1) By September 30, 2017, DoD will improve its facility energy performance by reducing average facility energy intensity by 5% from a 2015 baseline.

By September 2018, DoD will institutionalize operational energy considerations in the force development process: 1) By September 30, 2016 DoD will ensure all acquisition programs that use operational energy and designated as Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) Interest Items by the Joint Staff have an Energy Supportability Analysis(ESA)-informed Energy Key Performance Parameter (eKPP); 2) By September 30, 2017, DoD will include operational energy constraints and limitations analyses in all Title 10 war games; and 3) By September 30, 2018, DoD will ensure ESAs are used in all acquisition programs that use operational energy and were established in FY16 and later.
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Improving facility energy performance at Department of Defense (DoD) installations will reduce reliance on fossil fuels, lower energy costs, improve mission effectiveness, and improve energy security. Efficiencies will be achieved by reducing the demand for&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; traditional energy while increasing the supply of renewable energy. Legislation mandates a 3 percent annual reduction in facilities energy intensity as measured in British Thermal Units per gross square foot (BTU/GSF). Additionally, the Department has a requirement to increase production or procurement of renewable energy equal to 25 percent of its electrical energy usage by fiscal year (FY) 2025.

Reliable and detailed data on energy consumption are essential to improving decision making within the Department. Recently, the Department has improved the measurement of operational energy consumption and is improving the use of this information in the requirements, acquisition, and resourcing processes throughout the Department.

The DoD is the single largest consumer of energy in the nation, accounting for&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; approximately one percent of national demand. For FY2014, the Department has budgeted approximately $20 billion on energy, with 80 percent going to support military operations (“operational energy”) and the remaining 20 percent to power its fixed installations (“facility energy”).

Operational Energy

Operational Energy is the use of energy to train, move, and sustain military forces and weapons platforms for military operations. Overseen by the Assistant Secretary of&amp;nbsp;Defense for Energy, Installations and Environment&amp;nbsp;(ASD (EI&amp;amp;E), “operational energy” powers generators at our contingency bases as well&amp;nbsp; as aircraft, ships, and tactical vehicles in operational and training activities around the globe.

Petroleum is currently the fuel of choice for military operations because of its high energy density, fungibility, and global availability. As a result, a steady and reliable supply of petroleum is essential to every military capability and mission. However, the Department’s ability to reliably deliver petroleum to deployed forces is challenged by a variety of geographic, geopolitical, and military challenges.

The Department’s first ever Operational Energy Strategy was released in 2011. This strategy outlines three principal ways to achieve energy security for the Department: reducing the demand for energy, expanding and securing the supply of energy, and building energy security into the future force.

Facility Energy

The second broad use of energy is to support the more than 500 fixed installations we operate in the United States and overseas. Overseen by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations and Environment, “facility energy” consists largely of traditional energy sources used to heat, cool, and provide electrical power to these buildings. It also includes the fuel used by the 200,000 non-tactical vehicles housed at our installations. The DoD has pursued a facility energy investment strategy designed to reduce the energy costs and improve the energy security of our bases.

Despite falling short of the FY 2014 intensity reduction goal of 27 percent, the DoD reduced its energy intensity by 17.6 percent from the FY 2003 baseline and improved by 0.4% from FY 2013. While DoD continues to invest in cost-effective energy efficiency and conservation measures to improve goal progress, there will be challenges in future reductions. These challenges will include: (1)&amp;nbsp; budget sequestration and delayed appropriations, which lead to a reduction in&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; energy efficiency and conservation projects, (2)&amp;nbsp; uncontrollable variables such as weather and temperature variability (i.e., heating and cooling degree days ), increasing facility energy use, and (3)&amp;nbsp; a greater reliance on&amp;nbsp; conducting missions at fixed installations and enduring locations (e.g., training, unmanned aircraft, intelligence, surveillance or&amp;nbsp; reconnaissance missions) , leading to an increased reliance on&amp;nbsp; energy from fixed installations and enduring locations. However, DoD saw significant gains in renewable energy performance in FY2014. DoD increased the amount of renewable energy it produced or procured from 11.8% in FY2013 to 12.3% in FY2014.

In FY2015 Q1-Q2, DoD held Program Reviews with each of the Military Services and analyzed their proposed energy budgets and energy programs&amp;nbsp;to ensure they were on track to meet energy goals. In FY2015 Q1, DoD received appropriations and began the process for executing energy conservation projects.&amp;nbsp;

DoD continues to execute energy conservation investments in the Military Services' Operations and Maintenance accounts; and facility energy conservation projects through the Energy Conservation Investment Program. FY2015 ECIP projects have been selected and funds&amp;nbsp;should be&amp;nbsp;distributed soon to the Services for project execution. Further, DoD remains committed to reducing energy use through third-party financed contract vehicles like Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPC) and Utility Energy Service Contracts (UESC). Since the beginning of the President's Performance Contract Challenge in December 2011, more than $1 billion in ESPCs and UESCs have been awarded, with an additional $2.0 billion in the pipeline. The Military Services are continuously working on developing three GW (one GW per Military Service) of renewable energy by 2025. DoD has made great progress in deploying renewable energy on its Military installations and currently has 644 megawatts of renewable energy generation. Approximately 240 new renewable energy projects came online during FY2014. Military Services are exploring development of approximately 2.4 gigawatts of renewable energy projects by FY2020.

The Office of the Secretary of Defense, Science and Technology is leveraging advanced technology through the installation energy testbed. The testbed is a cost-effective way for DoD&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; to demonstrate and validate emerging energy technologies in a real-world environment. Projects conduct rigorous operational testing and assessment of the life-cycle costs of new technology while addressing DoD-unique issues. Following demonstrations, the DoD can be a sophisticated first user of successful cutting-edge, transformational energy technologies.

The Office of the Secretary of Defense, Business Enterprise Integration is developing a state-of-the-art, mission-driven, enterprise-wide energy information management system that can provide the appropriate information on energy consumption. With&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; accurate management, control, collection and analysis of energy data, DoD can more effectively monitor, measure, manage and maintain energy systems at their optimal performance levels; collect renewable energy generation and performance data; and compare performance across facilities and across Military Departments. Once fully developed, the Department can provide quarterly updates on&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; energy intensity and renewable energy generation.

Contributing programs or&amp;nbsp;partners outside the agency:

DoD relies on third-party investors to increase facility energy performance. These partnerships allow DoD to continue energy efficiency and renewable energy programs without using taxpayer dollars.

The Services are using performance based contracts to improve the energy efficiency of existing buildings. In response to&amp;nbsp;Executive Order 13693&amp;nbsp;calling on the federal government to initiate $4 billion worth of these performance based contracts over the next two years, the Department's share of this goal is more than half of that commitment ($2.2 billion).

The Department also relies on third-party financing for large-scale renewable energy projects. The Services have been active in pursuing privately financed projects using existing authorities.
