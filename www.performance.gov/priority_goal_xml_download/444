&amp;nbsp;
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>
The National Defense Authorization Act of 2010 mandates that the Department of Defense (DoD) have audit ready financial statements by 2017. Audit ready means the Department has strengthened its internal controls and improved its financial practices, processes, and systems so there is reasonable confidence the information can withstand an audit by an independent auditor.

DoD’s four principle financial statements include:

Statement of Budgetary Resources - Provides information about how budgetary resources were made available as well as their status at the end of the period. It is the only financial statement exclusively derived from the Department’s budgetary general ledger.

Balance Sheet - Reflects the Department’s financial position as of the statement date. The assets are the amount of future economic benefits owned or managed by the Department. The liabilities are amounts owed by the Department. The net position is the difference between the assets and liabilities.

Statement of Net Cost - Separately reports the components of the net cost of the Department’s operations for the period. Net cost is equal to the gross cost incurred by the Department less any exchange revenue earned from its activities, further adjusted for net gains and losses.

Statement of Changes in Net Position - Presents the total cumulative results of operations since inception and unexpended appropriations at the end of the fiscal year. The statement focuses on how the net cost of operations is financed. The resulting financial position represents the difference between assets and liabilities as shown on the consolidated balance sheet. This statement is supported by achieving an audit ready Balance Sheet and Statement of Net Cost.


APG challenges include:


	Valuation of Assets: Valuation of General Property, Plant, and Equipment and of Inventory and Related Property is critical. Many of the Department’s assets were acquired decades ago and before there was a requirement to produce financial statements. As a result, the acquisition (cost) documents required for supporting valuation and audit are often no longer available. For these assets, the Department must use alternative valuation methods.
	Fund Balance with Treasury: Due to the size of the Department’s budget and the enormous amount of funds expended and collected, the number of accounting transactions that must be reconciled between the Department’s accounts and Treasury is very large and the task complex.
	Statement of Budgetary Resources:
	
		Universe of Transactions- Providing complete universes of transactions is especially challenging for the Components because of the numerous accounting systems used to initiate and record transactions as well as hundreds of feeder systems where most transactions originate.
		Beginning Balances-Components must verify that open obligations for all active and expired appropriations are supported before beginning Statement of Budgetary Resources (SBR) audits, and many hundreds of open and expired appropriations must be reviewed.

The Department of Defense will continue to assess and make appropriate adjustments as we work to achieve the “DOD Financial Audit Readiness” agency priority goal.&amp;nbsp;

To provide a more direct focus on progress indicators for specific critical path/risk areas aligned to ensuring the Departments’ financial statements are audit ready by 2017, DOD will revise the current performance indicators and add additional indicators to the 2016-2017 “DOD Financial Audit Readiness” agency priority goal.

DOD is committed to complete and accurate reporting of the financial improvement efforts; the following reports provide insight into the progress the Department in making to towards Financial Audit Readiness.
