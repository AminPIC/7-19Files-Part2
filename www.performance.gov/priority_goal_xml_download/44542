By September 30, 2017, the Department of the Interior will mainstream climate change adaptation and resilience into program and regional planning, capacity building, training, infrastructure, and external programs, as measured by scoring at least 400 of 500 points using the Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan scorecard.
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Problem or opportunity being addressed

Interior established policy emphasizing the importance of considering and analyzing potential climate change impacts in long-range planning exercises. These plans evaluate risks to and vulnerabilities in bureau operations and missions, and outline actions to manage these in the short- and long-term. Interior continues to develop, implement and update comprehensive plans to integrate consideration of climate change science and response strategies to make the nation’s communities, watersheds, and natural resources more resilient, and safeguard our cultural heritage.

&amp;nbsp;

Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives

The Secretary of the Interior identified the effects of climate change as a challenge affecting missions across Interior, just as the President identified in his Climate Change Action Plan Policy and Executive Order 13514 (October 5, 2009) and “Preparing the United States for the Impacts of Climate Change” (November 1, 2013). &amp;nbsp; (https://www.whitehouse.gov/climate-change) Interior has developed&amp;nbsp;Climate Change resilience policies and strategies&amp;nbsp;providing&amp;nbsp;principles and guidance to bureaus and offices for addressing climate change impacts on Interior’s mission, programs, operations and personnel. (See https://www.doi.gov/climate).

&amp;nbsp;

Key barriers and challenges 

Understanding, communicating, and responding to the diversity of impacts associated with climate change across the various landscapes of the United States is an ambitious undertaking.&amp;nbsp; Identifying similar terminology and means of measurement, engaging in collaborative communications with partners both within and outside Interior, obtaining adequate scientific understanding, and integrating various datasets and information sources are just some aspects of this effort that are already underway, and each of these activities is challenging.&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Stakeholder Engagement

Climate Science Centers and Landscape Conservation Cooperatives engage Interior and other Federal agencies, local and State partners, and the public to design practical, landscape-level strategies for managing climate-change impacts.&amp;nbsp; Interior is building the scientific and organizational infrastructure to work with partners to develop adaptation tools and coordinate climate-change responses at the landscape level.&amp;nbsp; Interior is partnering to develop state-of-the-art strategies to translate science into adaptive management and to develop robust ecological-forecasting models.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

Bureaus and offices will also review and modify planned schedules as necessary to complete as many activities as possible by the end of FY 2017

The Bureau of Energy and Ocean Management added additional activities that are now being tracked and reported.
</next_steps><progress_update>Collectively the Department has scored 263 points on its way to at least 400 points toward mainstreaming policies and procedures that promote climate change adaptation.

The Department created a scorecard based on the strategies to achieve the climate change goal of the Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan (SSPP) to demonstrate progress in implementing the President’s Action Plan for Climate Change.&amp;nbsp; The Department’s bureaus identified representative actions that highlight significant achievement in implementing change in program management to address climate change impacts.&amp;nbsp; The scorecard awards points for progressing through four stages of either developing and issuing a policy or process, or conducting an activity that involves multiple deliverables, individuals, projects, etc.&amp;nbsp; This Priority Goal is a continuation of a previous Climate Change Agency Priority Goal, but with the next phase of climate change adaptation initiatives being tracked.

Bureau actions to implement the climate change goal strategies progressed toward their intended achievements as planned in the third quarter. Almost all of the planned activities by all Departmental bureaus and offices met their expected milestones.&amp;nbsp;

In addition to a small set of bureau-specific climate change adaptation training activities within the goal, all bureaus conducted inventories and planning to document the climate change training needed to address the unique workforce in their bureau.&amp;nbsp;
</progress_update><themes><theme>Natural Resources and Environment</theme></themes><contributing_programs_and_other_factors>Contributing Programs within the agency

The Energy and Climate Change Task Force, co-chaired by the Deputy Secretary and Counselor to the Secretary, lead climate change activities across Interior. The Climate Change Working Group, co-chaired by the Special Counselor to the Secretary and the Director of the Office of Policy Analysis, is responsible for day-to-day activities and monitoring. Regional Climate Science Centers and Landscape Conservation Cooperatives provide feedback to the Working Group and the Task Force.

&amp;nbsp;

Contributing programs or partners outside the agency

The goal advances the recommendations and efforts of the Climate Change Preparedness and Resilience Council, co-chaired by the White House Council on Environmental Quality, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the Homeland Security Advisor to the President (https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ceq/initiatives/resilience). The Climate Change Preparedness and Resilience Council ensures that federal agency policies and programs better prepare the U.S. to respond to the impacts of climate change.&amp;nbsp; Interior integrated its climate change adaptation strategies within its Sustainability Plan in response to the policies developed through the Council on Environmental Quality. Interior also works closely with local, state and tribal governments and non-governmental partners through the Landscape Conservation Cooperatives, Climate Science Centers and other regional partnership initiatives.

</objective_statement><objective_overview>Protecting America’s landscapes and natural resources is among the Department’s high priority conservation goals.  The Department manages over 530 million acres of public lands, together with associated waterways and plant and animal species.  In addition, the Department provides grant funding to States and Tribes for mitigating the adverse environmental effects of past mining on private lands.  Land in desired condition is valued for providing ecosystem services, recreational and scenic merits, and vast open spaces, which contribute to public enjoyment and health.  Maintaining or improving the condition of stream and shoreline miles benefits fish populations, enhances wildlife habitat, and contributes to a balanced ecology.  The Nation’s forests, mountains, wetlands, grasslands, and deserts host biological diversity that is critical to overall ecosystem health, and species survival and well-being.  Protecting the thousands of native plant and animal species, including those with special status under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), preserves the rich natural legacy of this Nation both today and for future generations.
