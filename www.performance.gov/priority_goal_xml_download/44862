By September 30, 2017, reduce rates of repeat incarceration in five target tribal communities by 3% through a comprehensive “alternatives to incarceration” strategy that seeks to address underlying causes of repeat offenses, including substance abuse and social service needs, through tribal and federal partnerships.
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Problem or opportunity being addressed

The rate of recidivism nationally among Native Americans, an estimated 33% higher than non-native populations, creates a huge drain on the already overtaxed local Native economies: overcrowding at dilapidated detention centers, court dockets overwhelmed with cases, and, in many instances, loss of family primary bread winners.

This priority goal seeks to reduce recidivism by addressing root causes and by implementing alternatives to incarceration.&amp;nbsp; In terms of addressing underlying causes of re-arrest, BIA focuses resources on drug and alcohol abuse treatment and prevention programs, including addressing pre-disposing factors such as safety in the home and community; emotional, psychological, and physical poverty; and grief from loss of family and culture.&amp;nbsp; BIA coordinates social service needs of the target population, including mental health, education, employment, and family issues with the goal of reducing re-offenses.&amp;nbsp; In terms of alternatives to incarceration, BIA uses, as appropriate, probation, courts specific to substance abuse cases, and traditional cultural courts including healing to wellness courts that apply solutions-focused sentencing options and talking circles for truant juveniles.

This priority goal focuses on reducing repeat incarceration in five tribal communities.&amp;nbsp; Three communities, Duck Valley, Red Lake, and Ute Mountain, carry over from the FY 2014-15 priority goal.&amp;nbsp; For FY 2016-17, two additional communities will be identified and included. &amp;nbsp;Communities are chosen based on existing infrastructure and services, and the potential for enhancing these services/infrastructure, as well as tribal willingness to participate.&amp;nbsp; During the 2014-15 goal period, the first year involved putting into place the services, infrastructure, and activities at the pilot locations.&amp;nbsp; Actual measurement began in FY 2015, during which there were 81 repeat offenders among the 150 habitual offenders initially identified in FY 2013 at the three tribal communities; a reduction of 69 in the number of repeat offenders .&amp;nbsp; Given the length of time required to address the causes of repeat offenses, the FY 2016-17 results, combined with those of FY 2015, will give the Department a more realistic, multi-year picture of these recidivism reduction efforts. &amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives

The recidivism reduction effort ties directly to Mission Area 2, “Strengthening Tribal Nations and Insular Communities,” in the Department of the Interior’s FY 2014-2018 Strategic Plan as well as Administration initiatives to improve the quality of life in tribal and native communities.&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Key barriers and challenges 

While pursuing the prior FY 2010-2013 Priority Goal on reducing violent crime, BIA realized that reducing the number of repeat offenses could have a significant effect on the crime rate.&amp;nbsp; Techniques used in other cities that direct attention and services to reducing repeat offenses were considered for application in tribal communities.&amp;nbsp; Duck Valley, Red Lake and Ute Mountain, three very geographically dispersed communities, experience high levels of crime, disparate levels of staffing and training, equipment shortages, and significant differences and gaps in technology.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, reducing recidivism requires negotiating commitments with the Justice Department’s Tribal justice program and internal BIA programs.&amp;nbsp; Successful reduction in repeat incarcerations also requires cooperation and support from federal, state and tribal participants.&amp;nbsp;

Other key challenges may include:


	Access to tribal correctional facilities records;
	Availability of funding for components of the program not under Interior’s jurisdiction, e.g. detention facilities;
	Availability of substance abuse treatment programs – social program budgets, staffing, and capacity have not kept pace with the increased law enforcement effort;
	Sentencing resources and alternative program availability; and
	Other environmental, social, and economic factors.


&amp;nbsp;

Stakeholder Engagement

This priority goal and the implementation plan included consultation with tribal leaders of the participating reservations to ensure a high level of understanding and commitment for the goal.&amp;nbsp; Developing alternatives to incarceration requires ongoing coordination with, and assistance from, multiple entities within the tribal community to confront issues such as substance abuse, domestic violence, and worker training that can impact recidivism rates.&amp;nbsp; Interior regularly meets with and assists tribal programs to discuss progress and any barriers or issues that may negatively affect meeting the goal.

</next_steps><progress_update>This FY 2016-2017 priority goal, an expansion of the FY 2014-2015 goal, continues to track the 2013 baseline of 150 habitual offenders from the original three tribes, Red Lake Nation, Ute Mountain Ute and Shoshone-Paiute of Duck Valley. Additionally, a baseline of 60 habitual offenders in two new tribal communities, Ft. Belknap and Pascua Yaqui, was established using FY 2015 administrative arrest data.&amp;nbsp; Recidivism of these habitual offenders is being tracked and reported for FY 2016 and FY 2017. Performance is measured by the total number of repeat offenders.&amp;nbsp; Baseline data for each tribe was established by counting the number of bookings of the most frequent offenders and identifying how many of those offenders were “habitual,” defined as three or more bookings for adults and two or more for juveniles.&amp;nbsp; If one of these habitual offenders is booked during the FY 2016-2017 period, the individual is counted as a “repeat offender” in the quarter in which the individual was booked.&amp;nbsp; At the end of the fiscal year, the cumulative count of repeat offenders is used to generate the percentage change in recidivism relative to the baseline.&amp;nbsp;

Initial three tribal communities:&amp;nbsp; Through Q4 of FY 2016, 93 of the 150 habitual offenders were re-arrested.&amp;nbsp;

Two additional tribal communities: Through Q4 of FY 2016, 18 of the 60 habitual offenders were re-arrested. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;

With these initial reduced rates of rearrests among habitual offenders in these five communities, the Department is on track to meet the goal of a 3% decline in recidivism.&amp;nbsp; However, it will take time to determine how effective this approach for targeting individuals with specific social service and drug and alcohol addiction treatment programs is in reducing the number of repeat offenses.&amp;nbsp; The Department will need to examine the results over several years of measurement to better ensure sustained declines in recidivism by addressing the underlying root causes of re-arrest.
