By September 30, 2017, the Department of the Interior will provide 100,000 work and training opportunities over four fiscal years (FY 2014 through FY 2017) for individuals age 15 to 35 to support Interior’s mission.
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Problem or opportunity being addressed

The future of the Nation’s natural, cultural and historic heritage depends on the next generation of active stewards.&amp;nbsp; The Millennial generation, defined as individuals born in 1980 or later, is larger, more urban and diverse than any generation in our history.&amp;nbsp; Yet Millennials have grown up more disconnected from the natural world.&amp;nbsp; As Secretary Sally Jewell has said, “Engaging the Millennial generation in service on public lands, welcoming them into the Department of the Interior, and so many other opportunities to have work within public lands management, is going to be a critical part of our future, if we care about these special places that help define us.”

Secretary Sally Jewell, March 14, 2014 – Announcing the Next Generation Priority&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; http://www.doi.gov/youth/news/engaging-the-next-generation.cfm

Interior's Engaging the Next Generation priority goal seeks to establish meaningful and deep connections between young people from every background and every community to the great outdoors. &amp;nbsp;Interior is working to inspire millions of young people to play, learn, serve and work outdoors, and aims to provide 100,000 work and training opportunities over four years to individuals up to the age of 35. &amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives

This priority goal supports Mission Area 4, “Engaging the Next Generation,” of the Department of the Interior’s FY 2014-2018 Strategic Plan, as well as efforts to create a 21st Century Workforce.&amp;nbsp; Interior benefits from a workforce that is passionate about the mission, dedicated to public service, and highly skilled and knowledgeable.&amp;nbsp; Across Interior, 40% of our permanent workforce will be eligible to retire within the next five years.&amp;nbsp; As part of our succession planning, a variety of work and training opportunities to next generation students and recent graduates are provided.&amp;nbsp; Interior’s goal of engaging youth in conservation includes programs to encourage the nation’s youth to play, learn, serve, and work in the great outdoors.&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Key barriers and challenges 

By and through its partners, Interior must provide work and training opportunities within a specific time-frame for seasonal and temporary summer employment.&amp;nbsp; If bureaus miss the window of opportunity during the limited time-frame, participants may seek employment opportunities elsewhere.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, with approximately one-third of Interior youth employment stemming from partnership agreements, our ability to enter into partnership agreements is essential, particularly for the peak hiring seasons when colleges are out of session.&amp;nbsp; These public/private partnership efforts help to leverage Federal dollars, in some cases by a 3 to 1 ratio, and assist Interior in increasing youth employment opportunities.&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Stakeholder Engagement

Interior partners with the Corps Network, which engages 30,000 young people in all 50 States, in addition to the Public Lands Service Coalition.&amp;nbsp; Also, Interior partners with non-profit, corporate, state, local and tribal entities to enhance volunteer service opportunities and youth employment in the great outdoors. &amp;nbsp;Interior will continue to engage these stakeholders in implementing broader youth stewardship and engagement.&amp;nbsp;

The Department is also building capacity to improve millennial employment through Hiring Excellence Workshops which discuss hiring flexibilities regarding youth employment, and partnering with Peace Corps to recruit returning Peace Corps Volunteers.

</next_steps><progress_update>In the fourth quarter of FY 2016, an additional 8,199 new permanent, temporary and seasonal hires, and new partnership opportunities for individuals between 15-35 years of age were added to the FY2014-2016 total for a cumulative total of 76,344 next generation employment and training opportunities.&amp;nbsp; Approximately one-third of the Department's youth employment stems from partnership agreements.&amp;nbsp; Our ability to enter into partnership agreements is essential, particularly for the peak hiring seasons when colleges are out of session. These employment opportunities, which help to leverage Federal dollars, in some cases by a 3 to 1 ratio and assist Interior in increasing youth employment opportunities, are typically expected in the third and fourth quarters of FY 2016, during the warmer months that are more conducive to outdoor activities and school is out of session.

Contributing programs or partners outside the agency

The 21st Century Conservation Service Corps (21CSC) is a key component of President Obama’s America’s Great Outdoors Initiative which was launched in 2010 to encourage Americans, particularly young people, to enjoy our country’s rivers and waterways, farms and forests, and parks.&amp;nbsp; The 21CSC establishes quality jobs, career pathways and service opportunities for youth and veterans, and facilitates collaboration with multiple partnership organizations to employ youth.&amp;nbsp; These partnerships include Federal agencies, such as the Departments of Labor and Agriculture, Office of Personnel Management, and Corporation for National and Community Service and non-Federal Partners, such as The Corps Network, Southwest Conservation Corps, and Student Conservation Association. &amp;nbsp;

</objective_statement><objective_overview>Young people’s involvement in the Department’s stewardship activities provides benefits that are far reaching, including: educating a generation about nature and the values surrounding conservation; infusing energy and new thinking into the Federal Government; creating opportunities to improve the health of younger generations; providing hands-on green job experience and career pathways; and supplying important economic benefits in both rural and urban communities.  The Department’s bureaus and offices are taking a number of steps to engage the next generation in the Department’s conservation work, including partnering with schools, coordinating volunteers, and welcoming young people to play, learn, serve, and work in the outdoors.  With one-third of the Department’s workforce eligible to retire within the next 5 years, engaging the next generation is critical not only for the health of our public lands and economy, it also is key to ensuring a new generation of land managers, wildlife biologists, tribal experts, park rangers, scientists, civil engineers, lawyers, and the many other professionals that enable the Department to carry out its diverse missions.
