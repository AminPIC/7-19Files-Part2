By September 30, 2017, the Department of the Interior (through the Fish &amp;amp; Wildlife Service) will double the acres of restored or enhanced habitat for Monarch butterflies and other pollinators. (Doubling the number of acres restored or enhanced for Monarch butterflies and other pollinators by September 30, 2017 will result in a total of 320,000 acres of agency land, private land, and state land restored or enhanced.)
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Problem or opportunity being addressed

This Agency Priority Goal (APG) is part of Interior’s efforts to support and implement the National Strategy to Promote the Health of Honey Bees and Other Pollinators (Strategy) released on May 19, 2015, by the White House Pollinator Health Task Force (Task Force).&amp;nbsp; The Strategy documents current and planned Federal actions to achieve three longer-term overarching goals:


	Honey Bees: Reduce honey bee colony losses during winter within 10 years.
	Monarch Butterflies: Increase the Eastern population of the monarch butterfly by 2020.
	Pollinator Habitat Acreage: Restore or enhance land for pollinators over the next 5 years through Federal actions and public/private partnerships.


The Strategy addresses four themes:


	conducting research to understand, prevent, and recover from pollinator losses;
	expanding public education programs and outreach;
	increasing and improving pollinator habitat; and
	developing public-private partnerships across all these activities.


The Strategy consists of a Pollinator Research Action Plan (Plan), and plans for outreach and education; habitat enhancement and increased acreage; and public-private partnerships.&amp;nbsp; The Task Force will modify and adjust the Strategy to reflect evolving science. This will ensure that Federal agencies use resources effectively to improve pollinator habitat and health. The President directed representatives from each of the departments and agencies responsible for various elements of the plan to report regularly to the Task Force.

Interior’s proposed FY2016/2017 priority goal is one portion of the Government-wide response to the Strategy and complements other agencies’ efforts (as both part of proposed APGs, as well as other Task Force implementation actions) without being duplicative.&amp;nbsp;


	The monarch butterfly population is in crisis, having declined by more than 90 percent from its peak in the late 1990’s to the lowest population count on record during the winter of 2013-2014.&amp;nbsp; The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) leads the federal government’s efforts to guide actions for monarch conservation, which serves as a flagship effort for broader pollinator conservation work. Interior’s APG on Monarchs and Other Pollinators directly addresses two of the three Task Force overarching goals (on Monarch Butterflies and Pollinator Habitat) as well as addressing public education and outreach and public-private partnerships.&amp;nbsp;



	The other agencies with APGs related to pollinators also address multiple but not identical facets of the National Strategy to Promote the Health of Honey Bees and Other Pollinators.

	
		The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) APG focuses on habitat restoration to assist honey bees and other pollinators (not specifically Monarchs).&amp;nbsp; This effort directly addresses the goal for honey bees while also addressing pollinator habitat in general.&amp;nbsp;
		The Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) APG addresses assessment of pesticides, other commercially available chemicals, and the risks those may pose to honey bees and other pollinators.&amp;nbsp; This goal also addresses larger issues affecting all pollinators and is complementary to all other agency efforts since it uses EPA’s expertise in risk evaluation of the use of chemicals in the environment.

Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives

This priority goal supports Goal 1, “Protect America’s Landscapes,” in Mission Area 1 of the Department of the Interior’s FY 2014-2018 Strategic Plan. The strategies employed in this goal are: 1) Improve land and water health by managing the wetlands, uplands, and riparian areas that comprise our national parks, wildlife refuges, and BLM lands; and 2) Sustain fish, wildlife, and plant species by protecting and recovering the Nation’s fish and wildlife in cooperation with partners, including states.&amp;nbsp; The state of Monarchs reflects the health of the American landscape and its pollinators. Monarch population declines are symptomatic of environmental problems that also pose risks to food production; the spectacular natural places that help define our national identity, and our own health. Conserving and connecting habitat for monarchs will benefit many other plants and animals, including critical insect pollinators, as well as future generations of Americans.

&amp;nbsp;

Key barriers and challenges 

North American monarch butterflies are in trouble. Threats, including loss of milkweed habitat needed to lay their eggs and for their caterpillars to eat, are having a devastating impact on monarch populations and the migration phenomenon.&amp;nbsp; Much of the habitat that Monarchs and other pollinators utilize is on private lands, so it is crucial to have a strong set of partners who can reach out and work with private landowners to create sufficient habitat to protect and sustain healthy populations of Monarchs and other pollinators.

&amp;nbsp;

Stakeholder Engagement

The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the National Wildlife Federation (NWF) and the Fish and Wildlife Service serves as a catalyst for national collaboration on monarch conservation, particularly in planting native milkweed and nectar plants - the primary food sources in breeding and migration habitats for the butterfly.&amp;nbsp; One of the MOU goals is to stimulate efforts to work together — individuals, communities, farmers, land managers, and local, state, and federal agencies — to ensure that every American child has a chance to experience amazing Monarchs in their backyards. Stakeholder engagement plans address the growing threats affecting so much of America’s treasured wildlife — habitat loss, pesticide overuse and climate change — to preserve Monarchs and America’s rich wildlife legacy. The NWF and its state affiliates will engage other key partners on the front lines of action. The USDA agencies implementing the conservation provisions of the 2014 Farm Bill will play a key role in helping engage agricultural producers in monarch conservation efforts.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

The National Fish and Wildlife Federation’s (NFWF) new Monarch Conservation Fund provides the first dedicated source of funding for projects working to conserve monarchs. From California to the Corn Belt, the FWS will fund numerous conservation projects totaling $2 million in 2015 to restore and enhance more than 200,000 acres of habitat for Monarchs while also supporting over 750 schoolyard habitats and pollinator gardens. Many of the projects will focus on the monarch flyway anchored around the I-35 corridor from Texas to Minnesota - areas that provide important spring and summer breeding habitats for the eastern population.

The FWS has developed a draft Monarch Butterfly Conservation Work Plan that defines the strategies and actions needed to meet strategic habitat conservation goals.&amp;nbsp; The Work Plan will be finalized as a dynamic document that will guide activities for the remainder of the goal period and beyond, increase accountability and enhance performance.
</next_steps><progress_update>Actions have been taken to restore or enhance habitat for monarchs and other pollinators on a total of 332,038 acres (104 percent of the 2-year goal) as of the end of the fourth quarter of FY 2016 that are expected to provide habitat in the near future. &amp;nbsp;The Fish &amp;amp; Wildlife Service (FWS) reported 292,490 acres of habitat restored or enhanced for monarchs and other pollinators in the fourth quarter of FY 2016.&amp;nbsp; The large increase in acres reported for the fourth quarter, compared to the acres reported in the first three quarters of FY 2016, reflects the timing of when most restoration and enhancement projects are being implemented in the field (most habitat restoration work for pollinators includes planting of appropriate feeding and breeding plants, which occurs in late spring through early fall) and the practice of reporting annual accomplishments through FWS databases during the fourth quarter.&amp;nbsp;

The number of acres treated by FWS has exceeded the two-year priority goal of restoring or enhancing 320,000 acres of habitat by the end of FY 2017, however, not all of those acres are available for use by pollinators yet. FWS will evaluate the restored and enhanced acres during FY 2017 to ensure that the objectives are met to provide habitat for Monarch butterflies and other pollinators. The FY 2016 accomplishment is the result of several factors, including: 1) bureau leadership identification of&amp;nbsp; monarch conservation as a FWS National Priority both internally to all employees and with external conservation partners, who actively engaged with FWS in delivery of conservation projects for monarchs and other pollinators; 2) the FWS commitment of $4 million in funding for monarch conservation in FY 2016, and 3) opportunities to enhance a large number of acres on national wildlife refuges in the Great Plains by increasing the amount of forbs present through application of prescribed burning and prescribed grazing treatments.

The Division Chief of Natural Resources and Conservation Planning, National Wildlife Refuge System, will collect information (semiannually) on the habitat restoration and enhancement accomplishments and provide quarterly updates on implementation of priority goal activities.&amp;nbsp; Many of the FWS conservation programs will be engaged.&amp;nbsp; While the FWS will not be reporting on their efforts, other Interior bureau partners, such as the U.S. Geological Survey, the National Park Service, and the Bureau of Land Management are contributing to the monarch conservation initiative.

&amp;nbsp;

Contributing programs or partners outside the agency

The FWS collaborated with&amp;nbsp;NWF and&amp;nbsp;the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) to lead the charge in protecting monarch butterflies across the American landscape.&amp;nbsp; The NFWF created the Monarch Conservation Fund with an initial $1.2 million commitment from the FWS, matched by funding provided by the Monsanto Company, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Forest Service and Natural Resources Conservation Service, Bureau of Land Management, and private NFWF funds. Approximately $3.8 million is available in this inaugural year of the Monarch Butterfly Conservation Fund. Grants may be up to two years in length and will range in size from $50,000 to $250,000. Matching funds of at least 1:1 will be required. NFWF will strengthen efforts to reverse declines in the monarch population using other conservation grant programs it administers to including the Five-Star/Urban Waters Initiative and Pulling Together Initiative.

In a larger context, the Monarch Joint Venture is a partnership of federal and state agencies, non-governmental agencies, and academic programs working together to protect Monarchs and their migration. The partners are experts in the fields of monarch conservation and education working on monarch conservation in the U.S.&amp;nbsp; Partners in this effort include (but are not limited to) the USDA’s Forest Service, Natural Resources Conservation Service and Farm Service Agency, Iowa Department of Natural Resources, the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center, the Pollinator Partnership, the Tallgrass Prairie Center, and many others.&amp;nbsp; The partners will also work with Canada and Mexico to determine ways to collaborate internationally to save this species.
