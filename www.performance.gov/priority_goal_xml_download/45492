</next_steps><progress_update>Strategy #1: By Q2 FY 2016 establish a multiyear exascale research program plan in support of DOE’s contribution to the President’s high performance computing initiative.&amp;nbsp;

STATUS: &amp;nbsp;This measure has been completed. &amp;nbsp;The multiyear exascale research program plan in support of DOE’s contribution to the President’s National Strategic Computing Initiative (NSCI) has been incorporated into the NSCI Implementation Plan.&amp;nbsp; The NSCI Implementation Plan was submitted to the co-chairs of the NSCI Executive Council on October 26, 2015.

&amp;nbsp;

Strategy #2: By Q4 FY 2017 establish a plan for DOE’s contribution to research new progressive technologies that perform beyond Moore’s Law.

STATUS: &amp;nbsp;Q4 FY16 Milestone: Initiate Interagency discussion and consideration of the draft plan for a research program into technologies “beyond Moore’s Law”.

Result:&amp;nbsp;Milestone met. SC briefed the National Strategic Computing Initiative Working Group, the Quantum Information Systems Working Group, and OMB in September 2016.

&amp;nbsp;

Strategy #3: By Q4 FY 2017 identify software technology investments needed to accelerate delivery of a capable exascale system.

STATUS: Q4 FY16 Milestone: Finalize gathering of application requirements&amp;nbsp; Result: Milestone met. SC completed a series of application requirements workshops that spanned our mission space before the end of September 2016.
