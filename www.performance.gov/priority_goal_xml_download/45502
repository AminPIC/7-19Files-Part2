	Complete 90% of DOE post-Critical Decision (CD)-3, Approve Start of Construction or Execution, capital asset projects within 110% of the cost baseline in effect as of the start of FY 2016

</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>The Department of Energy (DOE) is the largest civilian contracting agency in the Federal Government and spends approximately 95% of its annual budget on contracts to operate its scientific laboratories, engineering and production facilities, and environmental restoration sites and acquire capital assets. The Department has been challenged, both externally and internally, to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its contract and project management processes.&amp;nbsp; The Department remains committed to making continuous improvements in contract and project management performance.

Since 1990, the Department has been on the GAO High-Risk List for inadequate contract and project oversight and management. In its February 2013 High-Risk List update, GAO acknowledged the Department’s continuing improvement in contract and project management by shifting the focus of DOE’s high-risk designation to major contracts and projects executed by NNSA and EM with values of $750 million or greater. This focus continued in GAO’s update provided in February 2015.

In November 2014, a working group of DOE’s most senior project managers produced an in-depth analysis of project management in a report entitled “Improving Project Management” which resulted in a Secretarial policy memorandum, “Improving the Department’s Management of Projects” released by the Secretary in December 2014. Based on the report and policy memorandum, and drawing from industry and government best practices, the Department took several steps to supplement ongoing efforts to improve project management, including: strengthening the Energy Systems Acquisition Advisory Board (ESAAB), establishing a Project Management Risk Committee (PMRC), and improving the lines of responsibility and the peer review process.

Progress toward achieving this goal, project management success, is tracked in the Department’s Project Assessment and Reporting System (PARS II) and reported to Program Offices, GAO and OMB on a quarterly basis.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Attaining mission success requires a sustained commitment to performance-based management and expectations of excellence from DOE headquarters to every site office, service center, laboratory, and production facility. At the center of this goal is a highly qualified, capable, and flexible federal workforce that can execute the mission in a safe, secure, efficient, and sustainable manner. DOE cultivates a performance-based system that links work to meeting agency and Administration goals and achieves results. Management of research and development involves prioritization of those activities with the greatest potential and likelihood for impact. Research decisions are informed by rigorous peer reviews at the portfolio level and solicitation levels. Also, improving contract and project management across the DOE enterprise is a top priority, along with vigilant protection of our cyber networks. Additional project cost and schedule analysis training will be provided, and upgrades will be sought for the information technology infrastructure.
