In Q1 FY17 (October – December 2016), measurement of the impact of DATACOMM implementation on Taxi Out Times will begin at two airports, where DATACOMM Segment 1 Phase 1 (S1P1) will already be fully operational: Newark (EWR) and John F Kennedy (JFK).&amp;nbsp; Impact measurement will continue at these two airports through Q3 FY2017.&amp;nbsp;
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>The DATACOMM program provides digital communications services between pilots and air traffic controllers (similar to text messaging).&amp;nbsp; DATACOMM will provide a link between ground automation and flight deck avionics for safety-of-flight ATC clearances, instructions, traffic flow management, flight crew requests and reports. DATACOMM is critical to the success of NextGen operational improvements (OIs) by providing needed communication infrastructure enhancements. DATACOMM will reduce the impact of delays due to ground delay programs, airport reconfigurations, convective weather, congestion, and other causes.&amp;nbsp; DATACOMM will also reduce communication errors, improve controller and pilot efficiency through automated information exchange, enable NextGen services (e.g., enhanced re-routes, trajectory operations), and increase controller productivity leading to increased capacity.

In Q4 FY2016 the FAA continued the implementation of the Segment 1 Phase 1 (S1P1) Tower service. &amp;nbsp;DATACOMM successfully completed enterprise testing of the Segment 1 Phase 1 (S1P1) services to support the next 15 towers in the implementation waterfall &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;DATACOMM also tested and accepted the initial air-ground network Data Communications Network Services (DCNS) for the next 15 towers. &amp;nbsp;The FAA conducted the necessary training of air traffic controller and technical operations personnel to support the deployment of S1P1 service to additional towers. &amp;nbsp;Finally, DATACOMM is coordinating with air carriers to ensure appropriately equipped aircraft and trained aircrews are available to support the deployment. A total of 46 towers are operational with DATACOMM S1P1 Tower service as of the end of Q4 FY2016.

			The Data Comm program is addressed at the following website:&amp;nbsp; http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/programs/datacomm/

			DATACOMM was identified as a top four priority program in the NextGen Priorities Joint Implementation Plan delivered to Congress in October 2014 (http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/snapshots/priorities/)

			Supporting programs include:

			- En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) (http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/technology/eram/)

			- Tower Data Link Services (TDLS)

			- FAA Telecommunications Infrastructure (FTI) (http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/technology/fti/)
