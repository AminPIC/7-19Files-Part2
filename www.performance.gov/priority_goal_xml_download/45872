By September 30, 2017, USDA will continue to implement and monitor progress of modeled science-based practices that improve soil health and sustainability. Nationwide, the soil health practices that are consistent with the Secretary’s Climate Change Mitigation Building Blocks will store (sequester) more than 8.8 million metric tons of carbon per year or more than 32 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e). &amp;nbsp;

Based on results generated by EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator (http://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator), the carbon sequestration benefits of an additional 32 million metric tons of CO2e annually would offset an estimated: 76 billion miles driven by passenger cars, or 3.6 billion gallons of gasoline consumed, or 4.4 million homes electricity use emissions for one year. Soil health practice implementation will also increase resilience during seasons with extreme weather, in comparison to fields that are not using such practices.

&amp;nbsp;
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>The world population is expected to rise from approximately 7 billion in 2013 to over 9 billion by 2050.&amp;nbsp; To sustain this rate of growth, we must provide as much food in the next 40 years as has been grown in the last 500 years.&amp;nbsp; From 1982 to 2007, over 41 million acres of rural land was lost to development (the size of Illinois and New Jersey combined).&amp;nbsp; Approximately 23 million acres of this was active agricultural land, and 14 million acres was prime farmland.

At the same time that we need to grow more food on a shrinking available land base, we are also asking more and more of our farmers and ranchers.&amp;nbsp; We ask that they help reduce our Nation’s dependency on fossil fuels by growing more bioenergy crops, that they provide adequate pollinator habitat (required for about 35% of our food supply), that they protect water quality, and that they incorporate management practices and technologies that optimize efficiencies of water and nutrient use.&amp;nbsp; In addition, while addressing these needs, producers are increasingly faced with extreme weather events, ranging from drought to flood.

Improving soil health allows us to simultaneously address these and other pressing natural resource needs. &amp;nbsp;Improving soil health allows us to improve water quality, increase soil water availability, enhance resilience to extreme weather, enhance nutrient cycling, increase carbon sequestration, provide wildlife habitat (including pollinators), enhance rural economic opportunity, and meet the food and fiber production needs of a rapidly growing population on a shrinking available land base.&amp;nbsp; Simply stated, improving the health of our Nation’s soils is one of the most important things we can do for this and for future generations.

USDA assists agricultural producers with improving soil health through increased knowledge, education, and technical and financial assistance in implementing soil health management systems. &amp;nbsp;The research and educational activities conducted by USDA and its partners contribute much more than a body of knowledge. The information is integrated into policies that lead to the development of science-based standards and specifications for management practices, used for appropriate implementation of practices. The practices can then be combined in a systems approach, to form customized location-specific plans for conserving selected resources.&amp;nbsp; Such conservation plans are applied by land managers to improve soil health.&amp;nbsp; In addition, the impact of implementing these standardized practices can be measured and modeled nationally, especially when combined with land, soil, climate, and other data.

During the 4th quarter, USDA’s Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) conducted soil health outreach including over 90 direct assistance activities and more than 140 training and outreach events.&amp;nbsp; More than 14,000 people participated from many stakeholder groups, NRCS staffs, and conservation partners along with farmers and ranchers.&amp;nbsp; The agency continues to participate in &amp;nbsp;over 30 different committees or groups including:


	No-Till on the Plains
	State Soil Health Advisory groups
	Midwest Cover Crop Council
	Newly emerging Northeast and Southeast Cover Crop Councils
	Soil Health Institute committees
	Climate Hubs, among others.


A number of soil health publication efforts are in progress:


	Cover crop fact sheets
	Grazing fact sheet
	Paper reviews
	White papers (soil health assessments and grazing land soil health)
	State soil health video shoots


As a follow up from the 3rd quarter Soil Renaissance meeting in Ardmore, OK, NRCS led subcommittees representing multiple organizations to recommend standards for soil health indicators/methods to become part of an assessment of the nation's soil health status and to identify and recommend on-farm tools for soil health assessment and management.

NRCS is working with the new Soil Health Institute (emerged from the Soil Renaissance group) and will host a follow-up meeting in Louisville, KY to continue the decision making process.&amp;nbsp; As part of the Soil Renaissance meeting, participants from NRCS, ARS, LGUs and private labs will participate. Subcommittees will present the work they have done over the past quarter.

NRCS partners, especially those with Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG) funding, continued to conduct a large number of soil health projects. A partial accounting of the impact of 82 existing soil health demonstration sites in the Mid-west tells us one project alone hosted 40 events reaching 2,000 participants, in addition to 20 events for agricultural retailers and certified crop advisors with over 200 million viewers from media coverage.

As part of its overall soil health effort, NRCS’s “Unlock the Secrets in the Soil” awareness and education campaign continues to provide foundational educational materials and messaging to farmers and consumers alike. NRCS’s soil health-related videos have generated more than 800,000 YouTube views.&amp;nbsp; The latest “Soil Health Lesson in a Minute” video posted to the USDA Facebook page generated more than a quarter million views in just three days. Since their release earlier this year, NRCS’s soil health television public service announcements have aired approximately 23,000 times in 35 states.

Several USDA agencies will work cooperatively to achieve the APG.&amp;nbsp; Scientists from the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) in collaboration with our new NRCS Soil Health Division and other NRCS partners (for example universities and foundations and broader stakeholder groups) will conduct and summarize research on the impacts of soil health promoting practices on soil functional processes such as available soil water holding capacity, soil carbon, water infiltration, nutrient availability and other important production system attributes.&amp;nbsp; Programs administered by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) will be used to provide competitive grants aimed at filling in the knowledge gaps (e.g. for specific soil properties or soil health management systems).&amp;nbsp; Programs administered by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) will be used to demonstrate soil health assessments, soil health management systems, and their benefits (e.g. through Conservation Innovation Grants and Plant Materials Centers) and provide financial and technical assistance to enhance adoption of soil health promoting practices (e.g. through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, EQIP).&amp;nbsp; This cooperation will allow each Agency to contribute its own strengths to enhancing soil health across the public value chain from research to technology transfer to landowner adoption. &amp;nbsp;Existing partnerships with non-government organizations, Universities, foundations, and other partners will be leveraged and broadened to amplify the impact of these investments.&amp;nbsp; These combined efforts to enhance the health of our Nation’s soils will allow USDA to help farmers and ranchers feed the world, while regenerating and sustaining other ecosystem services, more profitably and sustainably – now and for generations to come.
