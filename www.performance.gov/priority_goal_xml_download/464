By September, 30, 2015, the Department of Justice will:


	Increase the number of records&amp;nbsp; submitted to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) Index by states and federal agencies by 10%;
	Increase the number of records entered into the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network (NIBIN) by 3%; and
	Increase the number of NIBIN “hits”, that is, the linkage of two or more separate crime scene investigations, based upon comparisons of the markings made on fired ammunition recovered from crime scenes by 3%.

</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>The Violent Crime Priority Goal supports the Administration’s plan to protect our communities by reducing gun violence with smart prevention and investigative strategies in order to prevent violent acts from occurring.&amp;nbsp; Gun-related violence continues to constitute a serious threat to public safety throughout the United States.&amp;nbsp; While data shows that overall violent crime in the United States has decreased in the past thirty years, many communities continue to experience high levels of gun violence.&amp;nbsp; The Department recognizes that the challenges confronting each community are different and require solutions tailored to each community’s needs.&amp;nbsp; The Department will focus its actions and resources on 1) gun-violence prevention, by effecting an increase in the number of records submitted to NICS Index, which in turn supports the Department’s efforts to accurately and expeditiously identify persons who are legally prohibited from possessing firearms and (2) enhanced and more effective investigation by substantially increasing the number of records entered into NIBIN that contribute to investigative leads.&amp;nbsp; Collectively, accomplishment of these goals will demonstrate and facilitate our progress in preventing and investigating gun-related violent crime.

The Department exceeded its 2-year target (a 10% increase for the “Number of records submitted to the NICS Index” over the FY 2013 baseline of 1,051,834 records), achieving an increase of 27.1%. The Department exceeded FY 2014 targets (1,104,426 records) for this measure by 43.1%.

For the second measure (a 3% increase for the “Number of entries in NIBIN” over the FY 2013 baseline of 171,115 records) achieving an increase of 21.3%. The Department exceeded its FY 2014 target (172,826 records) for this measure by 19.5%.

For the third performance measure (a 3% increase for “Number of “hits” in NIBIN over the FY 2013 baseline of 5,713 “hits”) the Department achieved an increase of 37.2%. The Department exceeded its FY 2014 target (5,769 “hits”) for this measure by 99.5%.

As a result of these efforts, a two year total of 187,879 identifed persons were legally prohibited from possessing firearms due to the expeditious and accurate NICS background check and denial process. In addition during this two year period, 6,190 federal, state, and local users were trained in NIBIN and 4,527 investigators and analysts were trained to identify how NIBIN can assist them in the investigation process.

FY 2015 4th Quarter Progress Update

In FY 2015 4th quarter, the Department exceeded its quarterly performance targets for two of the three performance measures for the Violent Crime Priority Goal and achieved 95% of its target for the third measure.

For the first performance measure “Number of records submitted to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) Index”, the Department submitted 276,157 records in FY 2015 4th quarter, achieving 95% of its quarterly target (289,254 records). This slight decrease in submitted records is largely attributed to records submitted by some federal agencies containing an expiration date, which requires their removal from the system and a slowdown in state participation and submission rates. However, over the last two fiscal years, the total NICS submissions has exceeded the projected goal. The submission of records by state agencies will fluctuate from one reporting period to another depending on whether new states begin submitting records into the NICS Index files, enter a backlog of records into the system, or simply supply the typical quarterly submissions. It is expected that state submissions will rise in the future as more states process their backlogs in this area.

For the second performance measure, “Number of entries in the National Integrated Ballistic Information (NIBIN) System, the Department submitted 55,654 entries in FY 2015 4th quarter, exceeding its quarterly target (44,062 entries) by 26% or 11,592 entries. ATF works regularly with their field divisions and local law enforcement agencies to stress the importance of entering ballistic evidence into the system and provide support in enforcement efforts where NIBIN is a key component in removing violent criminals off the streets.

For the third performance measure “Number of hits in NIBIN”, the Department submitted 2,175 hits in FY 2015 4th quarter exceeding its quarterly target (1,471 NIBIN hits) by 48% or 704 hits. Hits are defined as the linkage of two or more separate crime scene investigations, thus helping to identify more suspects and shooters and solve more violent crimes. The number of hits is a correlation with the number of NIBIN entries – as additional NIBIN entries are made, additional hits are normally generated for the similar reasons as the number of NIBIN submissions increase or decrease.

For the indicator, “Number of identified persons legally prohibited from possessing firearms due to the expeditious and accurate NICS background check and denial process”, 22,866 people were legally prohibited from possessing firearms in the FY 2015 4th quarter for an FY 2015 total of 100,719 individuals, exceeding the FY 2013 total of 92,111 and the FY 2014 total of 87,160.

For the indicators, “Number of Federal, State and local users trained in NIBIN” and “Number of investigators and analysts trained to identify how NIBIN can assist in the investigation process:, 764 persons were trained in NIBIN throughout the United States, while 631 persons were given presentations that focused on how NIBIN technology can assist in the investigation process.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>The Department embraces its historic role in keeping America safe by fighting crime, protecting civil rights, preserving the environment, ensuring fairness in the market place, and defending and representing the interests of the United States.  Accordingly, Goal 2 encompasses what is viewed as the traditional missions of DOJ: enforcing and upholding federal law.
 
From the violent gangs in our cities and suburbs, to sophisticated financial fraud schemes that threaten the financial security of all citizens, to the flow of drugs across the Southwest Border and the associated violent crime, the Department’s law enforcement mission is as complex and varied as it has ever been in its history.  Goal 2 covers this broad range of law enforcement issues, including violent crime, illegal drugs, criminal gangs, and gun violence.  It includes white collar crimes, such as health care fraud, corporate fraud, and public corruption.  It also includes computer crime, identity theft, IP crime, and other kinds of crime facilitated by computer networks.  In addition, it covers the exploitation of vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly.  This goal also includes enforcing federal civil and criminal statutes that protect civil rights, safeguard the environment, preserve a competitive market structure, and preserve the integrity of the Nation’s bankruptcy system.
 
Goal 2 addresses the role of the Department as the Nation’s largest law office and chief litigator, which involves representing hundreds of United States’ agencies, offices, and employees and defending against myriad challenges to federal laws, programs, and policies.  This work is critical to protecting the federal fisc against unwarranted monetary claims and to ensuring the United States can continue to protect the Nation’s security, maintain civil law and order, and enhance public safety.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>All levels of law enforcement – international, federal, state, local, and tribal – as well as the Intelligence Community and partners in industry and academia look to DOJ for leadership and assistance.  The Department will continue to maintain and enhance existing partnerships, develop new relationships, and work with organizations at all levels to achieve common operational objectives.  Through strong relationships, all participants will enhance and benefit from the collective knowledge and understanding of the values inherent in the American justice system.
 
Goal 3 summarizes the work the Department will perform to promote relationships with law enforcement partners, protect individuals involved in federal judicial proceedings, provide housing and beneficial services for persons in federal custody, adjudicate and litigate immigration cases, and establish rule of law in the international community.  In each of these areas, the Department will continue to support its partners through direct operations or grant programs or both.
</strategic_goal_overview><strategic_goal_sequence>3</strategic_goal_sequence></Strategic_Goal></Strategic_Goals><Strategic_Objectives><Strategic_Objective><id>1325</id><objective_header>Combat the threat, incidence, and prevalence of violent crime</objective_header><objective_statement>Combat the threat, incidence, and prevalence of violent crime by leveraging strategic partnerships to investigate, arrest, and prosecute violent offenders and illegal firearms traffickers
</objective_statement><objective_overview>Violent crime remains a serious problem in many rural and urban areas and throughout much of Indian Country.  It continues to inflict a heavy toll on communities across America, limiting the quality of life for U.S. citizens, paralyzing neighborhoods, and stretching state and local law enforcement resources to their limits.
 
The vast majority of violent crime in this country falls within the jurisdiction of state and local agencies, and the vast majority of resources to combat it are provided by state and local governments.  While some cities are well-equipped to handle issues involving violent gangs, many smaller cities and towns are easily overwhelmed by the violence and criminal activity that gangs bring to their communities.  Each community faces different challenges that will require different solutions.
 
The Department will combat violent crime through vigorous investigation and prosecution of those who engage in violent criminal acts.  It will work with its law enforcement partners at the federal, state, local, tribal, and international level to combat all types of violence, from the neighborhood-based street gangs, to increasingly brutal and prevalent violence along the Southwest Border, to the transnational gangs operating throughout the United States and abroad, to violent criminals seeking haven in the United States.  It will also employ a comprehensive strategy that focuses on investigation, prosecution, and prevention efforts to address violence in America.
