By September 30, 2015, working with federal, state, local, and tribal partners, protect potential victims from abuse and exploitation through three sets of key indicators:


	Open investigations concerning non-compliant sex offenders (4% over average of FYs 2012, 2013), sexual exploitation of children (3% over average of FYs 2011, 2012, 2013), and human trafficking (2% over FY 2013).
	Open litigation matters concerning sexual exploitation of children and human trafficking (5% increase over baseline (TBD))
	Percent of children recovered within 72 hours of issuance of an AMBER alert (90%)

</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>The abuse, neglect, exploitation, and trafficking of children, the elderly, and other vulnerable populations, causes irrevocable harm to victims and society.&amp;nbsp; Ensuring that our children, seniors, and all citizens can live without being disturbed by sexual trauma, physical abuse, or financial exploitation is more than a criminal justice issue; it is a societal and moral imperative.&amp;nbsp; Despite efforts to date, the threat of these crimes remains very real.&amp;nbsp; In the broadest terms, the goal of the Department of Justice (the Department or DOJ) is to prevent child sexual exploitation, elder abuse, and human trafficking from occurring in the first place, in order to protect every person from the physical and mental traumas associated with these crimes.

The Department surpassed its 2-year targets for its three investigations performance goals. Achieve a 5% increase in open investigations concerning non-compliant sex offenders exceeded its 2 year target (1,841) by 26 for a total of 1,867; and exceeded its FY 2015 4th quarter target (424) by 27 for a total of 451. Open investigations concerning sexual exploitation of children exceeded its 2-year target (3,051) by 5,680 for a total of 8,731; and surpassed it FY 2015 4th quarter target (763) by 270%. Open investigations of human trafficking exceeded its 2-year target (218) by 47 for a total of 265; and achieved 98%, 53 open investigations, of its FY 2015 4th quarter target (55). The FBI’s numerous global investigations resulted in an increase of child sexual exploitation cases. The FBI engaged in extensive training and media efforts which, in addition to its strong network of law enforcement partners, also resulted in the surge of opened cases. The FBI also had several successful operations contribute to the increase in open cases. For example, FBI’s “Operation Pacifier” generated over 1,100 leads in the last half of 2015, many of which led to open investigations. The combination of all these efforts directly led to the dramatic rise in open investigations concerning sexual investigations. The FBI’s success stemmed from its efforts to provide training and education programs to raise awareness and expertise surrounding human trafficking.

For the two litigation performance measures, DOJ exceeded its 2-year target (5,424) for achieve a 5% increase in litigation matters concerning the sexual exploitation of children by 360 for a total of 5,784; realizing 1,575 open litigation matters in the 4th quarter of FY 2015. The Department achieved 89% or 152, of its 2-year target (171) for achieve a 5% increase in litigation matters concerning human trafficking; opening 23 litigation matters in Q4. The missed target reflects a temporary fluctuation due to a delay in transitioning new-matter intake duties to the newly hired investigator within the Department’s Civil Rights Division/Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit. Moving forward, the Department will continue its efforts to proactively identify and assist human trafficking victims producing high-impact prosecutions resulting in the conviction of traffickers and the dismantling of trafficking organizations. To further these efforts, the Department announced Phase II of the Anti-Trafficking Coordination Team (ACTeam) Pilot Program, in 2015. DOJ remains committed to the safety and well-being of children. Recent cases brought as part of Project Safe Childhood have resulted in convictions of child sex offenders; including the recent convictions of Yusef Yunosovich Abramov; a Los Angeles man convicted of sexually abusing minors while In Russia, and Patrick Killean, Jr. who was sentenced to 139 years in prison for producing, distributing and possessing child pornography and extortion.

For the sixth performance measure, percent of children recovered within 72 hours of issuance of an AMBER alert, DOJ exceeded its target of 90%, with an annual average of 94.6%. The AMBER Alert program has been extremely successful; the Department continuously exceeds its quarterly target.

Milestones

Elder Abuse: “DOJ will lead an interagency working group to increase the identification of crimes against the elderly in order to formulate a collaborative strategy to address these crimes by the end of FY 2015. In FY15/Q4, the Bureau of Statistics (BJS) will complete a pilot assessment of criminal victimization of the elderly and disabled adults living in institutionalized group quarters.” •


	Not Complete – The assessment is currently underway, however the completion has been delayed until FY 2017, due to survey work obstacles relating to gaining access to nursing homes for adults with disabilities.


Improve the federal response to the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native children: “The American Indian and Alaska Native Children Exposed to Violence Task Force working group will focus on actions to improve the federal response to the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native children exposed to violence. In FY15/Q4, a cross-agency working group, including representatives from DOJ, will be reactivated under the GenI initiative. The working group will track the factsheets disseminated at the Tribal Youth event held in July.”


	Complete – A cross-agency working group, including DOJ, was reactivated under the White House-led GenI initiative. The working group updated the Tribal Youth factsheet for the annual White House Tribal Nations Conference, which was held on November 4-5, 2015.


Human Trafficking victim services: “DOJ, with Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Homeland Security (DHS) will provide leadership to identify human trafficking victim services needed at the federal, regional, state, territorial, tribal, and local levels, as well as support interagency collaboration and communication aimed at enhancing federal agency victim services. In FY15/Q4, the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) will release a Georgetown University study of the effectiveness of interventions to stabilize, rehabilitate, and integrate foreign national victims of human trafficking in the wider society, and a Colorado College study that assesses the elements of state-level legislation that are most effective at improving successful prosecutions. Also in Q4, in conjunction with the rule revisions for the Victims of Crime Act Assistance and Compensation Programs, the Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) will revise grantee and sub-grantee data collection forms which will, for the first time, include human trafficking, where appropriate. OVC will coordinate with the Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) to align grantee guidance on new data collection instruments, as closely as possible.”


	Not Complete – The release of the Georgetown Study has been delayed until December 2015.&amp;nbsp;
	Complete – OVC worked with OVW and HHS/Family Violence and Prevention Services (FVPSA) to align Victims of Crime Act grantee reporting with the reporting required by these two agencies.

Contributing programs or partners outside the agency


	Task forces with state, local, and tribal law enforcement throughout the country will work to stop those who prey on our most vulnerable citizens.&amp;nbsp; Examples of such organizations include Department-funded Internet Crimes Against Children Task Forces, Project Safe Childhood coalitions, and the FBI led Innocence Lost task forces which are aimed at combatting the domestic commercial sexual exploitation of children.
	DHS, through Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Secret Service, conducts joint investigations with the Department in the child exploitation area.&amp;nbsp; DHS also refers cases to the Department for prosecution in the child exploitation and human trafficking areas.
	U.S. Postal Inspection Service conducts joint investigations with the Department in the child exploitation area and refers cases in this area to the Department for prosecution.
	Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division (WHD) and Office of the Inspector General actively work alongside law enforcement partners in six pilot Anti-trafficking Coordination Teams located throughout the country.&amp;nbsp; WHD also is participating in DOJ-funded and other anti-trafficking task forces throughout the country.
	HHS, while not a law enforcement partner, plays a key role in supporting victims of human trafficking, including by certifying foreign victims so such victims can receive federally-funded benefits and services.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>The Department embraces its historic role in keeping America safe by fighting crime, protecting civil rights, preserving the environment, ensuring fairness in the market place, and defending and representing the interests of the United States.  Accordingly, Goal 2 encompasses what is viewed as the traditional missions of DOJ: enforcing and upholding federal law.
 
From the violent gangs in our cities and suburbs, to sophisticated financial fraud schemes that threaten the financial security of all citizens, to the flow of drugs across the Southwest Border and the associated violent crime, the Department’s law enforcement mission is as complex and varied as it has ever been in its history.  Goal 2 covers this broad range of law enforcement issues, including violent crime, illegal drugs, criminal gangs, and gun violence.  It includes white collar crimes, such as health care fraud, corporate fraud, and public corruption.  It also includes computer crime, identity theft, IP crime, and other kinds of crime facilitated by computer networks.  In addition, it covers the exploitation of vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly.  This goal also includes enforcing federal civil and criminal statutes that protect civil rights, safeguard the environment, preserve a competitive market structure, and preserve the integrity of the Nation’s bankruptcy system.
 
Goal 2 addresses the role of the Department as the Nation’s largest law office and chief litigator, which involves representing hundreds of United States’ agencies, offices, and employees and defending against myriad challenges to federal laws, programs, and policies.  This work is critical to protecting the federal fisc against unwarranted monetary claims and to ensuring the United States can continue to protect the Nation’s security, maintain civil law and order, and enhance public safety.

</objective_statement><objective_overview>The Department must continue to be vigilant in supporting and protecting the most vulnerable segments of our population that may fall victim to crime.  Children are the most vulnerable and most exploited members of our society.  The criminal victimization of children impacts not only the children, but also their families, community, and society at large.
 
Unfortunately, children are but one segment of society that is at risk.  In the United States and across the globe, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, human trafficking, and stalking occur in all ages, races, socioeconomic classes, genders, and sexual orientations.  Research shows that these crimes are overwhelmingly committed against women.  In addition, elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation is an area that has been overlooked but research suggests it is an ongoing problem in the United States.  Further, victims of crime committed on tribal lands is also an area that has been overlooked for far too long as research suggests violent crime rates may be two, four, and in some cases, 10 times the national average.
 
The Department continues to stress efforts to reduce and respond to violence against vulnerable populations.  In April of 2013, the Department issued a revised Sexual Assault Forensic Examination Protocol to standardize up-to-date approaches to victim-centered forensic medical examinations.  DOJ will also work with the FBI to support states’ implementation of the revised Uniform Crime Report definition of “rape.”  As part of the Attorney General’s Defending Childhood Initiative, the Department will: launch a public awareness and community action campaign to stem youth violence; establish a Task Force on American Indian/Alaska Native Children Exposed to Violence; and partner with select states to form “State Commissions” that will implement model public policy initiatives at the state and local level to reduce the impact of children’s exposure to violence.
 
All victims deserve to be treated with respect and support.  The Department will address the needs of victims by investigating and prosecuting matters impacting vulnerable groups while leading the way in providing innovative training, resources, and support to victims of crime.
