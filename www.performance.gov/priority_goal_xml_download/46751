</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>FEMA continues to allocate resources to supplement whole community investment to prepare for the greatest challenge in emergency management—a catastrophic disaster. In order to successfully respond to and recover from a catastrophic event, the whole community, including FEMA, state and local governments, and individuals that may be affected, need to build and sustain capabilities and implement the National Preparedness System to achieve the National Preparedness Goal of a secure and resilient Nation.&amp;nbsp;

In order to achieve this goal, FEMA has implemented activities and programs that assist in&amp;nbsp; addressing gaps in state and local planning efforts, improved the governance, coordination structures, and guidance for managing the Agency’s incident workforce, and designed and delivered accessible information and tools to promote collective actions and empower grassroots problem solving.

•&amp;nbsp;In Quarter Four, FEMA will finalize the analysis of calendar year 2015 Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment and State Preparedness Report data at the national level to identify trends in national preparedness.
•&amp;nbsp;In Quarter Four, FEMA will offer national-level data on state capabilities to over 26 Federal agencies and 15 FEMA programs to help refine, develop, and implement preparedness programs and initiatives such as training, exercise, and planning support.
•&amp;nbsp;In Quarter Four, FEMA will complete a review of the implementation of the Plan to Reduce Disaster Administrative Costs. FEMA will focus on improving its administrative cost reporting capabilities, and preparing for the November 30, 2016 Report to Congress on Disaster Administrative Costs, required by the Directing Dollars to Disaster Relief Act of 2015 signed into law on February 29, 2016.
•&amp;nbsp;In Quarter Four, the Individuals and Households Program Unified Guidance will be published to provide FEMA employees, emergency management partners, political leadership, and the public with a single, comprehensive reference containing policy statements and eligibility criteria for all forms of Individuals and Households Program assistance. This guidance replaces existing stand-alone policies and provides State, Territory, and Indian Tribal Government officials a concise reference tool to assist with the needs of disaster survivors in their jurisdiction.
•&amp;nbsp;In FY17, the measure “Operational readiness rating of FEMA’s specialized incident workforce cadres” will be revised to capture the input elements of readiness, emergency response staffing and position qualification.

</next_steps><progress_update>•&amp;nbsp;FEMA conducts an analysis of state, urban area, territory, and tribal Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment submissions to determine alignment to Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 201 Second Edition:&amp;nbsp; Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment Guide. In FY16, forty-eight out of 56 states and territories met all steps of the guidance (85.7 percent). Ten states and territories performed better in FY16 as compared to FY15. This analysis prioritizes technical assistance provided to states and territories to help them improve their THIRA submission.
•&amp;nbsp;The National Exercise Program continued to encourage participation by private and non-profit organizations, and other whole community partners. Thirteen exercises out of thirty-three involved substantive participation from private and non-profit organizations, for a 39 percent result this Quarter.
•&amp;nbsp;FEMA analyzed results from staffing, training, and equipping readiness categories from the Cadre Operational Readiness and Deployability Status Report to assess whether the FEMA workforce is positioned to respond to all hazards. Quarter Three results represent an increase of four percent from Quarter Two (58 percent).
•&amp;nbsp;FEMA continues to implement its Plan to Reduce Disaster Administrative Costs. Projects in the Plan that made progress this quarter include:&amp;nbsp; moving disaster spend plan data into the Enterprise Data Warehouse and continuing progress on measures of disaster effectiveness. FEMA also briefed congressional stakeholders on its Plan to Reduce Disaster Administrative Costs this quarter.
•&amp;nbsp;FEMA produced an Individual Assistance Shared Costs Programs video supporting Objective 2.5 (Improve efficiency and effectiveness of Individual Assistance programs). This video informs external emergency managers and Reservists of the programs FEMA shares costs with under the Individual Assistance, Individuals and Households Program. The video specifically covers Other Needs Assistance (ONA), Critical Needs Assistance (CNA) and Transitional Sheltering Assistance (TSA). The video explains the purpose of these programs, how and when they are implemented (as CNA and TSA are not implemented for every disaster, the State or Tribal government must request them) and provides a general overview of the eligibility requirements.
•&amp;nbsp;All revised Individuals and Households Program (IHP) letters for disaster survivors have been implemented, starting with West Virginia Severe Storms, Flooding, Landslides, and Mudslides (DR-4273. The letters were written in plain language and revised to ensure content matches current FEMA policies, procedures, and doctrine. As a result, not only do the letter revisions contribute to providing clearer and more concise information to disaster survivors, it also supports an exponential cost savings to the government by reducing the use of printing and shipping materials. For example, the initial IHP packet sent to applicants has been reduced from 40 pages to 5 pages.
•&amp;nbsp;On June 1, 2016, FEMA completed a Memorandum of Agreement with the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) for out-of-sequence declarations. This agreement facilitates SBA making a declaration under its own authority and providing loans to disaster survivors in instances when a state may be appealing its initial denial for a presidential declaration, allowing FEMA to directly address any potential duplication of benefits.
•&amp;nbsp;FEMA successfully implemented Phase 1 of the Continued Temporary Housing Assistance (CTHA) improvement recommendations from the Office of Chief Counsel. Phase 1 consisted of developing a communication product, a procedural change, and a system modification to prevent unnecessary CTHA requests and redirect outreach for survivors who are most in need. Through this process FEMA is able to more efficiently triage CTHA requests and minimize unnecessary casework or handle-times for FEMA agents.
