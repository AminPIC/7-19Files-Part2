</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Serious mental illnesses often first arise in adolescence or early adulthood, and delays in treatment initiation are common.&amp;nbsp; As a result, people with serious mental illness (SMI) may experience multiple episodes of acute illness accompanied by accumulating disability.&amp;nbsp; The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) estimates that the direct and indirect financial costs of serious mental illness—including health expenditures, disability benefits, and loss of earnings—exceed $300 billion per year in the United States.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) are a high-need, high-cost population.&amp;nbsp; They are frequent utilizers of emergency departments and have high rates of readmission to inpatient care, especially when co-occurring substance use disorders are present.&amp;nbsp; In addition, people with SMI often have co-morbid physical health conditions and shorter life expectancies than people without SMI, primarily due to co-occurring physical health conditions that too often go unaddressed.
Individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) often experience barriers to treatment, including difficulty accessing and initiating treatment.&amp;nbsp; Significant delays in the identification and treatment of SMI are common; for example, research has repeatedly found that individuals with psychosis in the U.S. often do not receive appropriate treatment for that condition for one to three years.&amp;nbsp; Moreover, once they do receive care, individuals with serious mental illness might not receive evidence-based care, or care that is coordinated with medical care.&amp;nbsp; There is a growing body of evidence highlighting the effectiveness of early intervention using evidence-based treatments to improve outcomes for individuals with SMI, including psychotherapy and education and employment supports.&amp;nbsp; The use of peer supports is another promising practice with a growing evidence base.&amp;nbsp;

Challenges that prevent the dissemination of these best practices in the provision of early intervention services include lack of funding, the need for technical assistance, the need to educate and engage consumers, and the need to further build the evidence base supporting the provision of early intervention services.&amp;nbsp; These challenges impact the ability of states to establish and maintain early intervention programs using Community Mental Health Services Block Grant funding.

The SMI Initiative builds on activities that are currently underway in various HHS agencies; these activities are coordinated through the HHS Behavioral Health Coordinating Council (BHCC).&amp;nbsp; The BHCC subcommittee on SMI is critical to the implementation of the Initiative, which is also oriented towards achievement of this Agency Priority Goal on SMI.

Salient next steps include continuing to include the Mental Health Block Grant Set-Aside, which clearly sets access to early intervention services as a priority.&amp;nbsp; Please note that in FY2016, the set-aside was increased from 5 to 10 percent.&amp;nbsp; In addition to dedicated funding, technical assistance is critical; technical assistance that is currently available through mechanisms such as Technical Assistance to Support the Implementation of Coordinated Specialty Care Programs for First Episode Psychosis via the Community Mental Health Services Block Grant program will continue to be offered.&amp;nbsp; In addition, the NIMH Early Psychosis Intervention Network (EPINET)—a learning healthcare network for coordinated specialty care clinics that offer early intervention services—is under development.&amp;nbsp; The initial phase is nearing completion; in the initial phase, standardized performance measures that can be used for fidelity monitoring and quality improvement activities were identified.
</next_steps><progress_update>~~From a baseline of 13 states in 2015, the number of states with evidence-based early intervention programs for individuals with serious mental illness funded through the Mental Health Services Block Grant increased to 25 states as of September 30, 2016.
&amp;nbsp;
In addition to the 25 states that have at least one fully implemented evidence-based early intervention program for individuals with serious mental illness, 16 states are currently in the process of implementing evidence-based programs.&amp;nbsp; Ten states are still in the planning phase.

Individuals with serious mental illness are disproportionally likely to experience housing instability.&amp;nbsp; Stable housing can be a key part of recovery.&amp;nbsp; In fiscal year 2015, the SAMHSA Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness (PATH) program outreached to 181,336 individuals experiencing homelessness.&amp;nbsp; Sixty percent of individuals with serious mental illness who engaged with outreach efforts agreed to engage in the program.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, 53 percent of enrolled individuals were experiencing a co-occurring substance use disorder.&amp;nbsp; In addition, PATH assisted 17,232 individuals with addressing complex housing needs and referred 25,911 individuals to housing assistance agencies in their communities.&amp;nbsp; The services provided by the PATH program fill gaps in existing community resources and play a crucial role in communities’ strategic plans to end homelessness.

The Cooperative Agreements to Benefit Homeless Individuals (CABHI) program is another SAMSHA initiative that serves many individuals with serious mental illness.&amp;nbsp; Thirty CABHI applications were recently funded, including three states, 12 local governments, and 15 community-based organizations.&amp;nbsp; CABHI grants will increase the capacity to provide accessible, effective, comprehensive, coordinated, integrated, and evidence-based treatment services; permanent supportive housing; peer supports; and other critical services.

The SAMHSA SOAR technical assistance center launched a learning community and pilot with 12 states that received the Cooperative Agreement to Benefit Homeless Individuals (CABHI) States Enhancement Grant.&amp;nbsp; Four of these states also receive support through the SAMHSA Supported Employment grant program.&amp;nbsp; The recently launched CABHI: SOAR and IPS Pilot is a year-long pilot that aims to integrate SOAR and Individual Placement and Support (IPS) employment services.&amp;nbsp; The goal is connecting individuals receiving income support services from one or both programs with the appropriate services.

Individuals with serious mental illness are at increased risk for suicide.&amp;nbsp; Zero Suicide is a commitment, a goal, and a campaign led by the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention and its partners, and supported by NIMH.&amp;nbsp; The Zero Suicide effort seeks to improve the ability within the health care systems to identify who is at risk, as well as to identify and implement effective treatments for at-risk individuals.&amp;nbsp; Optimally, these improvements will also encourage the development of ‘learning health care systems’ by promoting agility in how health care providers can reduce suicide risk.&amp;nbsp; NIMH recently funded three studies focused on adult and youth based suicide prevention practices in health care settings.
</progress_update><themes></themes><contributing_programs_and_other_factors>~~Related initiatives and programs include the SAMHSA Mental Health Block Grant (MHBG) 5 percent Set-Aside, the SAMHSA Healthy Transitions program, the SAMHSA National Child Traumatic Stress Initiative (NCTSI), the SAMHSA Primary and Behavioral Health Integration (PBHCI) program, and the Medicaid Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHC) demonstration program that is being launched by SAMHSA and CMS.&amp;nbsp; Technical assistance is available through programs such as the Technical Assistance to Support the Implementation of Coordinated Specialty Care Programs for First Episode Psychosis via the Community Mental Health Services Block Grant program.
Several different agencies have critical roles in pursuing the SMI APG, including Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the National Institute of Mental Health in the National Institutes of Health, the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, the Administration for Community Living, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.
