</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>Problem or opportunity being addressed

The inspection of high risk producing oil and gas cases is paramount to help ensure that hydrocarbon production on federally managed lands are properly accounted for and results in accurate royalty payments to the public and Indian owners of such minerals.Oil and gas production on federally supervised lands represent a significant part of the nation’s hydrocarbon production.Operating regulations at 43 CFR 3161.3 (a) require the BLM to inspect all leases which produce high volumes of oil or natural gas and those leases that have a history of non-compliance at least once a year.The high risk cases are determined by four risk factors: production rating; number of missing Oil and Gas Operations Reports (OGOR); non-compliance rating; and, last production inspection date rating.



This effort is a component of addressing the deficiencies identified in the GAO High Risk report, which identified the areas for needed improvement including:




	ensuring data on production verification and royalties are consistent and reliable,
	meeting goals for oil and gas verification inspections, and
	ensuring that informal employee training is supported by formalized training courses offered on a consistent basis.


Relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives

Achieving a high rate of inspecting high risk producing cases will advance the BLM’s mission by ensuring that oil and gas operations are conducted in compliance with lease terms, with the regulations in title 43 CFR 3161.3 (a), and all other applicable regulations.&amp;nbsp; The BLM is charged, in Section 101. (a) of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982, with procedures to ensure that each federal and Indian lease site which is producing or is expected to produce significant quantities of oil or gas in any year or which has a history of non-compliance be inspected at least once annually.

Key barriers and challenges 

The Bureau is limited in its ability to meet the requirement of inspecting all high risk cases by the number of certified inspectors available to inspect these cases.&amp;nbsp; Competing priorities take time from these inspectors in completing high risk production inspections.&amp;nbsp; High&amp;nbsp;priority drilling and abandonment inspections must be completed prior to high risk production inspections.&amp;nbsp; In addition the Bureau has historically had a high turnover of certified inspectors.

Stakeholder Engagement

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Department of the Interior Office of Inspector General (OIG) has pointed out the failure of the BLM to adequately ensure production of federal and Indian minerals.&amp;nbsp; The BLM answered the requests from both the GAO and OIG.&amp;nbsp; This Priority Goal was created to help address some of the identified concerns while providing a forum by which the Department can continue to track the progress toward addressing the other concerns identified by GAO.&amp;nbsp; The goal was developed in concert with the White House and released with the President’s FY 2013 Budget.

Significance of the Accomplishment (through the Priority Goal) especially in relation to past experience and benefit to the public

As a part of addressing weaknesses in the Department’s oil and gas programs identified in GAO’s High Risk list, a risk-based strategy has been effectively implemented for determining which oil and gas cases need to be inspected each year.&amp;nbsp; This risk-based strategy has been providing managers in the field the means by which to better determine where production inspections are most needed through scoring of pre-defined criteria including production volumes, previous violations, time since last inspection, and missing Oil and Gas Operations Reports.

The Field Offices inspect the cases throughout the year&amp;nbsp;and the inspection results are then entered into the Automated Fluid Minerals Support System (AFMSS).&amp;nbsp; The Washington Office then runs reports from AFMSS showing the number of high risk production inspections completed. The respective Field Office Managers have the lead responsibility for the accomplishment of the inspection goals.&amp;nbsp; The Washington Office, Chief, Division of Fluid Minerals has the responsibility for providing oversight and policy to the inspection program.

Contributing programs or partners outside the agency

The BLM is responsible for the inspection of all federal and Indian oil and gas operations.&amp;nbsp; Other surface management agencies such as the Forest Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the US Fish and Wildlife Service may help in determining surface use risks.&amp;nbsp; These agencies report surface incidents of non-compliance to the local BLM field offices when discovered.&amp;nbsp; The Office of Natural Resources Revenue does provide production data to the Bureau in the completion of inspections.&amp;nbsp; Partners outside the Federal government that routinely report similar incidents are the respective State oil and gas inspection agencies and Indian Tribal inspectors.
