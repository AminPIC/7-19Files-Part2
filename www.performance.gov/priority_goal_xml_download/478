</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>The recent financial crisis, which has impacted every American, has resulted in fraud and deception in the finance and housing markets as well as fraudulent schemes that misuse the public’s unprecedented investment in economic recovery.&amp;nbsp; Criminals who commit mortgage fraud, securities and commodities fraud, and other types of fraud relating to the response to the economic crisis, victimize the American public as a whole.&amp;nbsp; Similarly, those who defraud Medicare, Medicaid, and other government health care programs defraud every American.&amp;nbsp; In particular, health care fraudsters take critical resources out of our health care system—thus contributing to the rising cost of health care for all Americans and endangering the short-term and long-term solvency of these essential health care programs.&amp;nbsp; The Department will continue to address these critical problems by vigorously investigating and prosecuting both health care fraud and financial fraud, in order to protect American businesses, consumers, and taxpayers.

Through the end of 4th quarter FY 2015, the number of pending investigations was 4,801. The goal for this measure is to be at or below the annual target. The end-of-year 4th quarter actual figure is 4% below the FY 2015 annual target of 4,997. Moreover, the FY 2015 end-of-year actual is 7% below the FY 2013 baseline figure of 5,152 for this priority goal. Over the past two years, the numbers have&amp;nbsp;trended&amp;nbsp;downward due to greater awareness of the “aging matters” by United States Attorney Offices (USAOs). The data concerning health care fraud and financial fraud matters which have been pending for 24 months or more are now posted on each USAO’s internal data page. The data page is updated on a quarterly basis.

Milestone: EOUSA will develop a brief video for USAO financial fraud and healthcare fraud coordinators to update them on the status of the goal, and ask the coordinators to review their districts’ aging matter data on the Data Analysis website. The video will be posted on the EOUSA intranet.

• Met - The taping of the video was completed in 4th quarter and has been posted in the EOUSA Intranet site. In addition, all financial-healthcare fraud coordinators were notified through e-mail reminding them of the importance of reviewing their aged pending case loads.

Milestone: CRM will develop an open investigations quality check in the Division’s Performance Dashboard. This will provide an easy to read, real-time user interface, which will enable informed decisions to be made.

• Completed - CRM completed (2nd quarter) the automation of real-time reporting of financial and healthcare fraud investigations pending longer than 2 years through CRM’s Performance Dashboard.

Overall, the Department will continue to vigorously investigate and prosecute both financial fraud and health care fraud related cases, in order to protect American businesses, consumers, and taxpayers. In September 2015, the Department issued a new policy guidance to all Department prosecutors and civil litigators to require that, if a company wants any credit for cooperation, it must identify all individuals involved in the wrongdoing, regardless of their position, status, or seniority in the company, and provide all relevant facts about their misconduct. Fundamentally, this guidance ensures that all Department attorneys are consistent in using our best efforts to hold individual wrongdoers accountable.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>The Department embraces its historic role in keeping America safe by fighting crime, protecting civil rights, preserving the environment, ensuring fairness in the market place, and defending and representing the interests of the United States.  Accordingly, Goal 2 encompasses what is viewed as the traditional missions of DOJ: enforcing and upholding federal law.
 
From the violent gangs in our cities and suburbs, to sophisticated financial fraud schemes that threaten the financial security of all citizens, to the flow of drugs across the Southwest Border and the associated violent crime, the Department’s law enforcement mission is as complex and varied as it has ever been in its history.  Goal 2 covers this broad range of law enforcement issues, including violent crime, illegal drugs, criminal gangs, and gun violence.  It includes white collar crimes, such as health care fraud, corporate fraud, and public corruption.  It also includes computer crime, identity theft, IP crime, and other kinds of crime facilitated by computer networks.  In addition, it covers the exploitation of vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly.  This goal also includes enforcing federal civil and criminal statutes that protect civil rights, safeguard the environment, preserve a competitive market structure, and preserve the integrity of the Nation’s bankruptcy system.
 
Goal 2 addresses the role of the Department as the Nation’s largest law office and chief litigator, which involves representing hundreds of United States’ agencies, offices, and employees and defending against myriad challenges to federal laws, programs, and policies.  This work is critical to protecting the federal fisc against unwarranted monetary claims and to ensuring the United States can continue to protect the Nation’s security, maintain civil law and order, and enhance public safety.

</objective_statement><objective_overview>The Nation’s recent economic crisis has had significant and devastating effects on mortgage markets, credit markets, and the banking system.  The Department will protect Americans from the financial fraud and corruption that devastates consumers, siphons taxpayer dollars, weakens our markets, and impedes our ongoing economic recovery.  The impact of financial crime is not confined to Wall Street – and many times the victims of fraud have worked hard and played by established investment rules, only to see their retirement and life savings vanish at the hands of white-collar criminals.  Additionally, the rapid expansion of Internet use throughout the Nation, including business and government, creates a continually growing risk of unlawful acts.  The Department will focus its white collar enforcement resources on these areas of potential fraud and associated corruption.
 
These offenses represent separate and very severe threats to the United States’ economy.  The corruption of federal, state, and locally elected, appointed, or contracted officials, whether foreign or domestic, undermines democratic institutions and may threaten the condition of the economy, public safety, and national security, while wasting many taxpayer dollars.  As businesses, governments, educational institutions, and individual citizens continue to integrate the Internet and other global network computer systems, extortionists, hostile insiders, identity thieves, and other criminals have new opportunities and new venues to commit unlawful acts.  The increased presence of fraud such as corporate fraud, securities fraud, healthcare fraud, and mortgage fraud have escalated and will continue to hamper economic recovery and persist long after any recovery occurs.  IP crime poses a grave threat to the country’s economic well-being, as well as the health and safety of U.S. citizens.  Finally, transnational crime has expanded dramatically in size, scope, and influence, and transnational criminal networks pose a significant threat to national and international security.  In response, the Department will implement actions to support the Administration’s Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime, which seeks to build, balance, and integrate the tools of American power to combat transnational organized crime and related threats to national security and urge America’s foreign partners to do the same.
 
The Department will pursue fraud and corruption committed against the Federal Government and state and local governments and their programs and will protect consumers through vigorous investigations and civil and criminal enforcement of federal laws.  These efforts will return significant amounts to the Treasury, Medicare, and other entitlement programs every year and provide deterrence to those contemplating defrauding federal programs, businesses, and individual citizens.
