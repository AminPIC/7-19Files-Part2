</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>
In the Better Buying Power (BBP) initiative announced in September 2010, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD(AT&amp;amp;L)) directed the acquisition professionals in DoD to deliver better value to the taxpayer and warfighter by&amp;nbsp;improving the way DoD &amp;nbsp;does business. Next to supporting the Armed Forces at war, he stated that this was the President’s and Secretary of Defense’s highest priority for DoD’s acquisition professionals.&amp;nbsp;USD(AT&amp;amp;L) pointed out their continuing responsibility to procure the critical goods and services U.S. Armed Forces need in the years ahead without having ever-increasing budgets to pay for them. It has taken years for&amp;nbsp;excessive costs and unproductive overhead to creep into DoD’s business practices. The roadmap for addressing these problems includes targeting affordability, controlling cost growth, and promoting real competition.&amp;nbsp;The USD(AT&amp;amp;L) re-emphasized the management philosophy of continued improvement when he introduced Better Buying Power 2.0 in November 2012.&amp;nbsp;This announcement encompassed 36 initiatives organized into seven focus areas, and included a new focus area that reflected the importance of the total acquisition workforce.&amp;nbsp;The basic goal of BBP; however, remains unchanged: deliver better value to the taxpayer and Warfighter by improving the way the Department does business.

The&amp;nbsp;key challenge for DoD&amp;nbsp;is to put its acquisition programs on&amp;nbsp;sound footing from their beginning. DoD can guard against cost growth by ensuring a match between requirements and resources when the APB is established at program initiation or Milestone B. In other words, acquisition programs begin with mature technologies, adequate funding and personnel resources, and sufficient time to finish product development. Also, requirements must be achievable given those resource constraints and must be agreed upon and remain largely intact throughout the product development phase. DoD must guard against so-called “requirements creep.” Furthermore, disciplined and constant oversight is needed. The Services and program managers (PMs) also need to overcome any shortcomings in staff capabilities to perform the kind of portfolio analyses and systems engineering tradeoff analyses that would strengthen DoD’s ability to understand and control future costs from a program’s inception. Regarding competition, the most common reason for DoD&amp;nbsp;noncompetitive awards is that one contractor is the only responsible source for &amp;nbsp;the procurement. The challenge for DoD&amp;nbsp;is to support and strengthen the supplier base to give the Government more supply options. The second most common reason is “authorized by statute.” For&amp;nbsp;example, awards under the Small Business Administration’s 8(a) business development program.

The Department of Defense has made progress towards the &quot;Reform the DOD Acquisition Process&quot; agency priority goal.&amp;nbsp; The Department continued to assess the 2015 performance results and ensured appropriate corrective actions were taken.&amp;nbsp;

In 2015, for Major Defense Acquisition Programs there were no Nunn-McCurdy cost breaches, and the median cycle time change from the approved baseline as well as the average rate of cost growth met or exceeded performance expectations.&amp;nbsp; The Department continues work to improve competition through the Better Buying Power initiatives by including competition as a recurring agenda item at Business Senior Integration Group (B-SIG) meetings.&amp;nbsp; Senior leaders and acquisition executives continue to focus on competitions results, trends and guidance/best practices to increase competition.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

On September 16, 2015, the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, Mr. Frank Kendall released the third annual report on the Performance of the Defense Acquisition System to provide data and analysis so the Department of Defense can see how it is doing, measure the effectiveness of ongoing efforts to improve acquisition, and learn from past experience.&amp;nbsp; This third annual report is available to view at: http://www.acq.osd.mil/fo/docs/Performance-of-Defense-Acquisition-System-2015.pdf&amp;nbsp;

_______________________________________________________________________________

Of four measures under “Reform the DoD Acquisition Process,” three measures met the FY2015,&amp;nbsp;4th quarter targets, and one measure missed its target:

Number of Major Defense Acquisition Program breaches: At the end of the&amp;nbsp;fourth quarter of FY 2015, the Department met its target, as there were no&amp;nbsp; cost breaches in the&amp;nbsp;fourth quarter for&amp;nbsp; reasons other than approved changes in quantity.

Median percent increase from the approved APB cycle time: (Target: less than 2%; Result: 0%). At the end of the&amp;nbsp;fourth quarter, the Department continues to meet performance expectations.

Percentage of contract obligations that are competitively awarded: (Target 56%; Result: 52.4%)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; USD (AT&amp;amp;L) continues to emphasize the importance of maximizing opportunities for competitive contracting.&amp;nbsp; Most recently at his June 25, 2015, Business Senior Integration Group (B-SIG) meeting, USD (AT&amp;amp;L) had the Service Acquisition Executives present progress to date.&amp;nbsp; At the B-SIG, the Services attributed difficulties with achieving their goals to high value sole source FMS and “Bridge” contracts having a significant impact on the FY15 competition rates.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, they indicated that contracts for major non-competitive shipbuilding and aviation programs driven by historical strategic decisions made years ago will continue to impact competition for the long term.&amp;nbsp; The Services are conducting engagements at the Component and Command levels with the “Requirements”, “Acquisition” and “Contracting” communities.&amp;nbsp; Army, in partnership with DAU, is planning the first Army-wide competition training workshop. Based on current projections, the Department does not anticipate making the FY15 goal.

The average percent cost increase for MDAPs was 0.41%. At the end of the&amp;nbsp;fourth quarter, the Department continues to meet performance expectations.

The success in achieving these targets may be directly linked to the Better Buying Power (BBP) initiative announced by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD (AT&amp;amp;L)) in September 2010, and re-emphasized in the November 2012 memorandum introducing Better Buying Power 2.0.

Of four measures under “Reform the DoD Acquisition Process,” three measures met the FY2015,&amp;nbsp;3rd quarter targets, and one measure missed its target:

Number of Major Defense Acquisition Program breaches:&amp;nbsp; At the end of the&amp;nbsp;third quarter of FY 2015, the Department met its target, as there were no cost breaches in the&amp;nbsp;third quarter for reasons other than approved changes in quantity.

Median percent increase from the approved APB cycle time: (Target: less than 2%; Result: 0%). At the end of the&amp;nbsp;third quarter, the Department continues to meet performance expectations.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

Percentage of contract obligations that are competitively awarded: (Target 53%; Result: 51%) While the Department did not achieve the second quarter target of 53%, the competition rate made a notable improvement from 46.9% in the first quarter to 51.0% for the second quarter.&amp;nbsp; Senior leaders and acquisition executives continue to focus on competitions results, trends and guidance/best practices to increase competition.&amp;nbsp; At the February 19, 2015 B-SIG, the Air Force, Army, and Navy senior leaders addressed their competition results and respective efforts to improve competition.&amp;nbsp; In the second quarter noncompetitive procurements for critical weapons systems and Foreign Military Sales buys continued to affect the Department's competition achievement.

The average percent cost increase for MDAPs was 0.30%. At the end of the&amp;nbsp;third quarter, the Department continues to meet performance expectations.

The success in achieving these targets&amp;nbsp;may be directly linked to the Better Buying Power (BBP) initiative announced by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD(AT&amp;amp;L)) in September 2010, and re-emphasized in the November 2012 memorandum introducing Better Buying Power 2.0.

</progress_update><themes><theme>National Defense</theme></themes><contributing_programs_and_other_factors>DoD’s Military Departments – the Air Force, Army, and Navy – and Defense Agencies have a portfolio of about 81 ongoing major defense acquisition programs (MDAPs). MDAPs are defined as acquisitions having a dollar value estimated to require an eventual total expenditure for &amp;nbsp;research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&amp;amp;E) of more than $480 million in FY2014 constant dollars or, for procurement, of more than $2.79 billion in FY2014 constant dollars.

Of the MDAPs, DoD&amp;nbsp;categorizes nearly 38 as ACAT 1Ds because they are of special interest based on one or &amp;nbsp;more of the following factors: technological complexity; Congressional interest; a large commitment of resources; criticality to achievement of a capability; or a joint (multi- Service) program. DoD categorizes the remaining 43 MDAPs as ACAT 1Cs. In FY2013 dollars, the total planned investment in these MDAPs was about $1.7 trillion as of December 31, 2013.

The key partners outside of DoD are other countries. They participate in international cooperative programs, which are acquisition programs or technology projects that include participation by one or more foreign nations, through international agreements, during any phase of a system's life cycle. International cooperative programs help to reduce weapons system acquisition costs through cooperative development, production, and support; and enhance interoperability with coalition partners. The United States has entered into cooperative programs with other nations for selected MDAPs. The largest international cooperative program is the Joint Strike Fighter (F-35), which has 11 international partners.
