By September 30, 2017, U.S. government partnerships with developing countries to refine and implement their low emission development strategies (LEDS) will result in achievement of 100 (from a baseline of 46) major&amp;nbsp; milestones which contribute to significant, measureable progress toward achieving domestic and international contributions to global greenhouse gas reductions.&amp;nbsp; At least 4,000 developing country government officials and practitioners (from a baseline of 2,000) will strengthen their LEDS capacity through participation in the LEDS Global Partnership (GP), and that capacity will result in strengthened LEDS policies or measures in 24&amp;nbsp;countries (from a baseline of 0).&amp;nbsp;
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>The focus of this Agency Priority Goal (APG) is to enable economic growth in developing countries in a manner that supports their long term transition to a low greenhouse gas emissions economy, thereby enhancing their ability to contribute to the global effort to address climate change. The U.S. Government (USG)&amp;nbsp;will accomplish this by supporting the development, refinement and implementation of country-driven low emission development strategies (LEDS) and international and domestic climate change mitigation commitments.

LEDS is both a development and a diplomatic priority. &amp;nbsp;The USG's&amp;nbsp;development agenda is supported by&amp;nbsp;work on LEDS, which promotes long-term, sustainable, low emission economic growth. The USG's&amp;nbsp;diplomatic agenda is supported by&amp;nbsp;LEDS, as it is the foundation for enabling&amp;nbsp;developing countries to better understand and prioritize their&amp;nbsp;options in order to determine which&amp;nbsp;development and mitigation goals they can achieve to&amp;nbsp;contribute to the international effort to address climate change. An effective global effort to reduce GHG emissions in turn benefits the U.S. by reducing climate related risks. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;

This APG focuses on measuring the progress of the Enhancing Capacity for Low Emission Development Strategies (EC-LEDS) program and the multilateral LEDS Global Partnership. Through EC-LEDS, a multiagency U.S. Government team is working with partner countries to advance effective country-driven, economy-wide LEDS that support national development and economic growth objectives by scaling up clean energy capacity;&amp;nbsp;increasing the area of land under improved management; and advancing other actions that significantly&amp;nbsp;reduce projected emissions&amp;nbsp;from a &quot;business as usual&quot; pathway and monitor progress. The LEDS Global Partnership is an international community of practice for enhancing coordination, information exchange, and cooperation among countries and international programs working to advance low emission, climate-resilient growth. The U.S. worked with other donor countries and technical leaders to launch this Partnership in 2011.

This APG will also aim to capture progress of complementary U.S.-supported climate change programs that contribute to LEDS objectives in developing countries, including the major outcomes of programs that seek to incorporate&amp;nbsp;climate change mitigation.&amp;nbsp;

Low-emission, climate-resilient economic growth is highlighted as a U.S. diplomatic and development priority in the President’s Climate Action Plan, the U.S. National Security Strategy, the President’s Development Policy, and the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review.&amp;nbsp; Promoting low emission, climate-resilient development is a central pillar of the President’s Global Climate Change Initiative and is at the core of USAID’s Climate Change and Development Strategy.&amp;nbsp;

</next_steps><progress_update>Overview

Through the President’s Climate Action Plan, the President’s Global Climate Change Initiative, and USAID’s Climate Change and Development Strategy, the United States has made low-emissions, climate-resilient sustainable economic growth a priority in our diplomacy and development. &amp;nbsp;The United States is leading efforts to address climate change through international climate negotiations while enhancing multilateral and bilateral engagement with major economies. &amp;nbsp;It is also enhancing partnerships with other key countries and regions.&amp;nbsp; The United States is building partnerships to reduce emissions of short-lived climate pollutants and from deforestation.&amp;nbsp; The United States is also building capacity for countries to undertake low emission development strategies and actions. This work includes assisting countries to increase their capacity for cross-sector planning and formulating sectoral policies for low-emissions economic growth.

In FY 2016 Q4, the United States Government (USG) team exceeded its targets for two quarterly indicators and met two quarterly milestones.

The USG team exceeded the following quarterly indicator targets:


	The number of developing country officials and practitioners with strengthened capacity through participation in the Low Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS) Global Partnership (GP) reached 2,736 in FY 2016 Q4, which is 1,736 more than the cumulative target of 1,000 developing country officials and practitioners with strengthened capacity.
	The number of LEDS policies or measures in developing countries that were strengthened as a result of USG assistance reached 10 in FY 2016 Q4, up from 8 in FY 2016 Q3. This is one more than the cumulative target of nine policies or measures strengthened.


The USG team met the following quarterly milestones for this reporting period:


	Through a new publication from the LEDS GP Transport Working Group, which summarizes the key messages from a webinar series on implementing new fuel quality and vehicle emission standards in Asia, the USG met the milestone to complete at least one case study or establish one technical toolkit on LEDS approaches.
	The milestone to have at least one private sector entity engage in the LEDS GP and provide technical advisory or financial services is complete by a partnership established with the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). &amp;nbsp;WBCSD provided resources and trainings on mini-grids to the LEDS GP community.


Explanation of Results

Number of developing country officials and practitioners with strengthened capacity

The indicator for the number of developing country officials and practitioners with strengthened capacity through participation in the LEDS GP exceeded its target as a result of well-attended technical assistance activities and workshops led by the LEDS GP Working Groups and Regional Platforms.

Breakdown:

A total of seven capacity strengthening web-based trainings were delivered to at least 404 developing country officials and practitioners. Web-based trainings delivered by the LEDS Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) Platform covered topics such as:


	Challenges and opportunities for business in a low-carbon economy;
	Development of youth leadership through LEDS;
	Tools for estimating greenhouse gas emissions in transport projects.


Additionally, the Energy Working Group delivered two web-based training sessions for the LAC Bioelectricity Community of Practice which covered topics including biomass resource potentials, technical considerations, and costs and benefits of bioelectricity development.

Another 420 developing country officials and practitioners strengthened LEDS capacity through in-person training delivered during the LEDS LAC Annual Event held in Panama City, Panama on September 24-26, 2016.&amp;nbsp; Additional capacity building took place through the new Asia Region Transport Community of Practices, which held a launch event on the sidelines of the Asia Development Bank Transport Forum held in Manila, Philippines on September 13, 2016. The LEDS LAC regional event engaged participants, from 21 developing country governments, in hands-on training sessions organized by LEDS LAC partner organizations. Topics covered during training sessions included:


	Financing nationally determined contributions (NDC) implementation;
	Private sector participation in the design and implementation of LEDS and NDCs;
	Technology transfer for LEDS;
	Linking REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) and LEDS strategies;
	Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) and its role in NDC implementation.


Participants had opportunities to share results of their projects with colleagues from across the region, to extend their network of contacts, and to identify opportunities for collaboration on challenges related to private sector finance mobilization, policy and regulatory mechanisms, and benefits assessment of LEDS.

&amp;nbsp;

The LEDS GP Transport Working Group, with support from the Asia LEDS Partnership (ALP), organized a roundtable discussion on September 13, 2016, at Pasig City, Philippines, to launch a community of practice to focus on capacity building for planning and implementation of low carbon transport actions.

This meeting identified transport priorities in Asia and explored opportunities for partnerships to address these priority areas especially on delivering capacity building support across Asia.

Number of LEDS policies or measures improved

Through technical assistance efforts in Chile and Macedonia the target for number of policies or measures strengthened as a result of USG assistance was met.

In Chile, the LEDS GP Benefits Working Group (WG) compiled a resource guide describing a MRV framework for the Clean Production National Council. This guide has strengthened the National Council’s framework to measure and report the impacts of the Clean Production Agreement – which is intended to support Chile's implementation of clean production through respective targets and verifiable actions within a specific time period. In addition to the guide, the Manager of Chile's Clean Production Agreements received training on qualitative and quantitative impact assessments of Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions at the LEDS LAC annual event held in Panama. After the training, he commented, &quot;the guide is useful for us because it gives us a general framework of the things we should be looking at when implementing Clean Production Agreements, not just for data collection, but for actions that could impact other MRV categories. It also gives us an idea of things of interest that we could calculate using the data we already have.”

The LEDS GP collaborated with Macedonia’s Deputy Prime Minister and the Cabinet of the Deputy Prime Minister through the Remote Expert Assistance on LEDS (REAL) service to strengthen the Government of Macedonia’s framework to develop a LEDS strategy and implement actions aligned with Macedonia’s national development priorities. Through a series of consultations with key stakeholders working on low emission development in the country, LEDS GP experts identified gaps and provided comprehensive recommendations on establishing targets, baselines, and mitigation scenarios, methods for including the private sector in policy development, enhancing government staff capacity and leadership, and linking national and subnational efforts.

Additionally, there are ongoing technical assistance efforts in Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) supporting additional actions not captured under this quarter’s results. In Cameroon, LEDS GP offered key scoping questions for LEDS to assess the national vision and agencies’ priorities and support a future LEDS inception mission. In the DRC, the LEDS GP&amp;nbsp;provided technical assistance to the DRC Government to incorporate LEDS related concepts, objectives and approaches into the national development plan to help the country to achieve its vision of emerging economy status by 2030. Although not counted toward indicator results in this quarter, the USG expects these efforts to result in strengthened LEDS policies and measures in the near future. Actions taken earlier this year strengthened eight LEDS policies or measures by harnessing capacity gained through participation in the LEDS Global Partnership.&amp;nbsp; These eight policies are detailed in earlier quarterly updates.&amp;nbsp;

Quarterly milestones

Through a new publication from the LEDS GP Transport Working Group, which summarizes the key messages from a webinar series on implementing new fuel quality and vehicle emission standards in Asia, the milestone to complete at least one case study or establish one technical toolkit on LEDS approaches was completed. This publication, ‘Clearing the air – Supporting Asian countries to implement new fuel quality and vehicle emission standards,’ adds to the global knowledge base on fuel quality and vehicle emission standards and provides examples of steps towards successful LEDS implementation in the transport sector.

The LEDS GP also published several technical reports and case studies in the previous reporting period that continued to be accessed and utilized during the current quarter, including:


	From the Benefits WG: Presenting the benefits of low emission development strategies
	From the Transport WG: Exploring the many benefits of low carbon urban transport
	From the Subnational Integration WG: Mobilizing a local green economy – GreenCape in the Western Cape, South Africa and Gujarat state: Pioneering and scaling up solar energy in India


Through a partnership established with the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) the milestone to have at least one private sector entity engage in the LEDS GP and provide technical advisory or financial services was met. The WBCSD is a CEO-led organization of forward-thinking companies that galvanizes the global business community to create a sustainable future for business, society and the environment. The Council provides a forum for its 200 member companies - who represent all business sectors, all continents and combined revenue of over $US 7 trillion - to share best practices on sustainable development issues and to develop innovative tools that change the status quo. The Council also amplifies its efforts through a network of 60 national and regional business councils and partner organizations, a majority of which are based in developing countries.

Challenges and Opportunities

The U.S. Government team continued to improve the monitoring and reporting system to better track the impact of the LEDS GP activities across working groups and regional platforms. Based on feedback from the previous round of reporting in FY 2016 Q3, the monitoring and evaluation team redesigned the reporting system to better align with requirements across a variety of donors. The variety of different reporting metrics across donor agencies continues to be a challenge for tracking progress efficiently.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Climate change is a real and imminent threat to core U.S. interests and to the global economy.  The scientific consensus is that greenhouse gases are causing higher land temperatures, warming oceans, raising average sea levels, and creating more extreme heat waves and storms.  These changes are leading to declines in agricultural productivity, exacerbating water scarcity, causing losses of biodiversity, and amplifying humanitarian crises that risk undermining the social, economic, and political stability of our allies and partners.  Climate change disproportionately affects the most vulnerable, threatens to reverse hard-won development gains, and works against U.S. interests worldwide – namely peace and stability, poverty alleviation, food security, and economic development.  It is in America’s vital interest to lead in the global fight against climate change by taking aggressive, smart, and effective action. 
Sustainable and secure sources of energy are fundamental to global economic growth, prosperity, and stability.  Global energy demand is expected to increase nearly 40 percent by 2030, with more than 90 percent of that increase occurring in developing and emerging market countries.  Without effective action, this increasing demand will lead to greater emissions causing further climate change.
Under the President’s Climate Action Plan, we are investing at home to cut emissions from power plants, unlocking long-term investment in clean energy innovation, and building resilience to climate change in our communities.  Internationally, we are leading efforts to forge a new agreement that applies to all countries starting in 2020.  We are encouraging the safe, responsible transition to cleaner fuels such as natural gas, fostering investment, encouraging innovation in renewable technologies, and thereby creating opportunities for U.S. businesses.  We are supporting countries in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from their forests and their land.  And we are using diplomatic tools and development resources to reduce the likelihood of even more dangerous climate change in the future and to prepare vulnerable nations for climate impacts that will be unavoidable. 
For the State Department and USAID, promoting the transition to a low-emission, climate-resilient world while expanding global access to sustainable energy is central to our mission.  We are committed to addressing climate change in a way that permits all countries to prosper.  We understand that this requires a fundamental shift in the way the world uses land and produces, consumes, and distributes energy, while maintaining economic growth.  We are also working to encourage responsible resource management by promoting global transparency standards to ensure energy producing countries are well-governed. 
Energy and climate change shape political, economic, environmental, and security developments within and among countries.  The global energy sector is undergoing dramatic change.  Technologies such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling are altering the global energy landscape, with the Western Hemisphere becoming increasingly important as a source of production.  Renewable energy costs have plummeted in recent years.  Due to burgeoning domestic production of unconventional gas and oil, the United States will become a net exporter of natural gas.  Our oil imports are at their lowest level in 20 years.  Energy efficiency and conservation programs with strong bipartisan support, such as improvements in vehicle fuel efficiency, continue to reduce our petroleum demand.
Even as the United States reduces its reliance on imported oil and gas and encourages a transition to renewable energy, increased energy demand from emerging markets continues to drive global demand for hydrocarbons.  As we seek to transition from traditional energy resources, the world still needs a stable supply of energy, including security to the lines of transportation and a reasonable price for oil and gas.  This security underpins stability in the global economy and helps mitigate resource-driven security risks.
</strategic_goal_overview><strategic_goal_sequence>3</strategic_goal_sequence></Strategic_Goal></Strategic_Goals><Strategic_Objectives><Strategic_Objective><id>2109</id><objective_header>Building on Strong Domestic Action, Lead International Actions to Combat Climate Change</objective_header><objective_statement></objective_statement><objective_overview>Addressing climate change successfully demands action at home and more intensive engagement with other countries.  Domestically, by 2020, the United States plans to meet its commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions in the range of 17 percent below 2005 levels.
Internationally, as a result of recent progress in negotiations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the international climate regime now reflects pledges through 2020 by more than 80 countries constituting about 80 percent of global emissions, including the world’s major emitters, and holds countries accountable for their actions through regular and robust reporting and reviews.  In December 2015, the 195 countries party to the UNFCCC are to conclude a new agreement addressing the global climate response in the post-2020 era.  This will be a major milestone in the effort to combat climate change over the next two decades.  Simultaneously, we will enhance engagement bilaterally, plurilaterally, and multilaterally to deliver results that will contribute to an ambitious and effective global response to climate change, through 2020 and beyond.
External factors that could affect our efforts include negotiating stances of other countries and domestic actions some countries take to combat climate change.  The private sector plays a major role, as investment decisions such as the choice of technologies for new power generation and design of new cars and trucks can have a climate impact for years to come.  Also, partnering with countries to encourage a low-emissions development path will be more successful when working with foreign governments that make combating climate change a priority.
Strategies for Achieving the Objective
Through the President’s Climate Action Plan, the President’s Global Climate Change Initiative, and USAID’s Climate Change and Development Strategy, the United States has made low-emissions, climate-resilient sustainable economic growth a priority in our diplomacy and development.  Our efforts involve two major areas of engagement:  (1) lowering the atmospheric accumulation rate of greenhouse gases that cause climate change; and (2) helping societies anticipate and incorporate plans for responding to potential climate change impacts.  The United States is leading efforts to address climate change through international climate negotiations while enhancing multilateral and bilateral engagement with major economies.  It is also enhancing partnerships with other key countries and regions.  The U.S. is focusing its efforts on actions that support a successful global approach to climate change, as reflected in discussions leading up to the Paris climate conference in 2015, and for subsequent United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) sessions.  These efforts deliver results that contribute to an ambitious and effective global response to climate change to the year 2020 and beyond.
The U.S. is building partnerships to reduce emissions of short-lived climate pollutants and from deforestation.  For example, the U.S. works to secure a global phase-down of hydro-fluoro-carbons through the Montreal Protocol.  If implemented, this could reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by 90 gigatons of CO2 equivalent by 2050.  The U.S. is also building capacity for countries to undertake low-emission development policies.  This work includes assisting countries to increase their capacity for cross-sector planning and formulating sectoral policies for low-emissions growth.  Other efforts aim to expand clean energy generation and transmission and to increase energy efficiency while phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption.  This requires mobilizing public and private investments in cleaner energy, implementing enhanced land-use practices, and building public-private partnerships that reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation.
The Department of State and USAID’s climate-smart agriculture efforts involve implementing technologies that increase climate resilience and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  State and USAID are also working to promote sustainable land uses, which combine climate change mitigation and resilience with long-term growth.  Additionally, State and USAID support adaptation planning processes in vulnerable countries and communities by developing support tools that use climate science and improve access to data.  These integrate climate data into planning decisions. They also strengthen public participation in climate change planning, especially by women, vulnerable populations, indigenous groups, and minorities.  State and USAID back actions that increase climate resilience with respect to water security, land management, disaster planning, financial risk management, and management of biodiversity and natural resources.
The United States supports bilateral and multilateral programs by working with the most vulnerable communities, least developed and developing nations, and the major greenhouse gas emitters.  Among the programs and efforts to achieve their overall climate change objectives, State and USAID have chosen to highlight efforts to support Low Emission Development Strategies (LEDS) as a cross-cutting Agency Priority Goal.  Through LEDS assistance, State and USAID seek to guide policy-makers in analyzing, formulating, and making policy decisions enabling them to develop along a lower emission pathway, which contributes to greenhouse gas reduction efforts.  The main program for providing LEDS Assistance, the Enhancing Capacity for LEDS (EC-LEDS) program is a unique State and USAID partnership that blends their respective strengths in diplomacy and development.  EC-LEDS stands as a key element of U.S. climate assistance, alongside their critical efforts including:  (1) the Major Economies Forum; (2) Clean Energy Ministerial; (3) Climate and Clean Air Coalition; (4) Tropical Forest Alliance (TFA)2020; and (5) a range of multilateral funds, such as the Clean Investment Funds and funds focusing on adaptation such as the Least Developed Countries Fund and the Special Climate Change Fund.
