&amp;nbsp;


[1] “New competitive grant dollars that reward evidence” includes all dollars awarded based on the existence of at least “evidence of promise” in support of a project, per the framework in the Education Department General Administrative Regulations (34 CFR Part 75). Consideration of such evidence appears through: eligibility threshold (e.g., in the Investing in Innovation program); absolute priority; competitive priority (earning at least one point for it); or selection criteria (earning at least one point for it). The percentage is calculated compared to the total new grant dollars awarded.


</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>GOAL OVERVIEW

Through its mix of grants, contracts, and internal analytic work, the Department of Education (ED) will support the use of research methods and rigorous study designs that provide evidence that is as robust as possible and fit for the purpose. This goal will track whether ED is increasing its internal capacity to make competitive grant awards based on the existence of (and amount of) evidence in support of projects, where appropriate.

&amp;nbsp;

KEY BARRIERS AND CHALLENGES

The process to collect data and track progress against the goal is still under development, and using evidence to award competitive grants entails a shift in culture and capacity building across ED to do it well. Additionally, goal targets are based on reasonable projections about which competitive grant programs may make new awards in this fiscal year, but the actual dollar amount awarded will depend on final appropriations amounts and other funding decisions and trade-offs. Grantees vary in their comfort with and understanding of evaluation and use of evidence, yet ED has limited resources to support grantees in conducting rigorous evaluations that would produce evidence of effectiveness.

&amp;nbsp;

EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS

There is an increasing emphasis among stakeholders on the importance of using evidence to support government program funding decisions, and ED regularly engages the field on this topic. A number of outside organizations have convened experts to discuss how to encourage such decisions. In addition, philanthropic and congressional actors prioritized using evidence to support decision-making and have encouraged the field to do the same. Finally, ED has worked with the National Science Foundation to develop a common evidence framework around which to organize research investments and grants. Indeed, ED is considered a leader on the issue among federal agencies, and external groups are eager for ED to deepen and broaden its efforts.

	Progress toward goal: The Department of Education (ED) surpassed the goal of increasing the percentage of select new (non-continuation) discretionary grant dollars that reward evidence to nine percent.&amp;nbsp; In Fiscal Year (FY) 2014, 15.92 percent of ED’s discretionary dollars was awarded to new projects with supporting evidence of effectiveness.&amp;nbsp; Data for FY15 will not be available until Quarter 1 of FY16, but the Department thinks, based on internal projections and on past performance, that it will again meet its target.
	The strategic objective to which this agency priority goal contributes aims to improve the use of research.&amp;nbsp; As such, in addition to the APG metrics, ED includes metrics specific to the Education Resource Information Center (ERIC) and the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC). As of Q4, the number of full-text of peer-reviewed education research resources reached 36,197 and the number of reviewed studies in the WWC reached 10,889.&amp;nbsp; As of Q3, we have already surpassed our FY15 target for both metrics.
	ED’s Evidence Planning Group (EPG) continues to identify opportunities for discretionary grant programs to use evidence-related priorities or selection criteria in competitions.&amp;nbsp; In FY15, five competitions in the Office of Innovation and Improvement (OII), the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (OESE), and the Office of Postsecondary Education (OPE) are planning to use evidence in competitions through a mix of eligibility requirements, absolute or competitive preference priorities, and selection criteria.&amp;nbsp; In addition, EPG continues to meet with each grant making office in ED to discuss appropriate uses of evidence in FY16 competitions. In Q4, the following discretionary grant programs rewarded evidence in their FY15 competitions:
	
		Supporting Effective Educator Development
		First in the World
		TRIO -- Student Support Services
		Strengthening Institutions Program
	
	
	In addition, in Q1 of FY16, the Investing in Innovation (i3) program will reward evidence.
	In FY15, ED moved toward a new standardized process for collecting input data relevant to this APG.&amp;nbsp; EPG collected relevant data on each contributing throughout the year, and followed up with those programs early in FY16 to confirm that the amounts awarded to evidence-based projects was accurate.&amp;nbsp; EPG continues to engage internal stakeholders to critically assess validation and verification processes.
	As of the end of FY15, ED surpassed this APG.&amp;nbsp; However, the work is far from over.&amp;nbsp; We note that EPG continues to meet with program offices in ED to discuss each program’s strategy for incorporating use of evidence in their work, and how EPG can be supportive in that process.&amp;nbsp; ED has proposed an updated version of this APG for FY16-17, signaling its continued commitment to this work.&amp;nbsp;

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Achieving the president’s 2020 college attainment goal will require better and stronger systems, powered by reliable and usable information that informs decision making, as well as by innovation.  Through this strategic plan, the Department aims to foster a culture of continuous systems improvement at the national, state, and local levels.  To achieve this goal, the Department will support robust and comprehensive data systems that produce timely, relevant, and understandable information while properly protecting student privacy; strategic use of research, evaluation, and  evidence in decision making at all levels; increased innovation; and effective and systemic use of technology.
 
The foundation for improving systemic capacity is an infrastructure that supports data-driven decision making.  Stakeholders must have access to relevant, useful data in a timely fashion, and the skills to better understand and make use of the data.  With relevant and actionable data and the ability to use it, policymakers and educators will be able to appraise how states, districts, schools, and students are currently performing; measure progress; pinpoint gaps; improve practice; better address student needs; and make sound decisions.  States are developing systems that will yield the valid, reliable data that are essential to achieving these purposes, but there is much more work to do.  The Department will continue helping states develop effective statewide longitudinal data systems, design voluntary common data standards to increase interoperability, and develop the capacity of institutions and staff to utilize data to improve teaching and learning.  These activities will help to generate an accurate picture of student performance and other critical elements, from early learning programs through postsecondary institutions and the workforce. At the same time, the Department will work through the government-wide Open Data Initiative to ensure that its own information and data are accessible to and useable by researchers, analysts, and developers in the general public.
 
Of course, the collection and use of data must be responsible and must appropriately protect student privacy.  Stewards and users of data must remember that data describe real people and ensure that systems protect the rights of those people. But there is no need to sacrifice data-driven decision making to protect student privacy, and the Department will help practitioners in the field ensure they are properly protecting privacy, and communicating with parents and students about the proper use and management of student data.
Systemic improvement also requires research and evaluation so that decision makers at the national, state, and local levels have reliable evidence to inform their actions. The Department aims to support research that will make a difference by giving states, districts, and schools the information and evidence they need to identify the effective practices they need to adopt. This research will also help them focus scarce resources on investments most likely to have the greatest impact and become more dynamic learning organizations.  In service of this, the Department will use its programmatic and research activities to incentivize the creation and use of evidence by stakeholders in the field. In addition, the Department will use evidence to inform its own policymaking and program development, and will work to communicate the findings of its research and evaluation activities to the field in an engaging and relevant way, further increasing their impact.
The goals and actions in this strategic plan sharpen the focus on the need to generate bold and creative solutions, and aim to support innovation in partnership with other federal partners and private organizations with related missions.  The Department will continue to stimulate innovations in education and provide funds needed to accelerate their design and adoption.  It also will work with Congress to fill a gap in the research and development landscape by establishing an advanced research projects agency for education to pursue breakthrough developments in ways not possible using existing Department mechanisms.
 
The Department’s vision for 21st-century learning also requires that schools have a 21st -century technology infrastructure, anchored around high-speed Internet. States, districts, and schools must have such infrastructure to incorporate cutting-edge methods for strengthening curriculum quality and delivery to meet more rigorous college- and career-ready standards; improving student access and engagement; developing comprehensive, formative, and summative assessment systems; and enhancing data management systems.
How will we measure success?  
 
The Department will use the following indicators to measure its success in enhancing the U.S. education system’s ability to continuously improve through better and more widespread use of data, research and evaluation, evidence, transparency, innovation, and technology.
 
 
Continuous Improvement of the U.S. Education System’s Indicators of Success

What could hold us back?  What’s beyond our control?  (External Risk Factors)
 
Efforts to ensure that robust, integrated data systems are linked with early childhood, postsecondary, and workforce-level data will be constrained by the amount of time, financial resources, and support available to states to carry out this work.  State and local funding for data systems may be reduced due to continued budgetary pressures at all levels.  Moreover, wide variations in the various data systems present unique challenges for each state.  Some district data systems, for example, far surpass their own state’s data system.  Efforts to ensure that data systems lead to data-driven decision making may also encounter obstacles around privacy concerns that will need to be addressed.
 
The implementation of these strategies depends on the availability of resources for evaluation and research, which are typically more difficult to obtain than resources for services and program implementation.  In addition, many of the activities supporting this goal will be carried out by contractors and grantees, and thus are, in part, dependent on the capacity and quality of research expertise that exists outside the Department.  This variance in capacity may be more pronounced when it comes to interpreting and using evidence to drive decision making. Similarly, the evidence base regarding interventions in some areas is more robust than in others. And some grant programs focus on areas with less-developed evidence bases. At least in the short term, this could affect the amount of Department funding tied to the existence of certain levels of evidence for projects. Additionally, there are the perceived and real challenges states and districts face in implementing programs in ways that can support the strongest possible studies and evaluations of those programs. Some of these challenges can be addressed through Departmental technical assistance, but others may arise.
 
As reflected by Strategic Objective 5.2, one ongoing challenge is to protect privacy while increasing accessibility to relevant information. For its part, the Department will continue to vigilantly safeguard all personally identifiable information while also helping education agencies make useful information available. The Department also will help stakeholders develop best practices in protecting privacy while still driving data-driven decision making. But no system is perfect, and concerns about privacy may deter stakeholders from embracing the use of data, regardless of the actual level of risk presented.  Another risk lies in finding the right balance of information as too much information could make it nearly impossible to find meaning within data. To avoid this problem, the Department must work with stakeholders to prioritize information and to determine what is most likely to help families make choices for their children, help teachers improve student learning, and enable decision makers to improve education institutions.
 
Education funding faces tremendous budgetary pressure across the country, putting investment in new programs, strategies, or processes at risk.  In this time of decreasing budgets, technology infrastructure and other innovations might be seen as luxuries rather than as mission critical.  Because the private sector currently does not find investment in education innovation as attractive as investment in innovation in other sectors, there is limited private funding to help bridge the gaps.  And the promise of technology might be affected by variance in the capacity of states, districts, and schools to plan, implement, and support modern technology networks.
