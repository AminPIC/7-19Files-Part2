Fulfilling our country’s commitment to Veterans, VA will deliver effective and easy customer experiences in which Veterans feel valued.

By September 30, 2017, reach 90% agreement with the statement “I trust VA to fulfill our country’s commitment to Veterans.”

Because this is a new measure, VA will establish the baseline in FY16 and add the measure to surveys covering all of VA’s primary services and product lines.
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>VA offers a remarkable array of services and benefits to Veterans and eligible dependents. But the experience is disjointed and inconsistent. There are hundreds of phone numbers and thousands of websites, each operating independently under different standards. Similarly, there are a wide array of VA and non-VA resources at the Federal, state, local, corporate, non-profit and tribal level that are not coherently organized or coordinated into a single source or reference point for the Veteran. &amp;nbsp;Veterans deserve better and so do VA staff, who care deeply about delivering the best possible outcome for Veterans.

The Veterans Experience team is leading a powerful new effort to improve customer experiences across VA, nationwide. Our goal: Fostering the delivery of effective and easy customer experiences in which Veterans feel valued. We are achieving this goal the same way the world’s most successful companies do: by listening to our customers – Veterans, their families and supporters – when they describe how they want things to work. Equally important, we are listening to our employees about obstacles to excellence on-the-job. Employee empowerment is an essential part of the equation. This is user-centered design. It puts Veterans and the employees who serve them front and center.

VA and the Veterans Experience team face a number of challenges and barriers:


	Siloed products and services without a common view of customers and their needs and wants.
	Customer touchpoints and experiences owned by individual product and service teams, not integrated within a complementary suite of offerings.
	Insular approach that does not account for the community resources used by customers.


The APG will track our ability to overcome these barriers by implementing the strategies described in the next section.

To build trust among our customers, VA must consistently deliver customer experiences marked by effectiveness, ease, and engagement.[1]&amp;nbsp;To ensure comparability across VA’s disparate service and product lines, the same measures of Trust and Customer Experience will be applied.

Trust

VA earns trust among Veterans by knowing them and showing that we care; by understanding and anticipating their needs; by providing fair benefits and timely services; by being there when they need us; and by keeping our promises. With every interaction, VA has the opportunity to deepen a trusting relationship with Veterans, or to diminish that trust.

Our Agency Priority Goal states: By September 30, 2017, VA will reach 90% agreement with the statement “I trust VA to fulfill our country’s commitment to Veterans.”

Timeline:

Q1 FY16:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Trust and Experience measures incorporated into existing customer experience surveys

Q2 FY16:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Baseline data collection begins

Q3 FY16:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Baseline measurement established; quarterly targets specified

Q4 FY 2016:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Publish quarterly update

Q1 FY 2017:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 70 percent of VA customers surveyed ‘agree’ or ‘strongly agree’ with Trust&amp;nbsp; statement Customer Experience

Q2 FY 2017:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;75 percent of VA customers surveyed ‘agree’ or ‘strongly agree’ with Trust statement Customer Experience

Q3 FY 2017:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;80 percent of VA customers surveyed ‘agree’ or ‘strongly agree’ with Trust statement Customer Experience

Q4 FY17:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 90% of VA customers surveyed ‘agree’ or ‘strongly agree’ with Trust statement

Customer Experience

Trust in VA is built one interaction at a time. The experience must be effective; it must be easy; and, ideally, it must be engaging and reflective of a valued, personal relationship with our customer. Trust is broken when VA does not consistently meet expectations in these three categories. VA will use customers’ ratings of their individual experiences as indicators of performance toward the overall Veterans Experience APG.

The measures will include level of agreement with questions such as:


	Effectiveness: “I got the service I needed.”
	Ease: “It was easy to get the service I needed.”
	Engagement: “I felt like a valued customer.”


These measures are also new, and will be implemented along the timeline for the Trust measure indicated above. They will be added to new and existing VA customer experience surveys where responses will be correlated with operational data to highlight performance improvement opportunities that will improve Veterans experiences.

VA is on target to meet its Q1 FY 2017&amp;nbsp; goal for reporting VE APG measures for the period July-September 2016.

MyVA Communities:
VE will further improve the Veterans Experience by actively engaging in MyVA Communities and the community Veterans engagement boards (CVEBs). VE support will be ongoing and the local District VE teams will be engaged in planning, implementing, and monitoring local community efforts in all quarters throughout FY 2017.&amp;nbsp; The role of the teams&amp;nbsp; in local communities is to be the conduit to building trusted relationships between VA and local stakeholders, create a CVEB network across the districts (district-level summits), and share best practices, knowledge, and lessons learned with other CVEBs.&amp;nbsp; The teams will also spark interest in other communities without a coordinated support system of resources, compare/correlate Veteran data with CVEB activities, and provide support and customizable tools to the CVEBs and local VA facility leaders who participate with the boards.&amp;nbsp; The team will continue to work towards establishing 100 MyVA communities by December 31, 2016.
</next_steps><progress_update>During the fourth quarter 2016, the Office of Veterans Experience (VE) continued to make progress in multiple areas – performance measurement, MyVA Communities, Vets.gov, the VA Contact Centers, and the District Veterans Experience Offices.


Performance Measurement:

VA met its fourth quarter goal by collecting survey data from customers who used VA services between April 2016 – June 2016. The Q4 VE survey questions were:
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; o “I trust VA to fulfill our country’s commitment with Veterans,”
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; o “I got the care or service I needed,”
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; o “It was easy to get the care or service I needed,” and
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; o “I felt like a valued customer.”

We also asked customers an open-ended question on how VA can improve their experience. Customer responses to this survey indicate that trust in VA increased to 59 percent.&amp;nbsp; This direct customer feedback now allows VA to understand the Veterans’ experience as a necessary step to prioritizing experience improvements.

MyVA Communities:
VE is still on track to reaching the next milestone of 100 MyVA Communities by December 31, 2016.&amp;nbsp; In addition, we successfully met our goal of establishing a network of MyVA communities through our first E-summit which occurred on September 9, 2016.&amp;nbsp; This summit included 1,026 registered viewers, addressed over 100 stakeholder questions, and received 34 social media impressions about the event.

Vets.gov:
In Q4 the VETs.gov team was able to complete two critical milestones:
•&amp;nbsp;Completed the vets.gov account proof of concept
•&amp;nbsp;Migrated 50 percent of content and services to vets.gov

Background: Vets.gov will be the single VA website where Veterans will go to discover, apply for, track, and manage the VA benefits and services they have earned.&amp;nbsp; The initial beta release of Vets.gov was successfully launched on Veterans Day, November 11, 2015 in the Amazon cloud and has a full-VA Authority to Operate.&amp;nbsp; This is a first step toward the end-state vision.&amp;nbsp; The Vets.gov team is “developing in the open” to ensure that Veteran feedback drives the design, feature development, and rollout of Vets.gov. Veteran research sessions are conducted every week with Veterans, and the Vets.gov team is constantly updating the design and adding functionality to the site.&amp;nbsp; Moreover, Vets.gov is not just a website; rather it is a cloud-based platform that enables VA to deliver the highest performing, integrated services more quickly and cost effectively.&amp;nbsp; Vets.gov has already delivered immediate benefits to Veterans and their families, including:

•&amp;nbsp;Online health care application for Veterans to apply for VA health care; approximately 500 Veterans now apply for health care online daily (compared to 62 per day previously), totaling 67,259 online applications submitted since July 2016
•&amp;nbsp;GI Bill® Comparison Tool: Veterans can use VA’s GI Bill® Comparison Tool to make the most of their GI Bill Benefits
•&amp;nbsp;Facility Locator: Find VA facilities throughout the U.S. and its territories.
•&amp;nbsp;Veterans Employment Center: Connects Veterans and their families with meaningful employment and career development opportunities.
•&amp;nbsp;Mobile-responsive
•&amp;nbsp;100 percent 508 compliant
•&amp;nbsp;More than 250 content pages for disability and education benefits have been rewritten in Plain Language
•&amp;nbsp;User feedback mechanism on Vets.gov “feedback forum”

531 Veteran facing, VA.gov websites have been reviewed and analyzed for migration.

70 percent of in-scope websites have been migrated, or are currently in process of being migrated.

Customer Data Integration (Veteran 360):
While Vets.gov is a Veteran’s&amp;nbsp; “single view of VA,”,&amp;nbsp; customer data management (formerly CDI) is the ”single view of the Veteran.”&amp;nbsp; Customer data management will improve Veterans’ experience by providing a single, authoritative view of the Veterans information, information they provide to VA, and their information within VA.&amp;nbsp; Examples of customer data management will improve Veterans digital experience, including that a Veteran will be able to easily associate their verified military status to activities such as their Linkedin profile.

Call Center:
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Technology modernization efforts are on target
o&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Completed design of call flows and scripts for the enterprise and downstream IVR systems.
o&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Completed development of the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems and testing is in progress.
o&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; MyVA311 Knowledge Management content is under development.

District Veterans Experience Offices:
VA’s VE has hired four&amp;nbsp;of the five District Veterans Experience Officers (DVEOs).&amp;nbsp; Final selections on the remaining two DVEO positions are underway.&amp;nbsp; The five District Offices designed to support DVEOs are in the process of staffing and standing up field operations.&amp;nbsp; Both the North Atlantic and the South East Districts are fully staffed.&amp;nbsp; The remaining three Districts are actively recruiting and are currently staffed at approximately 50 percent.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; District staff across the country have already begun to work with local facilities in effort to improve the Veteran Experience and increase Veteran trust.

</strategic_goal_statement><strategic_goal_overview>Military service provides Servicemembers with tremendous skills, experience, and honor, but may also result in equally significant sacrifices and challenges. VA will work to ensure Veterans are empowered, independent, self-sustaining, and well equipped for civilian life.
Each Veteran is unique, yet shaped by: their generation; the conditions of their military service, including any war or conflict in which they served; their gender; their ethnicity; and their support system of faith, family, friends, and caregivers. Each has different needs and expectations, which may change many times between the time they take their induction oath and when the last benefit is received by their survivors.
VA will both directly, and in collaboration with its partners, deliver benefits and services in an integrated, client-centered portfolio that is personalized to meet each Veteran’s needs and situation. Success will be measured in terms relevant to individual Veteran outcomes from VA benefits and services.

</objective_statement><objective_overview>Summary:
VA is a customer service organization. Complicated application processes, long processing timelines or difficulties getting information and appointments all impact the client’s experience and satisfaction. Veterans and eligible beneficiaries deserve a support system that is responsive to their needs. VA must keep pace with Veterans’ expectations and transform its customer services – soliciting regular customer feedback, streamlining processes, and delivering consistent service across customer-preferred channels.
We live in a connected world. The rapid pace of technological advancement is reshaping Veterans’ expectations regarding how services, benefits, and support should be delivered. Today’s client expects instant access to information and self-service options via the Internet, and increasingly through mobile devices like tablets and smartphones (and the next generation “smart” devices that are yet to be deployed).
To provide a personalized experience, we must listen, learn, and understand the needs and expectations of those we serve. We must have the knowledge, information and insight to understand why some choose not to fully engage with VA.
Strategies:
VA will provide timely, accurate decisions on Veterans’ disability claims and eliminate the claims backlog. We will then implement a robust plan, and revisit procedures to ensure claims are addressed in no more than 125 days with at least 98 percent accuracy. The plan includes redesigning policies and procedures, continuing to enhance training for claims processors, and utilizing the most advanced IT. We will also increase the use of video teleconference hearings to address claims appeals.
VA will continue to expand implementation of PACT to improve partnerships with Veterans and eligible beneficiaries, increase team-based care coordination and management, and expand access to care. VA will improve patient-facing and clinician-facing e-health systems by expanding the development and use of health-related virtual modalities. These modalities include telehealth[1], E-Consult[2], secure messaging, MyHealtheVet, and mobile applications.
VA will enhance client satisfaction by capturing client data once, sharing it enterprise-wide, and using this client data for a lifetime, which will promote more efficient use of data across business lines. We will identify sources of consistent, reliable, and authoritative Veteran data. We will establish architecture, business rules, roles and responsibilities, and governance to enable VA lines of business to use the authoritative common client data to improve delivery of benefits and services to Veterans. VA will gain access to additional external data, knowledge, and experiences so we can broaden our understanding of our client’s needs and expectations. We will enable secure, privacy-protected electronic exchange of personal, health, and economic data on Veterans from induction oath through the final survivor benefit.
VA will rethink its operations as a Department, defining the fundamental crosscutting capabilities and interdependencies required to perform them. We will identify and address any internal organizational, policy, procedural, perceptual, and cultural boundaries that constrain our ability to coordinate, integrate, and deliver benefits and services.
VA will streamline its virtual presence (Web sites, portals and call centers), reducing duplication and enhancing personalization to enable clients to get the information they need, on their schedule.
VA will increase access to burial benefits in national cemeteries through its plans to construct five new national cemeteries and by recognizing and addressing the unique needs of Veterans and eligible beneficiaries who reside in densely populated urban areas as well as sparsely populated rural locations. We will ensure that the service and appearance of our national cemeteries meets the highest standards commensurate with these national shrines.
 
[1] Telehealth uses information and telecommunication technologies to provide health care services in situations in which the patient and practitioner are separated by geographical distance. Telehealth in VA increases access to high quality health care services using Clinical Video Telehealth (CVT), Home Telehealth (HT) and Store and Forward Telehealth (SFT).
[2] E-Consult is an approach to provide clinical support from provider to provider.  Through a formal consult request, processed and documented in the Computerized Patient Record System, a provider requests a specialist to address a clinical problem or to answer a clinical question for a specific patient.  Utilizing information provided in the consult request and/or review of the patient’s electronic medical record, the consultant provides a documented response that addresses the request without a face-to-face visit.
