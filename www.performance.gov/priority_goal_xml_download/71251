By September 30, 2017, increase the number of new investigations by 2 percent with emphasis on holding individuals accountable associated with fraud and public corruption, including white collar crime, financial fraud, and health care fraud.
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>The term white collar crime is synonymous with a full range of frauds committed by business and government professionals. It is not a victimless crime. A single scam can destroy a company, devastate families by wiping out their life savings, or cost society billions of dollars (or even all three). Today’s fraud schemes are more sophisticated than ever. The financial crisis of 2008, impacting every American, resulted in fraud and deception in the finance and housing markets, as well as fraudulent schemes that misused the public’s unprecedented investment in economic recovery. The distressed condition of the national housing market, paired with high unemployment, created a fertile environment for unscrupulous fraudsters seeking to take advantage of desperate homeowners. Criminals who commit mortgage fraud, securities and commodities fraud, and other types of fraud victimize the American public as a whole. Similarly, those who defraud Medicare, Medicaid, and other government health care programs defraud every American. Fraudsters take critical resources out of our health care system—thus contributing to the rising cost of health care for all Americans and endangering the short-term and long-term solvency of these essential health care programs. The Department will address these critical problems by vigorously investigating and prosecuting white collar crimes, including financial fraud and health care fraud, in order to protect American businesses, consumers, and taxpayers. Fraud and public corruption, as reported by this Priority Goal, include a number of criminal and civil reporting categories including but not limited to: financial crime and corruption; public and corporate fraud, including health care fraud and mortgage fraud; public corruption; computer/cybercrime; identity theft; intellectual property crimes; and procurement fraud. Public corruption is a breach of trust by federal, state, or local officials—often with the help of private sector accomplices. Public corruption misdirects public monies, distorts governmental decision-making and threatens our democratic processes. Corrupt public officials undermine our country’s national security, our overall safety, the public trust, and confidence in the U.S. government, wasting billions of dollars. This corruption can tarnish virtually every aspect of society. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), passed in 1977, makes it illegal for U.S. companies, U.S. persons, and foreign corporations with certain U.S. ties to bribe foreign officials to obtain or retain business overseas. Foreign bribery can impact U.S. financial markets, economic growth, and national security. It also breaks down the international free market system by promoting anti-competitive behavior and, ultimately, makes consumers pay more. The Department will pursue criminal and civil litigation to protect the federal fisc and hold accountable corrupt officials and those who commit fraud; and promote transparency in markets by preserving competition and protecting consumers and investors.

Milestone: By 2017, fully implement a training program which directly addresses the Attorney General’s (AG) Individual Accountability Initiative.&amp;nbsp;

• Offer web-training - Healthcare Fraud Coordinator Course

• In person training sessions to experienced AUSAs on the Initiative and prosecuting individuals within a corporation.

• OLVP is planning a public corruption webinar that will be broadcast to the USAO community and Department’s Criminal Division on July 20, 2016.

CIV:

Milestone 1: Leverage the improved quality and quantity of data available to investigators and analysts. By FY 2017, the Civil Division will dedicate a team of Consumer Protection Board (CPB) investigators and analysts to enhance new and ongoing financial and consumer fraud investigations. CPB is adding 6 investigators and analysts to enhance new and ongoing financial and consumer fraud investigations. CPB hopes to have these positions on-board by the end of FY 2016.&amp;nbsp;

• One investigator was hired in 2nd quarter and has been brought onboard. No new hires have been made in 3rd quarter.

Milestone&amp;nbsp;2: Advise key stakeholders on the best practices associated with bringing fraud cases under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (“FIRREA”) and the False Claims Act (“FCA”). DOJ attorneys with expert knowledge of FIRREA and FCA will hold 2 national training conferences by FY 2017, with an audience that would include Civil Division attorneys, Assistant U.S. Attorneys, other DOJ attorneys, federal agency investigators, as well as state and local partners. This milestone will be reported in FY 2017.&amp;nbsp;

Milestone 3: Create an environment that encourages whistleblowers to uncover and report financial and health care fraud by participating in speaking engagements, trainings, and national conferences with internal and external audiences. This milestone will be&amp;nbsp;reported&amp;nbsp;in FY 2017.
</next_steps><progress_update>Annual Performance Measure: By September 30, 2017, increase the number of new investigations by 2 percent with emphasis on holding individuals accountable associated with fraud and public corruption, including white collar crime, financial fraud, and health care fraud.

For FY 2016, the Department handled 11,395 investigations comprised of 10,324 fraud investigations and 1,071 public corruption investigations. The Department was not able to meet the annual target of 12,844. Fraud and public corruption cases are some of the most complex cases that the United States USAOs handle. The majority of these cases are data intensive, requiring the collection, organization, and analysis of massive amounts of electronically stored information. Substantial resources must be allocated to reviewing and analyzing such data in existing investigations, which can reduce resources available to new investigations. Moreover, the time required to pursue our already high number of pending matters – from investigation through sentencing and appeal – is significantly longer than in other cases due to the complex nature of the crimes. In FY 2016, the Department continued to vigorously investigate and prosecute crimes related to fraud and public corruption. For example, in June 2016, a federal jury found Congressman Chaka Fatah Sr. (PA) guilty of all charges stemming from a racketeering conspiracy involving several schemes that were intended to further his and his co-conspirators’ political and financial interests by misappropriating federal, charitable and campaign funds, among other schemes. The evidence at trial showed that, among other things, Fattah and certain associates borrowed $1 million from a wealthy supporter for his failed 2007 campaign for mayor of Philadelphia, and disguised the funds as a loan to a consulting company. After he lost the election, Fattah returned to the donor $400,000 that the campaign had not used and arranged for Educational Advancement Alliance, a non-profit entity that Fattah founded and controlled, to repay the remaining $600,000 using charitable and federal grant funds that passed through two other companies. To conceal the contribution and repayment scheme, the defendants and others created sham contracts and made false entries in accounting records, tax returns and campaign finance disclosure statements. Also in FY 2016, Arthur Budovsky (NY) was convicted and sentenced to twenty years in federal prison for running a massive multi-million dollar money laundering enterprise through his company Liberty Reserve, a virtual currency that was used by cybercriminals around the world. Liberty Reserve billed itself as the Internet’s “largest payment processor and money transfer system” and operated one of the world’s largest and most widely used digital currencies. Budovsky designed Liberty Reserve with a focus of attracting criminals that conducted Ponzi schemes and trafficked in stolen credit cards. In January 2016, within days of his trial date, he pled guilty to one count of conspiring to commit money laundering. Budovsky admitted to laundering between $250 million and $550 million in criminal proceeds linked to Liberty Reserve accounts based in the United States. The Department will continue to pursue criminal and civil litigation to protect the federal fisc and hold accountable corrupt officials and those who commit fraud; and promote transparency in markets by preserving competition and protecting consumers and investors.
