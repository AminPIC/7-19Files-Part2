</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>The abuse, neglect, exploitation, and trafficking of children, and vulnerable populations, causes irrevocable harm to victims and society. Ensuring that all citizens, particularly children and other vulnerable populations, can live without being disturbed by sexual trauma, exploitation, or human trafficking are more than criminal justice issues, they are societal and moral issues. Despite efforts to date, the threat of these crimes remains very real. In the broadest terms, the goal of the Department is to prevent child exploitation, abuse, hate crimes, and human trafficking from occurring, and protect every person from the physical and mental traumas associated with these crimes.

The abuse, neglect, exploitation, and trafficking of children, and other vulnerable populations, causes irrevocable harm to victims and society. The Department of Justice’s priority of upholding the civil and constitutional rights of all Americans, particularly the most vulnerable members of our society, remains of the highest importance.

For the FY 2016 – 2017 Vulnerable People Priority Goal, the Department continued three performance measures from the 2014-2015 goals and established three new ones, for a total of six performance measures. In addition to the six measures, the Department has established two indicators and four milestones focused on American Indian and Alaska Native populations and human trafficking.

Five of the six performance measures have quarterly targets. Of those five measures, four exceeded their FY 2016 4th quarter targets. However, all six performance measures met, or exceeded their annual targets for FY 2016.

Opened investigations concerning non-compliant sex offenders exceeded the FY 2016 Q4 target of 456 by 221, or 48.5%, and the FY 2016 annual target of 1,786 by 134 or 7.5%.

Opened investigations concerning sexual exploitation of children exceeded the FY 2016 Q4 target of 782 by 342, or 44%, and the FY 2016 annual target of 3,127 by 2,298 or 73.5%. Opened investigations concerning human trafficking exceeded the FY 2016 Q4 target of 56 by 16, or 29%, and the FY 2016 annual target of 223 by 77 or 35%.

In FY 2016 Q4, the Department missed its 85% target for favorably resolved Civil Rights [criminal] cases by 22%. However, the Department did meet the annual target of 85% for this measure. The Criminal Section of the Civil Rights Division (CRT) handles criminal prosecutions of hate crimes, official misconduct and human trafficking. These cases are fact-intensive and legally complex. The career attorneys in this section investigate each alleged violation; determine whether charges are warranted; and then present evidence to a court. Although the Criminal Section only brings cases that it believes will lead to a conviction or guilty plea, it cannot control whether a judge or jury ultimately agrees that it can prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Between July and September 2016, CRT’s Criminal Section brought a number of difficult and complex cases. Although it achieved successful resolutions of most cases, it did not prevail in 41 cases.

In FY 2016 Q4, the Department exceeded its 85% target for favorably resolved Civil Rights [civil] cases by 15%, and exceeded its FY 2016 annual target of 85%, by 13%.

Number of human trafficking leads and complaints reviewed by the Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit (HTPU) was a new measure that did not have quarterly targets; however we tracked the progress on a quarterly basis. For Q4, 111 human trafficking leads and complaints were reviewed by Civil Rights Division’s (CRT) HTPU. By the close of FY 2016, HTPU had exceeded its annual target of 154 by 114, or 74%. CRT substantially exceeded its annual target of 154, for number of human trafficking leads and complaints reviewed by HTPU, for the following reasons. The first quarter numbers were atypically high, compared to the second and third quarters, because during Q1, CRT received a substantial backlog. Whereas in Q2 and Q3, HTPU primarily reviewed new matters, as they arose. In the fourth quarter, in addition to reviewing incoming new matters, they focused additional efforts on proactive outreach to law enforcement partners to identify additional matters for HTPU review, and on ensuring accurate entry of matters into relevant databases.

In addition to the six measures, the Department reports the progress of two indicators. The indicators, Number of missing children recovered as a result of USMS fugitive investigations and Number of trainings on human trafficking conducted; do not have annual and/or quarterly targets. For Q4, there were 26 missing children recovered as a result of fugitive investigations, and 10 human trafficking trainings were conducted for federal, state, local law enforcement, non-governmental organizations and international trafficking partners. By the close of FY 2016, USMS had recovered 101 missing children and CRT had conducted 32 trainings on human trafficking.

The Department tracks its quarterly progress toward meeting the following milestones:

Enhance tribal law enforcement practices; sustain crime prevention and intervention efforts. The Department’s Coordinated Tribal Assistance Solicitation (CTAS) provides grant funds to enhance law enforcement practices and sustain crime prevention and intervention efforts, including justice systems planning grants that will support tribes in developing a strategic plan to address the tribe’s specific needs.

• FY 16/Q4 – Begin Phase 3 of the strategic planning process; provide technical assistance on writing a strategic plan with measurable goals and objectives. – IN PROGRESS

Three of the five FY 15 grantees are working to conduct their needs assessment in Phase 2 of the planning process. These are Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation, Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians and Absentee Shawnee. Both Little Traverse Bay and Absentee Shawnee have had staff turn-over but have since found replacements and are working well with their Mentors. Shoshone-Bannock Tribes and Fort Belknap have been delayed in beginning their project, even Phase 1, due to staff turnover. Based on staffing issues that were stated, Phase 3 of the planning has not yet occurred.

Conduct educational outreach meetings with federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement on planning and conducting sex offender operations and tribal-specific compliance operations. U.S. Marshals (USMS) will execute educational outreach meetings on planning and conducting sex offender operations in tribal locations throughout the nation.

• FY 16/Q4 – Conduct the fourth outreach meeting with surrounding tribes in new location; including one educational seminar on planning and conducting sex offender operations in local tribal areas. Assist with two compliance operations in local tribal areas. – MET

The USMS conducted an outreach session in Montana with 87 participants from 36 agencies, offices and tribes; immediately followed by a sex offender registration compliance operation on the Blackfeet Reservation with the Blackfeet Law Enforcement Agency. They also developed and made available a customizable outreach package to assist USMS Sex Offender Investigative Coordinators in planning future tribal outreach initiatives.

This milestone is complete. All activities were accomplished and reported in FY 2016.

Develop training for criminal justice professionals to address public safety challenges in Indian Country. Develop, implement, and support training for federal, state, and local law enforcement, prosecutors, and other criminal justice and social service professionals to address the unique challenges to public safety in Indian Country; and to improve criminal justice services for American Indian/Alaska Native citizens.

• FY 16/Q4 – Complete training modules; update the DOJ Accomplishments in Indian Country, to reflect training success. – MET
