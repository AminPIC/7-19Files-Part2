By 2018, working with the Military Services and nationally-recognized organizations, shape the health and readiness of the force through the following key indicators:


	Prevention: Of four percent of survey respondents who indicated they saw a potential incident of sexual assault developing, 87 percent indicated on a survey that they intervened.&amp;nbsp; The percentage of bystander interventions in sexual assault will increase over 2014 survey results from 87 percent to 95 percent.
	Response:
	
		Increase the overall estimated report rate of restricted (confidential) and unrestricted sexual assault allegations across the DoD from 25 percent to 35 percent.
		Increase the proportion of men reporting sexual assault allegations across DoD from 10 percent to 20 percent.
	
	


Continue to tie this APG into other DoD efforts to prevent sexual assault and respond to victims.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
</APG_Statement><APG_Overview>1) Problem / Opportunity:

Sexual assault is a significant challenge facing the United States military and the nation. It is a detriment to the welfare of men and women in uniform and is antithetic to core military values of trust, dignity, and respect. Although the military has made great strides in sexual assault prevention and response in recent years, sexual assault remains a problem in the Department. According to the 2014 RAND Military Workplace Survey, about four percent of military women and one percent of military men experience a sexual assault in a given year. Based on these prevalence rates, an estimated 18,900 Service members experienced unwanted sexual contact in 2014, down from the 26,000 Service member victims estimated in 2012. However, less than a quarter of them report the allegation to a military authority. The Department’s approach promotes a military climate that empowers all to do their part to prevent sexual assault, and encourages Service members to report the allegations. Increased reporting signals growing trust of command and confidence in the response system. Increased reporting also serves as the primary means by which the Department can provide restorative care and hold offenders appropriately accountable through the military justice system, which in turn contributes to improved force readiness.

As outlined in the 2014 Report to the President of the United States on Sexual Assault Prevention and Response in the Military Active Bystander, “Intervention” is a, “philosophy and strategy for prevention of various types of violence, including bullying, sexual harassment, sexual assault, and intimate partner violence. The approach is based on evidence that people make decisions and continue behaviors based on the cultural conditioning and norms through subtle reactions from others and the resultant expectations of social interaction.” Bystander intervention is unique in that it:


	Discourages victim blaming
	Offers the chance to change social norms
	Shifts responsibility to all Service members


Measuring interventions and reporting rates annually provides an indication of positive cultural change that can be sampled on a re-occurring basis. The Department employs multiple data collection efforts at varying timeframes. The Workplace and Gender Relations surveys for Active Duty and Reserve Component personnel are fielded every two years on off-years from each other.&amp;nbsp; Other surveys and focus groups also occur inside and outside of that timeframe.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

Government Accountability Office (GAO) audit related to Performance Measure #3:
GAO-15-284, Military Personnel – Actions Needed to Address Sexual Assaults of Male Service Members.
Issue(s):


	DoD needs to improve its ability to prevent and respond to sexual assaults of male Service members. DoD has not used all of the available data on male victims, such as analyses that show significantly fewer male Service members than females reporting sexual assault, to inform program decision making.&amp;nbsp;
	DOD has not generally portrayed male sexual assault in its sexual assault prevention training material.


Recommendations: 


	Develop a plan for data-driven decision-making to prioritize program efforts.
	Revise sexual assault prevention and response training to more comprehensively and directly address the incidence of sexual assault allegations by male service members and how certain behavior and activities – like hazing–can lead to a sexual assault.


DoD Actions: The Department has taken steps this past year to build a foundation of data sources to shape policy and programs and to advance the appropriate prevention and response systems that meet the needs of both men and women. DoD’s research and data collection efforts have broadened our understanding of the differences in how both men and women experience the crime of sexual assault in the military. Since 2006, our biennial Workplace and Gender Relations Survey of the force has provided invaluable data on the extent of sexual assault in the military. As part of the 2014 Military Workplace Study, DoD enlisted the support of the RAND Corporation to take a closer look at gender differences in sexual assault patterns. As a result of that study, it appears that the experience of an assault may be interpreted differently. While viewed as an assault by some, other victims might see an act as a form of “hazing.” These differences in how a victim interprets the crime often fall along gender lines. Some men may not even consider the act to be something sexual, but rather abusive and humiliating. In addition, results reveal that men are more likely to report experiencing sexual assault in their place of duty; whereas women are more likely to report experiencing sexual assault outside of the workplace. The Department is incorporating key findings about gender differences into the advocate certification program and training for Service Members, as well as enhancing the male-focused information and resources on the DoD Safe Helpline. Our prevention focus leverages commanders to regularly assess their environments and take corrective action, as appropriate, with sexual assault and hazing being specific targets for intervention. Additionally, these findings motivated the Secretary of Defense to direct that the Department fully evaluate its gender-focused treatment capabilities and provider training to ensure they address the specific needs of women and men.

2) Relationship to Strategic Goal and Objective:

This performance goal supports the Department's mission through the following strategies:


	DoD Agency Strategic Plan (ASP), Goal #2: Strengthen and Enhance the Health and Effectiveness of the Total Workforce; Strategic Objective 2.2: Support and retain the DOD workforce by fostering and encouraging workforce initiatives to ensure employees are trained, engaged and retained.
	Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) 2014, Strategic Goal: Maintain the strength of the all-volunteer force and implement new reforms.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
	DoD Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Strategy, Strategic Objective 1: Deliver consistent and effective prevention methods and programs, Strategic Objective 4: Deliver consistent and effective victim support, response, and reporting options.


3) Congressional Inputs:
The Department works closely with Congress to improve its programs and policies and to eliminate sexual assault from the military. National Defense Authorization Acts for fiscal years 2012 through 2016 include over 75 sections of law and contain more than 100 requirements related to sexual assault in the military, many of which were built on or in parallel with existing Secretary of Defense initiatives. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 alone provided the most sweeping changes to military law since 1968. Additionally, the Congressionally mandated Response System to Adult Sexual Crimes Panel provided over 130 recommendations to the department to improve sexual assault prevention and response in the military. In December 2015, the Department submitted the first comprehensive military justice reform package in more than 30 years to Congress, which includes 37 statutory additions and substantive amendments to 68 current provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Combined, these provisions seek to improve the military justice system’s capability to appropriately and effectively handle sexual assault and sexual harassment cases.

4) Key Barriers and Challenges:
Although the military faces some of the same challenges with preventing and responding to sexual assault as civilian society, there are some unique barriers and challenges:


	Individuals within the DoD come from a wide variety of backgrounds and their past experiences shape their attitudes and behavior, which may be inconsistent with serving in the military. This, coupled with the significant turnover of personnel each year, is a challenge to maintaining force readiness and eliminating sexual assault from the military.
	There is a perceived stigma associated with reporting sexual assault allegations in an environment that idealizes confidence, decisiveness, and strength. Thus, military members are particularly impacted by this stigma, as many are concerned about being mislabeled as weak or experiencing inappropriate scrutiny of their sexual orientation. This is of particular concern with men. The military is roughly 85% male and we estimate that more men experience sexual assault each year than women. However, men report the crime at a much lower rate. Approximately 10% of men estimated to have experienced a sexual assault make a restricted (confidential) or unrestricted report, and approximately 40% of women estimated to have experienced a sexual assault make a restricted or unrestricted report to DoD. We must overcome the stigma and myths that suggest that only weak people are victims of crime.&amp;nbsp;
	Research indicates many civilian and military sexual assault victims fear being blamed for the crime. Victim blaming is often predicated on the false belief that a victim’s behavior somehow caused the offender to perpetrate the crime. We must overcome the stigma surrounding victim blaming within the military environment.
	Maintaining confidentiality in the military environment is difficult, even with the protections afforded certain communications in both policy and law.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
	Fear of negative career impact is also a factor in many victims’ decisions not to report a sexual assault allegation.&amp;nbsp;


5) Mitigation Efforts:
DoD has an existing leadership structure, empowered by law to promote good order and discipline. In seeking ways to eliminate sexual assault, the Department is leveraging its existing culture of honor, dignity, and respect to drive organizational changes that empower every Service Member to take action against disrespectful and dangerous behaviors.
The Department will continue to deliberately solicit victim feedback and engage subject matter experts to inform SAPR policies and programs.

	Raise awareness across the force to the risks of sexual assault through policy, communication campaigns, training, and special events. Members need motivation to intervene, which involves not only awareness of risk but awareness of the impact of a sexual assault on unit and individual readiness.
	(FY17­18) Health Related Behaviors Surveys will be conducted [on a sampling of Service members, across the force (including a subset of Active and Reserve members)] to assess Service member engagement in preventive and risky behaviors impacting health. Information gathered from the DEOMI Organizational Climate Survey (DEOCS) and related surveys are socialized at the Service level Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) program for training implementation and prevention guidance.


Percent increase of sexual assault reports


	Continue collaboration with Service SAPR program personnel through the monthly Change Control Board meetings regarding improvements needed for expeditious and valid data entry.
	Changes to the Defense Sexual Assault Incident Database are currently underway and will be launched in fiscal years 2017 and 2018.
	Data pull for the Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Report are complete and analyses are underway for the congressional report.


Percent increase of the proportion of male Service members reporting sexual assault


	The Workplace and Gender Relations Survey for the Reserve Component will be executed in FY17 and the WGRA will be executed again in FY18.
	The Defense Manpower and Data Center (DMDC) recently completed the 2016 WGRA and the results are currently undergoing analyses. Results from survey will be published with its companion annual report and provided to Congress in 2017.


&amp;nbsp;
</next_steps><progress_update>Q4 Progress Update

Bystander Intervention

Services continue to train and reinforce members on bystander intervention. The DoD Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO) and the Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute (DEOMI) continue to identify gaps in assessment of the prevalence of bystander intervention to educate leaders on how they can encourage unit members to intervene in situations with high risk of sexual assault.&amp;nbsp; SAPRO is developing a prevention plan of action that will educate leaders and bystanders on tools and tactics to further increase rates of bystander intervention.&amp;nbsp;

Percent increase of sexual assault reports

SAPRO will not be able to determine percent increases from FY15 to FY16 until the release of its Congressionally mandated report in May 2017.&amp;nbsp; SAPRO continues to improve upon the capabilities of the Defense Sexual Assault Incident Database (DSAID) platform to document incident and reporting details to understand trends and patterns in sexual assault reporting.

Percent increase of the proportion of male Service members reporting sexual assault

SAPRO and the Office of People Analytics continue collaborations to assess prevalence and population estimates to reduce the gap between those who report experiencing a sexual assault to authorities (assessed using DSAID) and those who report experiencing a sexual assault but DO NOT report it to authorities (assessed using the Workplace and Gender Relations Survey for the Active Component (WGRA)).
